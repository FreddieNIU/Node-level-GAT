If you want to skip our industry introduction and jump ahead to the top five stocks in this list, then head on over to 5 Best Machine Learning Stocks to Buy. Machine learning refers to a set of technologies that enable researchers and others to use large or small datasets to their advantage by making predictions. It often requires breaking the data set into pieces, and depending on the size of the data set, often requires large amounts of computing power too.The basics of machine learning involve two kinds, supervised and unsupervised. In the former, the data set is assigned categories for the conclusions that the software has to reach, and this also involves dividing the data into two sets - one for training the algorithm and the other for testing it. The latter simply involves the software itself identifying the 'interesting' details about the data, and one such technique is principal component analysis, which determines the key explanatory factors of a data set.These techniques have transformed the manner in which corporations handle their data, and one strong beneficiary is supply chain management. Big and small enterprise resource planning software providers now provide machine learning as part of their software suites, and companies use them regularly to drive data driven insights that would have been science fiction just a couple of decades ago.Therefore, the machine learning industry has one of the strongest compounded annual growth rates (CAGRs) that we have come across. For instance, a report from Fortune Business Insights assigns the industry with an astounding CAGR of 38.8% for the time period spanning between 2022 and 2029. It estimates that the sector will be worth $21 billion by the end of this year, and through strong CAGR, it will go on to be worth a whopping $210 billion in just seven years. Driving this demand will be the healthcare sector, as automated data analysis will provide companies with advanced ways of spearheading drug discovery. Healthcare has already proven pivotal for machine learning as drug makers relied on the technology to develop vaccines for the coronavirus pandemic.Story continuesA report from Market Research Future ascribes a similar 38.8% CAGR to the industry and it estimates that by the end of 2030, the machine learning industry will be worth $106 billion. Among the different segments that make up this industry, such as software developers, enterprise resource planning systems providers, and hardware manufacturers, Market Research Future believes that the hardware segment is slated to benefit the most, and enterprise machine learning will have the strongest demand.Therefore, the future is bright for machine learning, and today we will identify the key players in the industry. Some top names likely to catch your attention are Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).Our  Methodology We took a broad look at the industry and identified the different segments that it is divided into. Then, the key players in each segment were identified based on market trends, product strengths, and financial performance. They were then ranked according to hedge fund interest courtesy of Insider Monkey's 895 hedge fund survey for Q2 2022.Best Machine Learning Stocks to Buy11.

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. See our latest analysis for Texas Instruments Texas Instruments' Earnings Per Share Are GrowingIf you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Impressively, Texas Instruments has grown EPS by 19% per year, compound, in the last three years. If the company can sustain that sort of growth, we'd expect shareholders to come away satisfied.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. Texas Instruments shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 45% to 53%, and revenue is growing. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of Texas Instruments' future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.Story continuesAre Texas Instruments Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Texas Instruments, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$153m. We note that this amounts to 0.1% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Texas Instruments but it's still worth mentioning. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.Does Texas Instruments Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?If you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into Texas Instruments' strong EPS growth. Further, the high level of insider ownership is impressive and suggests that the management appreciates the EPS growth and has faith in Texas Instruments' continuing strength. On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research. We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 3 warning signs for Texas Instruments (2 are significant!) that you need to be mindful of.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

Nucor continues to have the strongest credit rating in the North American steel sector (Baa1/A-) with stable outlooks at both Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's.Commitment to Returning Capital to StockholdersDuring the third quarter of 2022, Nucor repurchased approximately 5.3 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $122.24 per share (approximately 17.5 million shares year-to-date at an average price of $134.99 per share). As of October 1, 2022, Nucor had approximately 257,000,000 shares outstanding and approximately $1.49 billion remaining for repurchases under its existing authorized share repurchase program. This share repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no scheduled expiration date.On September 15, 2022, Nucor's board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.50 per share. This cash dividend is payable on November 10, 2022 to stockholders of record as of September 30, 2022 and is Nucor's 198th consecutive quarterly cash dividend.Third Quarter of 2022 AnalysisThe primary driver for the decrease in earnings in the third quarter of 2022 as compared to the second quarter of 2022 was the decreased earnings of the steel mills segment. The decrease in the steel mills segment earnings was caused primarily by metal margin contraction and reduced shipping volumes, particularly at our sheet and plate mills. The steel products segment had another strong quarter in the third quarter of 2022, and its earnings increased modestly from the second quarter of 2022. Raw materials segment earnings increased in the third quarter of 2022 as compared to the second quarter of 2022 as decreased profitability in our scrap brokerage and processing operations was offset by the increased profitability of our direct reduced iron facilities.Fourth Quarter of 2022 OutlookWe continue to believe that 2022 will be the most profitable year for earnings in Nucor's history. As we approach the end of the year, we are seeing increasingly challenging market conditions amid economic uncertainty.We expect fourth quarter of 2022 earnings to be decreased from the third quarter of 2022. In the steel mills segment, we expect considerably lower earnings in the fourth quarter of 2022 as compared to the third quarter of 2022 due to lower average selling prices and lower volumes, with the largest decrease in profitability expected at our sheet mills. The steel products segment is expected to have another strong quarter in the fourth quarter of 2022, but the segment's profitability is anticipated to decrease from the third quarter of 2022 primarily due to typical seasonality experienced in the fourth quarter. The raw materials segment is expected to have significantly decreased earnings in the fourth quarter of 2022 as compared to the third quarter of 2022 due to decreased selling prices for raw materials.Earnings Conference CallYou are invited to listen to the live broadcast of Nucor's conference call during which management will discuss Nucor's third quarter results on October 20, 2022 at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time.

ARE is scheduled to release third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 24 after the closing bell. Its quarterly results are likely to reflect growth in revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share.In the last reported quarter, this Pasadena, CA-based urban office real estate investment trust (REIT), primarily focused on collaborative life science and technology campuses, delivered a surprise of 1.94% in terms of FFO per share. ARE’s performance in the quarter was mainly driven by healthy leasing activity and rental rate growth.Alexandria has a decent surprise history. Over the preceding four quarters, ARE’s FFO per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on each occasion, the average beat being 1.37%. This is depicted in the graph below:Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAlexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAlexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayAlexandria has Class A properties in AAA locations. The high demand for Alexandria’s highly differentiated facilities, especially the key life science segment, is anticipated to have driven decent leasing and re-leasing activity and aided occupancy levels in the third quarter.Favorable demand-supply dynamics and the company’s strong pricing power in its core markets are likely to have played a key role in its rental growth this quarter.Alexandria is focused on maintaining its tenant quality. The majority of its rental revenues come from investment-grade or publicly-traded large-cap tenants. As a result, its long-term lease agreements with these tenants are expected to have generated impressive rent collections in the to-be-reported quarter.Backed by the healthy demand for its properties, ARE is expected to have continued with its development and redevelopment activities in the third quarter.Moreover, Alexandria is expected to have maintained adequate financial flexibility to enhance its market position in the quarter. This is expected to have supported its development pipeline as well.These factors are anticipated to have aided revenues and the net operating income growth of ARE in the third quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues currently stands at $638.8 million, suggesting a 16.6% increase from the prior-year period’s reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly FFO per share currently stands at $2.12, suggesting an 8.7% increase from the prior-year period’s reported figure.However, ahead of the third-quarter earnings release, there is a lack of any solid catalyst to make investors bullish on the stock. Hence, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly FFO per share has been unchanged over the past month.Story continuesWhat Our Quantitative Model PredictsAlexandria does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Earnings ESP: Alexandria has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 26, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis maker of scientific instrument and laboratory supplies is expected to post quarterly earnings of $4.77 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -17.2%.Revenues are expected to be $9.86 billion, up 5.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Thermo Fisher?For Thermo Fisher, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +3.98%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Thermo Fisher will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Thermo Fisher would post earnings of $4.92 per share when it actually produced earnings of $5.51, delivering a surprise of +11.99%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Thermo Fisher appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In reality, it can happen to anyone.Arthur Schrieber Jr. of St. Louis was restless. He just knew his life was going to change the next morning, so he was too excited to sleep.After tossing and turning, Schrieber, 84 at the time, finally got out of bed in the wee hours of May 16, 2017, and put on his best suit and tie.Then he began waiting for the Publishers Clearing House prize patrol to deliver his grand prize that day.""When my dad told me he had won the PCH sweepstakes, bells and whistles went off in my head,"" said Arthur ""Chad"" Schrieber III, a U.S. Bank application developer based in St. Louis. ""I thought, ‘This is not good.'""To make matters worse, a van did pull up in front of the Schriebers' home that day, and someone came to the door with balloons and a gift bag. But it wasn't PCH with a big check - it was a mattress company representative who eventually talked the elder Schrieber into buying a $5,000 bed he didn't need, with an 18 percent loan he couldn't afford.Arthur Schrieber's vulnerability - and Chad's efforts to protect him - eventually sent Chad on a journey to learn more about elder fraud. He researched the problem, developed a presentation to share his prevention tips, and even went on the public radio show Marketplace to talk about his experience.Chad's father, who passed away in 2020, had been the Chief Financial Examiner for the state of Missouri. During his career, he became all too familiar with fraud. Nevertheless, as he got older and his mental health deteriorated, he began to invest in scams that wiped out his retirement savings.Arthur Schrieber would receive solicitations urging him to invest in everything from bitcoins to binary options, in which the payoff is a fixed monetary amount - or nothing. Once a scammer called claiming that a government agency wanted to give him a $9,000 grant - but first he had to wire transfer $750. Arthur was so excited at the prospect he left the house to hop into the car while still on the phone with the scammer. Chad, noticing something was unusual, jumped in the car with his dad and asked him to put the call on speaker.Story continuesInstead of going to a local drugstore to send a money order as the scammer requested, though, Chad had his dad drive to his longtime bank and he explained to the branch manager what was going on. The manager took the phone and handled the scammer. End of scam, or so they thought.""While we were sitting with the banker, who canceled dad's credit card, his phone rings. It was a second fraudster, who said, ‘I heard you may have fallen for a scam.'"" Chad said. ""Then he offered to help my dad get his money back, if my dad would give him 20 percent of whatever they could return to him.""This is key in my presentations - this isn't just someone at their home random-dialing numbers,"" Chad said. ""These are organizations with business plans, processes and procedures.""Sadly, the Schriebers' situation is not uncommon. The National Council on Aging (NCOA) reports that sweepstakes scams, government impersonation scams and robocall scams are the most common forms of elder fraud scams. NCOA estimates that in 2021, there were more than 92,000 older victims of fraud resulting in $1.7 billion in losses - a 74% increase in losses compared to 2020. Consumer Reports, though, noted that estimates of the financial impact of elder fraud losses may in fact be much higher, potentially costing families nearly $36 billion a year based on a broader definition.For Chad, this growing national problem became very personal. Since his dad's death, Chad continues to educate others on fraud tactics and how to combat them.Over time, he compiled so much information that he and his wife, Kelly - who is a cybersecurity expert -put together a guide, ""Outsmarting the Scammers,"" that they've presented many times with hopes of spreading the word more broadly. Chad also participated in an Ask Me Anything with U.S. Bank Employees on the topic.""The angst my dad was experiencing that morning the bed people showed up was absolutely tied to the many emails he was getting saying he was a winner,"" he said. ""It was heartbreaking.""U.S. Bank has a strong enterprise policy on elder and vulnerable adult financial exploitation prevention, says Ratika Hura, Manager - Fraud Prevention Training and Awareness at U.S. Bank. ""This is important work to us, and we want to be a line of defense for elders and their families. In addition to providing training and up-to-date reference materials for our employees, we conduct campaigns to educate our customers and communities.""No one is immune to being scammed, but education can help you reduce your risk. To learn more about elder financial exploitation and cybersecurity, visit the U.S. Bank Financial IQ resources to protect your assets from fraud. You can also talk to bankers at your local U.S. Bank branch, who can help you identify fraud ""red flags"" and assist you with ways to prevent it.5 tips to keep your loved ones safe from scammers from Chad:Watch out for an increase in calls, texts or emails.Set up a meeting between your loved one, yourself and your loved one's banker, to understand how the bank can help. At U.S. Bank we offer Shared Access, which allows you to monitor your loved one's accounts with their permission.Keep them informed on scam tactics that you are aware of.Be aware of an increase in junk mail, especially when it includes gadgets and trinkets. It indicates the recipient might be on a list of targets for scammers.Let them know they are not alone and encourage them to talk to you if they receive anything suspicious.U.S. Bank, Wednesday, October 19, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from U.S. Bank on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: U.S. BankWebsite: https://www.usbank.com/index.htmlEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: U.S. BankView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/721016/Why-One-Banker-Is-on-a-Personal-Mission-To-Prevent-Elder-Fraud]"

19,04402fc9-b432-3191-8f14-070a4dbaf843,USB,2022-10-20,Recent uptick might appease U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) institutional owners after losing 28% over the past year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/recent-uptick-might-appease-u-130239950.html,1666184559,STORY,"['USB', 'USB-PQ']","[To get a sense of who is truly in control of U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 68% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Institutional investors would probably welcome last week's 10% increase in share prices after a year of 28% losses as a sign that returns are likely to begin trending higher.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of U.S. Bancorp. Check out our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About U.S. Bancorp?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.U.S. Bancorp already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see U.S. Bancorp's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in U.S. Bancorp. Our data shows that Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.1% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.7% and 6.7%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.Story continuesWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of U.S. BancorpThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of U.S. Bancorp in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$87m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 24% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Public Company OwnershipPublic companies currently own 8.1% of U.S. Bancorp stock. It's hard to say for sure but this suggests they have entwined business interests. This might be a strategic stake, so it's worth watching this space for changes in ownership.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.I always like to check for a history of revenue growth.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Hot Stocks To Buy Right Now.One of Wall Street's Biggest Bull Slashes ForecastOn October 17 John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer, slashed his year-end price target for the S&amp;P 500 from 4,800 points to 4,000. Though this is down 17% from the bank's prior target, it still implies a 10% upside from current levels. John Stoltzfus noted that his projections for the end of 2022 factor in a ""massive rally short of a miracle"" based on the current uncertainty and volatility in the markets. Stoltzfus does not see the Fed pivoting by year-end, however, he sees the market in an ""extremely oversold"" condition"" which can ""become a catalyst for a modest rally"" as we approach the end of the year.Analyst Sees Stocks Rallying in the Short TermOn October 17 Morgan Stanley CIO, Mike Wilson, appeared on a call with CNBC where he pointed out that his ""intermediate-term view is more constructive"" and explained why he sees a rally in stocks in the short term. Mike Wilson said that he does not think it is a ""cost-push inflation"" situation, it is rather a ""demand-pull inflation"" situation and is ""very serious"". Here are some comments from Mike Wilson:""We think an earnings recession, and a technical recession at some point, will play through and that's not fully priced... We've had a bearish view all year, we think the 200-week moving average is a really important technical level that a lot of people don't talk about... The bear market is not over, but you can have major moves off of these technical support levels... We've been bearish all year and it's time for some relief...We overheated, the Fed reacted to that, financial conditions are tightening, and now we are gonna feel the effects of that on growth, mostly next year. the good news is the market has already discounted almost 100% of what the Fed's done at this point and I would say that they have discounted very little of the earnings impact that's going to be felt next year...We're not calling for rates to fall down, but maybe they will just stop going up, and that can be enough for equity markets to get excited...""Story continuesAs of October 17, the S&amp;P 500 has tanked 23% year to date, the Nasdaq is down 32% for the year, and the Dow has lost about 17% since the beginning of 2022. Markets have been hit hard amid high inflation, rising interest rates, and supply-demand imbalances.

24,a5cdcb3f-116e-3592-8c6c-aa4ee4c7a3ae,EW,2022-10-20,Edwards Lifesciences (EW) to Report Q3 Results: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/edwards-lifesciences-ew-report-q3-140102212.html,1666188062,STORY,"['EW', 'MASI']","[Edwards Lifesciences (EW) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis medical device maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.62 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +14.8%.Revenues are expected to be $1.34 billion, up 2.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.42% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Edwards Lifesciences?For Edwards Lifesciences, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.81%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Edwards Lifesciences will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Edwards Lifesciences would post earnings of $0.63 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.63, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Edwards Lifesciences doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, Masimo (MASI) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.92 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -2.1%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $533.96 million, up 73.7% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Masimo has been revised 0.6% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, reflecting an equal Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Masimo will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see some more of the cheapest states to live in the US, go directly to 5 Cheapest States To Live In The US.The United States is a huge country with 50 different states. Given geographical and economical diversity, each state is different.Some states are very expensive to live such as Hawaii where there isn't all that much land and real estate prices are high. Given real estate prices are high, the cost of many other services are high as well.Other states, meanwhile, are pretty affordable to live such as Texas which has a huge land mass and bountiful energy resources. With cheaper energy, a lot of consumer products are also a little bit cheaper.In terms of the difference in the cost of living between states, there can be a pretty wide gap between the top and the more affordable states. For Hawaii, for instance, the state had a cost of living that's more than twice as high as Texas according to the 2022 second quarter cost of living composite index. A big reason for the expensive costs to live was that housing which was over 3 times the national average in terms of the index.InflationSource: Federal Reserve.Inflation has been a problem recently. For September, the core consumer price index rose 6.6%, marking a 40 year high. Although the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates, the increase in rates will take time to take effect. According to a Bloomberg survey of economists October 7-12, core inflation is still expected to be 4.1% for the first quarter of 2023 and 3.3% for the third quarter of 2023 before falling to an expected 2.6% for the first quarter of 2024.Although incomes could increase when there is inflation, not everyone's income rises as much as inflation. As a result, inflation could increase the cost of living.CompaniesSome companies make products or services that make life more affordable.Retailers like Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) have helped lower the price of products given their efficient distribution and scale.  Wholesalers like Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) have helped pioneer bulk buying to lower costs further. Discounters like Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) have also helped make some items very affordable as well.Story continuesIn terms of tech companies, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is making life more affordable by competing in logistics which could help lower distribution costs in the future. The company is also investing heavily in AI, machine learning, robotics, drones, and more to improve its logistics efficiency.Lastly, tech giant Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is also helping make life more affordable by keeping the prices of its most popular products such as search and online videos free. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is also investing in AI which could help one day pioneer technology that will lower prices in many different sectors.In terms of their stocks, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has fallen around 7% year to date versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of around 22% as of 10/18. In terms of analyst commentary, recently Corey Tarlowe of Jefferies raised his price target on Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) to $165 from $161 saying the company is well positioned in the environment given some higher income customers trading down. Tarlowe has a 'Buy' rating on Walmart Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) shares are down about 30% year to date due to the broader market weakness. While it's stock is lower, there are still things to like about Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Polen Global Growth Fund commented on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q1 2022 investor letter earlier in year,Amazon has done a terrific job managing through the pandemic, in our view. Many companies struggled to pivot their business model during COVID-19, which represented an existential threat. Amazon had the opposite problem – a surge in demand. The company leaned into this by entering an extremely heavy investment cycle, doubling its fulfillment network and headcount over the past two years. To put this into context, Amazon added 273,000 employees in the last half of 2021 on top of over 400,000 employees the prior year. The company has also made significant Capital Expenditures, adding IT infrastructure for AWS and transportation capacity during this period. This all took place in the face of inflation related to wage increases and higher pricing from third-party carriers supporting the company’s fulfillment network. These heavy investments paid off—AWS grew 40% year over year, reached a $71B annual run rate, and total company revenue posted a two-year annual compounded growth rate of 25%. We believe this heavy investment cycle, like Amazon’s previous ones, will continue to support ongoing growth and will further separate Amazon from its competition while also providing the ability to increase margins through economies of scale. With respect to the margins specifically, AWS and Advertising – two fast-growing businesses – continue to contribute greater operating earnings to the overall business. We believe management has done an excellent job managing through this period and that the company is even stronger today than when COVID-19 first began to spread around the world.252 hedge funds in our database owned shares of Amazon.com, Inc.

Brad, over to you.BRAD SMITH: All right, taking a look at the major averages here, as we've struck the top of the 10:00 AM hour, 30 minutes into trade. And I want to give you a three-day look at what's kind of taking place here over the course of this week, even despite today's little blippity blip. We are seeing us hold on to a three-day gain of about 2.8% here for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The NASDAQ composite, you're seeing that hold onto gains of about 3.7% over that three-day period. But here today, right now, down by about 6/10 of a percent 35 minutes into trade.Also, the S&amp;P 500, you're seeing that lower on the day. That's down by about half a percent. We ran through some of the sectors earlier, but I'd love to shift your attention over to retail, as we're keeping an eye on some of those names, especially within that consumer discretionary construct or discussion here, and especially going into a holiday season where we're still going to be looking through Amazon, Walmart, and some of these sales that are set to commence that have already actually kicked off. Walmart actually announcing this morning that they are not going to be open on Thanksgiving. That continues what we had seen over some recent years as well in 2020 and 2021.And so keep a close eye on these retail names. Amazon down by about 1.7%. Walmart down by about 2/10 of a percent. Target also lower on the day by about 6/10 of a percent. So that's a retail roundup, if you will, for right now at the top of the 10:00 AM hour. Julie, over onto you.

32,4bbb9a03-eda9-361c-9752-65268225c09b,WMT,2022-10-20,Is Walmart Inc.'s (NYSE:WMT) Latest Stock Performance Being Led By Its Strong Fundamentals?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-inc-nyse-wmt-latest-130249501.html,1666184569,STORY,['WMT'],"[Walmart's (NYSE:WMT) stock up by 2.7% over the past three months. Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term financial health, we decided to study the company’s fundamentals to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on Walmart's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. See our latest analysis for Walmart How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Walmart is:16% = US$14b ÷ US$86b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.16 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Walmart's Earnings Growth And 16% ROEAt first glance, Walmart seems to have a decent ROE. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 13% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. This probably laid the ground for Walmart's moderate 8.2% net income growth seen over the past five years.We then compared Walmart's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 15% in the same period, which is a bit concerning.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is WMT fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Walmart Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?With a three-year median payout ratio of 45% (implying that the company retains 55% of its profits), it seems that Walmart is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees respectable amount growth in its earnings and pays a dividend that's well covered.Moreover, Walmart is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 35% over the next three years. As a result, the expected drop in Walmart's payout ratio explains the anticipated rise in the company's future ROE to 23%, over the same period.SummaryIn total, we are pretty happy with Walmart's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. As a result, the decent growth in its earnings is not surprising. On studying current analyst estimates, we found that analysts expect the company to continue its recent growth streak.

(RJF) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-raymond-james-financial-140102811.html,1666188062,STORY,"['RJF', 'RJF-PB']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Raymond James Financial, Inc. (RJF) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -2.9%.Revenues are expected to be $2.73 billion, up 1.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.37% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Raymond James Financial, Inc.For Raymond James Financial, Inc.The Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Raymond James Financial, Inc. Will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Raymond James Financial, Inc. Would post earnings of $1.62 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.61, delivering a surprise of -0.62%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Raymond James Financial, Inc. Doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In the creation of the space, the existing structure has been respected, and a second life has been given to the floors, ceilings, lighting and installations,” Lopez said.Mango has set three more store openings this year in Florida: a 4,300-square-foot store in the Aventura Mall in November; a 4,100-square-foot store in the Florida Mall located near the Orlando International Airport, and a 2,800-square-foot store in the Miami International shopping center, near the Miami International Airport. There already is a Mango store in the Dadeland mall in Miami.With the four Florida openings, Mango will have at least 10 stores in the U.S. by the end of this year. Mango in the U.S also sells via mango.com, Nordstrom and Macy’s.Story continuesIn 2023, the company will continue to grow in Florida with stores in cities such as Boca Raton, as well as extending its presence with openings in Georgia, Texas and California.Last May, the Spanish fashion brand opened a three-level, 22,600-square-foot Manhattan flagship, situated at 711 Fifth Avenue.

Mango also has two stores in Puerto Rico.The company strengthened its commitment to the North American market in late 2017 with the refurbishment of its SoHo store and its store in American Dream. Also in the U.S., the company sells online via the Mango.com website and via the Nordstrom and Macy’s websites. Globally, the company has stores in more than 110 markets.]"

(NYSE:JWN) lately. Earlier this week, the company announced its Chief Financial Officer (CFO) role would exchange hands by year end, and just last month, the company adopted a ""poison pill,"" after Mexico-based peer bought a 9.9% passive stake in the company. This so-called ""poison pill"" will prevent investors from amassing more than 10% of Nordstrom's shares. The equity has seen its fair share of choppy trading amid all this, with several attempts to close up a late-August bear gap met with resistance at the $20 mark. Another layer of resistance has emerged at the security's 70-day moving average, too, which could spell out even more trouble for JWN in the coming month.A study from Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White shows Nordstrom stock coming back within on standard deviation of this trendline after a lengthy period below here.

A similar move from its current perch at $19.16 would put at $17.58, which coincidentally marks the level the security bounced from late last week.jwn oct 19Analysts are hesitant on JWN, with just three of the 14 in coverage calling it a ""strong buy."" Meanwhile, short sellers are starting to hit the exits, off 7.3% in the last two reporting periods, though these bears are still firmly in control. Short interest makes up 23.6% of the stock's available float, or over three days' worth of pent-up buying power.With all his said, now might be a good time to speculate on JWN's next move with options. The security's Schaeffer's Volatility Index (SVI) of 67% stands higher than just 26% of annual readings. In other words, options players are pricing in relatively low volatility expectations at the moment.]"

39,4a9ced73-9527-39dc-9dc8-dd8874f657e8,JWN,2022-10-20,Exclusive: Nordstrom CFO Anne Bramman explains why she decided to step down after guiding the company through the pandemic,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-nordstrom-cfo-anne-bramman-102904786.html,1666175344,STORY,['JWN'],"[Good morning,Last week, Nordstrom CFO Anne Bramman was among the finance chiefs on a panel session that I moderated about the evolving role of CFOs. And this week, Bramman talks with me about her latest life update.After more than five years, she has decided to step down from her role as CFO. Nordstrom made the announcement on Monday evening. I spoke with Bramman on Tuesday.“I'm grateful for the opportunity, but I'm ready to do something different with my career,” she told me. ""I'm really looking to take on the next chapter. I’m not sure what that’s going to look like. I’m going to take a quick sabbatical and spend some time with family and friends.” And at the helm of finance at a retail company, ""I’ve never had the holidays off, so I’m really excited by that.""Although she’s still deciding on her next step, “What I am focused on is moving to a company to build and grow a business and a leadership team,” she told me.Bramman will remain with Nordstrom through the reporting of the company’s third quarter 2022 financial results. Her last day will be Dec. 2.“Since she was named CFO in 2017, Anne's leadership has been vital in helping us in many areas, particularly navigating the numerous challenges of the last few years,” Nordstrom, Inc. CEO Erik Nordstrom said in a statement. “As a result of Anne's guidance through the pandemic, Nordstrom has the financial strength and flexibility to successfully manage through a changing environment.”Nordstrom reported in August Q2 earnings of $126 million, an increase from $80 million in the same quarter last year. In addition, net sales also increased 12% to $3.99 billion, compared to $3.57 billion last year during the same period.""The retail sector is facing headwinds this holiday season and into 2023,” Hilding Anderson, head of retail strategy for North America at Publicis Sapient, a digital consulting company, told me. ""For Nordstrom, they seem well positioned to recognize revenue growth from their core business, and have a strong holiday season on the backs of higher-income consumers, although their Nordstrom Rack business will see higher discounts and lower velocity.”Story continues'Leave it better than you found it'Bramman says she had been pondering the decision for a while, but felt now was the time to step down. “I've been having conversations with Erik and Pete [president and chief brand officer at Nordstrom],"" she explained. “I felt a couple of things. One, the company, financially, was in a solid position. We've really gotten ourselves into a good situation coming out of the pandemic. The cash flows are strong.”From a financial health perspective, Nordstrom is in “a great place to weather the storms out there,” Bramman says. “We’re coming off a couple of good quarters,” she says. “We've maintained our guidance for the second half of the year.”Bramman also believed her team was prepared to continue Nordstrom’s momentum. “I've worked really hard to build a team, and it’s never been stronger,” she says. In particular, Bramman has been working to develop Michael Maher, Nordstrom's SVP and chief accounting officer, to take on interim roles, she says. “I felt like the company was in good hands as they thought through what they wanted in the next CFO position.” Maher was appointed interim CFO upon Bramman's departure. Nordstrom has begun an internal and external search for a permanent finance chief.Looking back at her five and a half years on the job, “I certainly saw some things I never thought I would see, and took on some challenges,” Bramman told me. Flexibility was key.“I was on my fourth day on the job, and Blake Nordstrom pulled me aside and said, 'The family’s thinking about maybe going private.' So, that was week one.” But Nordstrom wound up remaining public. The brand, the culture, the customer focus, and a company motto, “‘Leave it better than you found it,’ are all pieces that I'm going to take with me no matter where I go,” Bramman says.I asked her what she’ll do on her first official day off. “I'm a triathlete,” she says. “I completed my tenth Half Ironman a couple of months ago. I’ve done Ironmans as well. So, I suspect it will probably be something around biking, cycling, or running.”See you tomorrow.Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.comMore news on women in leadership: Stephanie Ferris tapped as next CEO of FIS, making her one of the most powerful women in fintech Event: Join us for Fortune’s Emerging CFO event, “Rethinking KPIs in the Digital Era,” from 11 a.m.-noon ET today.

Earnings of Insurance, one of the Finance sector industries, are estimated to drop 7.3% while revenues are expected to increase 1.2%.

Swiss Re estimates claims stemming from Hurricane Ian claims in the range of $50 billion to $65 billion. The Progressive Corporation incurred $760 million of catastrophe losses due to Hurricane Ian in the third quarter of 2022 that weighed on its quarterly results. Arch Capital Group expects pre-tax net catastrophe losses of $530 million to $560 million across the property casualty insurance and reinsurance segments for the third quarter.Story continuesInsurers witnessed improved pricing in the third quarter of 2022. An active catastrophe environment accelerated the policy renewal rate and aided better pricing. These, coupled with reinsurance programs, favorable reserve development and solid capital level, are likely to have aided underwriting profitability.Insurers, being beneficiaries of an improving rate environment, are expected to come up with improved investment results. The third quarter itself saw two rate hikes.  A larger investment asset base and alternative investments in private equity, hedge funds, and real estate, among others, coupled with an improving rate environment, are expected to have aided net investment income, an important component of insurers’ top line.Life insurers have been redesigning products by moving away from guaranteed savings products toward protection products of unit-linked savings products. Also, life insurers continue to roll out investment products that provide bundled covers of guaranteed retirement income, life and healthcare to cater to customers preferring policies with “living” benefits more than those with death benefits. Increasing demand for protection products is likely to have driven sales.The insurance industry continues to invest in digitalization. Accelerated digitalization is likely to have saved costs and driven margin expansion.Banking on operational efficiency resulting in a solid capital position, insurers continue to engage in strategic mergers and acquisitions, build on a niche, expand globally, diversify their portfolio and deploy capital to make dividend hikes and pay special dividends. Share buybacks are expected to have provided an additional upside to the bottom line.Potential Q3 OutperformersMetLife is an insurance-based global financial services company providing protection and investment products to a range of individual and institutional customers.  Its focus on launching insurance products in different fields is likely to have aided premium growth. Cost control, improving efficiency and streamlining of business are likely to have added to the upside.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MetLife’s third-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.16, suggesting a decrease of 51.5% from the year-ago reported figure.

MET, Prudential Financial Inc. PRU, Reinsurance Group of America Incorporated RGA, Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies Inc. MMC and Aflac Inc. AFL which are poised to outshine the Zacks Consensus Estimate in third-quarter earnings. These stocks have the ideal combination of two ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy), #3 (Hold) — to surpass expectations. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Factors Likely to Impact Q3 ResultsThe third quarter of 2022 bore the brunt of Hurricane Ian. Swiss Re estimates claims stemming from Hurricane Ian claims in the range of $50 billion to $65 billion. The Progressive Corporation incurred $760 million of catastrophe losses due to Hurricane Ian in the third quarter of 2022 that weighed on its quarterly results. Arch Capital Group expects pre-tax net catastrophe losses of $530 million to $560 million across the property casualty insurance and reinsurance segments for the third quarter.Insurers witnessed improved pricing in the third quarter of 2022. An active catastrophe environment accelerated the policy renewal rate and aided better pricing. These, coupled with reinsurance programs, favorable reserve development and solid capital level, are likely to have aided underwriting profitability.Insurers, being beneficiaries of an improving rate environment, are expected to come up with improved investment results. The third quarter itself saw two rate hikes.  A larger investment asset base and alternative investments in private equity, hedge funds, and real estate, among others, coupled with an improving rate environment, are expected to have aided net investment income, an important component of insurers’ top line.Life insurers have been redesigning products by moving away from guaranteed savings products toward protection products of unit-linked savings products. Also, life insurers continue to roll out investment products that provide bundled covers of guaranteed retirement income, life and healthcare to cater to customers preferring policies with “living” benefits more than those with death benefits. Increasing demand for protection products is likely to have driven sales.The insurance industry continues to invest in digitalization. Accelerated digitalization is likely to have saved costs and driven margin expansion.Banking on operational efficiency resulting in a solid capital position, insurers continue to engage in strategic mergers and acquisitions, build on a niche, expand globally, diversify their portfolio and deploy capital to make dividend hikes and pay special dividends. Share buybacks are expected to have provided an additional upside to the bottom line.Story continuesPotential Q3 OutperformersMetLife is an insurance-based global financial services company providing protection and investment products to a range of individual and institutional customers.  Its focus on launching insurance products in different fields is likely to have aided premium growth.

This compares to earnings of $1.15 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 11.90%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this casino operator would post earnings of $1.08 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.11, delivering a surprise of 2.78%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Monarch Casino , which belongs to the Zacks Gaming industry, posted revenues of $133.73 million for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9.70%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $111.63 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Monarch Casino shares have lost about 16.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -22%.What's Next for Monarch Casino?While Monarch Casino has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Monarch Casino: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock.

47,be988ef2-5be5-30c7-b458-29fca6bed8d7,IT,2022-10-20,Gartner Says 89% of Board Directors Say Digital is Embedded in All Business Growth Strategies,Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gartner-says-89-board-directors-182900166.html,1666204140,STORY,['IT'],"[Only 35% of Board Directors Have Achieved or Are on Track to Achieving Digital Transformation GoalsORLANDO, Fla., October 19, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Eighty-nine percent of board directors say that digital business is now embedded in all business growth strategies, according to a new survey from Gartner, Inc. However, just 35% of board directors report that they have achieved or are on track to achieving digital transformation goals.""Boards of directors (BoDs) have reached a point where digital business strategy and overall business strategy are one and the same,"" said Jorge Lopez, Distinguished VP Analyst at Gartner. ""While CIOs have made significant progress leveraging technology for operational excellence, this is not enough to realize the strategic business benefits that BoDs are looking for from digital investments.""As enterprises increasingly operate in a world of constant disruption, the most future-savvy boards are considering how upheavals and risks can serve as a source of opportunity. CEOs and CIOs will need to adopt this mindset as technology plays an ever-expanding role in driving business success.""Gartner analysts presented the survey findings during Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo™ 2022, taking place here through Thursday. The 2023 Gartner Board of Directors Survey was conducted via an online survey from June through July 2022 among 281 respondents in North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia/Pacific, who are in a board of director role or a member of the corporate board of directors.CEOs Seen as Responsible for Driving Digital BusinessBoDs cited CEOs as the primary leader responsible for driving digital business initiatives within the enterprise, selected by 28% of survey respondents. This is ahead of the CTO and CIO, cited as the primary digital leader by 19% and 14% of board directors, respectively.""Historically, boards have looked to IT to lead digital business,"" said Partha Iyengar, Distinguished VP Analyst at Gartner. ""Yet given the macro and strategic benefits boards are now expecting from digital business, they now rightly expect to hold the CEO directly accountable for its success, similar to the accountability that CEOs have for enterprise revenue or growth.""Story continuesBoards Look to ‘Breakthrough’ Technologies for InnovationBoards are looking to invest in ‘breakthrough’ technologies that will drive digital business and enterprise success. Forty percent of board directors consider artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning technologies to be imperative to digital business success in their organization, the most-cited response.Board directors cited software enhancement as their second-highest priority among breakthrough technologies, selected as an area for investment by 30% of respondents.""Boards are seeking to modernize and enhance bedrock such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) and customer relationship management (CRM) tools,"" said Lopez. ""In practice they are often complex and rigid, when enterprises need agility and change.""Board Directors Increase Risk AppetitesRisk-taking is a key component of digital acceleration. The survey found that 64% of board directors are planning to increase their risk appetite through 2024, climbing seven percentage points from the previous year’s survey findings.""Boards recognize that decision making in a turbulent business environment requires a higher level of risk,"" said Lopez. ""This risk-taking ability is critical to competing at the speed of innovation.""Many BoDs are also expanding their vision for digital business success to focus on a ‘digital economic architecture,’ with 71% of board directors reporting that they are pursuing or plan to pursue such an economic structure this year. A digital economic architecture is the approach that non-digital enterprises can use to achieve similar economic benefits – including growth, profitability, market cap and brand value – as digital giants have achieved via their ‘born digital’ business models.""The evolution from the traditional focus on quarterly returns to a longer-term focus requires a significant change in mindset,"" added Iyengar. ""Boards must recognize and leverage new sources of production and value, which requires a greater ability to accept, and even embrace, risk.""About Gartner IT Symposium/XpoGartner IT Symposium/Xpo™ 2022 is the world's most important conferences for CIOs and other IT executives.

Demand for IT in 2023 is expected to be strong as enterprises push forward with digital business initiatives in response to economic turmoil.""Enterprise IT spending is recession-proof as CEOs and CFOs, rather than cutting IT budgets, are increasing spending on digital business initiatives,"" said John-David Lovelock, Distinguished VP Analyst at Gartner. ""Economic turbulence will change the context for technology investments, increasing spending in some areas and accelerating declines in others, but it is not projected to materially impact the overall level of enterprise technology spending.""However, inflation has cut into consumer purchasing power in almost every country around the world. Consumer purchasing power has been reduced to the point that many consumers are now deferring 2022 device purchases until 2023, driving spending on devices down 8.4% in 2022 and 0.6% in 2023.""Gartner analysts are discussing the trends that are impacting the IT market during Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo™, taking place here through Thursday.The technologies that are being maintained versus those that are driving the business are evident by their projected growth rates in 2023. There is sufficient spending within data center markets to maintain existing on-premises data centers, but new spending continues to shift to cloud options, as evidenced by the 11.3% projected growth for software spending in 2023 (see Table 1).Table 1.

However, a July 2022 Gartner survey of more than 200 CFOs found that 69% plan to increase their spend on digital technologies, while the 2023 Gartner CIO and Technology Executive Survey found that CIOs are being tasked with accelerating time to value on digital investments.Story continues""Companies will use digital technology primarily to reshape their revenue stream, adding new products and services, changing the cash flow of existing products and services, as well as changing the value proposition of existing products and services,"" said Lovelock. ""This trend has fed the shift from buying technology to building, composing and assembling technology to meet specific business drivers. This shift is foundational to the growth of cloud over on-premises for new IT spending.""However, as organizations look to also realize operations efficiency, cost reductions and/or cost avoidance during the current economic uncertainty, more traditional back-office and operational needs of departments outside IT are being added to the digital transformation project list.""More detailed analysis on the outlook for global IT spending is available in the Gartner webinar ""IT Spend Forecast, 3Q22: Is IT Spending Recession Proof?""

But in any portfolio, there are likely to be some stocks that fall short of that benchmark. Unfortunately, that's been the case for longer term Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O) shareholders, since the share price is down 28% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return of around 29%. Shareholders have had an even rougher run lately, with the share price down 18% in the last 90 days. But this could be related to the weak market, which is down 8.3% in the same period.Since shareholders are down over the longer term, lets look at the underlying fundamentals over the that time and see if they've been consistent with returns. Check out our latest analysis for Realty Income To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During the three years that the share price fell, Realty Income's earnings per share (EPS) dropped by 11% each year. This change in EPS is reasonably close to the 10% average annual decrease in the share price. So it seems like sentiment towards the stock hasn't changed all that much over time. In this case, it seems that the EPS is guiding the share price.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Realty Income's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Realty Income's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Realty Income's TSR for the last 3 years was -15%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's certainly disappointing to see that Realty Income shares lost 13% throughout the year, that wasn't as bad as the market loss of 24%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 6%, each year, over five years. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

It relied on the Ekofisk North Sea crude grade, produced at a field in Norway where French oil major TotalEnergies has equity, traders said.Ekofisk differentials to dated Brent dropped on Oct. 13 to their lowest since early January as TotalEnergies looked to sell the grade, according to Refinitiv Eikon and industry sources.An Ekofisk cargo is on track for end-October arrival at TotalEnergies' 230,000 bpd Donges refinery, Kpler said, where strike action ended on Wednesday. Walkouts also ended last week at Exxon Mobil's 140,000 barrel per day (bpd) Fos-Sur-Mer and 240,000 bpd Port Jerome-Gravenchon oil refineries.However, Exxon Mobil expects a full restart at its refineries to take 2-3 weeks. And analysts expect regional crude prices to remain subdued for this time following stock builds.French crude inventories have risen by 13% compared with a month ago and are at 14 month-highs at over 48 million bbls, according to consultancy OilX.Story continuesStrike action has delayed a recovery in North Sea crude prices typically seen around this time of year ahead of refineries returning from Autumn maintenance, said Richard Price, oil markets analyst at Energy Aspects.""When 1 million barrels per day of European CDU capacity comes back online in November, and we have these French refinery strikes coming to an end, it's likely we'll see a lot of upside in the North Sea and dated Brent,"" Price said.European refineries are set to return from a heavy turnaround season in a critically-short diesel market, as traders scramble to secure fuel supplies ahead of a European Union ban on Russian refined products.(Reporting by Rowena Edwards; Editing by Susan Fenton)]"

It was especially hard for small- and mid-cap ETFs, which underperformed severely compared to their large-cap counterparts. According to the SPIVA U.S. Scorecard, a new study by S&amp;P Global, large-cap active fund managers are posting the best returns this year against their benchmarks since 2009. On average, about 68% of large-cap funds underperform their benchmarks, but this study shows that only 51% underperformed benchmark indices in the first half of 2022.

Employees equally chose ""It helps meet my long-term investing goals"" and ""It gives me a stake in the company"" as the top benefit of equity compensation.""We’re seeing that many employees are increasingly paying closer attention to their benefits, especially with labor and expertise in high demand,"" said Scott Whatley, Managing Director &amp; Global Head of Equity Solutions, Morgan Stanley at Work.

The investment firm believes that Salesforce has not taken advantage of its position as a market leader and lags in profitability compared with its peers.During the interview, Smith stated that his firm intends to be a long-term investor and aims at improving the margins of the cloud software maker.What Makes CRM a Lucrative Investment Option?We believe that Salesforce’s impressive growth profile, combined with attractive valuations, is attracting long-term investors. The company has been benefiting from the strong adoption of its cloud-based products and solutions as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation amid the ongoing hybrid work environment.Salesforce Inc. Price and ConsensusSalesforce Inc. Price and ConsensusSalesforce Inc. price-consensus-chart | Salesforce Inc. QuoteIts ability to provide an integrated solution for customers’ business problems is the key driver. We believe that accelerated digital transformation will consistently open a huge growth opportunity for Salesforce. As enterprises progress with digital transformation efforts, the use of cloud services is expected to significantly shoot up in the upcoming period.Per a Grand View Research report, the global CRM software market is projected to witness a CAGR of 13.3% during the 2022-2030 period. With its SaaS-based CRM and social enterprise applications, we believe Salesforce is well-positioned to lead the market.Additionally, the cloud-based customer relationship management software provider’s sustained focus on acquisitions and partnerships is helping it enhance its product offerings and expand across newer markets. The buyouts of Slack, Tableau, ClickSoftware, Mulesoft, Datorama and CloudCraze over the last couple of years have been significantly beneficial for the company.Story continuesSalesforce's partnership agreements with the likes of Amazon AMZN and Google’s parent Alphabet for the firms’ cloud services have been helping it expand its international operations. The company also entered into an alliance with Apple through which it is offering new apps for iPhones and iPads.Salesforce also expanded its global strategic alliance with Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) to focus on new product integrations that will simplify secure data sharing and synchronizing across the AWS and Salesforce services.Accelerated digital transformation and a sustained focus on acquisitions and partnerships are driving its revenues. Salesforce’s revenues have almost doubled from $13.3 billion in fiscal 2019 to $26.5 billion in fiscal 2022. Moreover, the company targets to achieve annual revenues of $50 billion in fiscal 2026.Attractive Valuation ProfileIn our opinion, shares of Salesforce are currently available at a huge valuation discount, which makes it a lucrative investment option for value investors like Starboard Value. CRM stock has plunged 39.5% year to date and currently trades at approximately 51% lower than the 52-week high of $311.75 attained on Nov 9, 2021.Moreover, the stock currently trades at a forward 12-month price-to-sales multiple of 4.50, significantly lower than the five-year high of 9.96 and the five-year average of 5.64.Technology has been among the most-battered sectors amid a broader market sell-off so far this year. However, this sell-off in the broader equity market has led to a massive correction in several technology companies’ stock prices. These companies were considered to be grossly overvalued at the sector’s peak in 2021. With this correction, several tech stocks are currently trading lower than their 52-week high and at an attractive valuation as well despite strong fundamentals.This has led several private equity and hedge fund investors to buy stakes in fundamentally strong companies, which are available at a huge valuation discount. Apart from Salesforce, Starboard Value has a buildup stake in Splunk SPLK and Wix.com WIX.Splunk has lost 34.5% of its value year to date and currently trades at approximately 57% lower than its 52-week high of $176.66 attained on Nov 10, 2021.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 26, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis maker of the Invisalign tooth-straightening system is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.20 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -23.3%.Revenues are expected to be $973.39 million, down 4.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.08% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Align Technology?For Align Technology, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.93%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Align Technology will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Align Technology would post earnings of $2.12 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2, delivering a surprise of -5.66%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Align Technology doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

72,ccaaf044-4c22-33a9-a1e0-6ab1ee8f8d37,MSFT,2022-10-20,Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) five-year earnings growth trails the 26% YoY shareholder returns,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsofts-nasdaq-msft-five-earnings-110028271.html,1666263628,STORY,['MSFT'],"[It hasn't been the best quarter for Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) shareholders, since the share price has fallen 11% in that time. But that scarcely detracts from the really solid long term returns generated by the company over five years. Indeed, the share price is up an impressive 201% in that time. So while it's never fun to see a share price fall, it's important to look at a longer time horizon. Ultimately business performance will determine whether the stock price continues the positive long term trend. Unfortunately not all shareholders will have held it for the long term, so spare a thought for those caught in the 23% decline over the last twelve months.Since the stock has added US$80b to its market cap in the past week alone, let's see if underlying performance has been driving long-term returns. Check out our latest analysis for Microsoft To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, Microsoft managed to grow its earnings per share at 24% a year. This EPS growth is remarkably close to the 25% average annual increase in the share price. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Microsoft's earnings, revenue and cash flow.Story continuesWhat About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Microsoft's TSR for the last 5 years was 220%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveThe total return of 22% received by Microsoft shareholders over the last year isn't far from the market return of -24%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 26%, each year, over five years. If the stock price has been impacted by changing sentiment, rather than deteriorating business conditions, it could spell opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Microsoft better, we need to consider many other factors.

Through this transformational initiative, UBS plans to have more than 50% of its applications, including critical workloads, running on Microsoft Azure, now UBS's primary cloud platform. The partnership furthers UBS's ""cloud-first"" strategy and the modernization of its global technology estate.UBS and Microsoft announce landmark partnership expansionThrough this partnership, UBS will have access to the most comprehensive cloud platform, trusted by more than 95% of Fortune 500 companies, with a rich set of productivity and collaboration tools, enabling the firm to increase the speed at which it can deliver and improve upon its digital experiences for clients and employees. At the same time, Azure will help advance UBS's sustainability initiatives, drive operational efficiencies, and  maintain its standards for compliance and security — providing strong foundations on which to scale UBS's rate of cloud adoption.""Our cloud strategy has fundamentally changed the way we operate, allowing us to reinvigorate our technology estate and reimagine how we build applications for our clients,"" said Mike Dargan, UBS Group chief digital and information officer. ""Closely partnering and collaborating with Microsoft has and will continue to create tremendous value for our clients, our employees, the firm and our shareholders. The developments and learnings that stem from this partnership will benefit the financial services industry and beyond.""Story continuesIn 2018, when UBS announced its cloud strategy, leveraging its strategic partnership with Microsoft, it planned to move one-third of its applications to public cloud within four years, but accomplished this goal early in February 2021. Now, the partnership goes beyond just consuming cloud services to include the co-development of innovations and greater collaboration in areas like carbon reduction.""UBS is a forward-thinking leader in the financial services industry, and Microsoft has been fortunate to co-develop innovative applications that meet complex, regulatory requirements with their engineering teams over the past several years,"" said Scott Guthrie, executive vice president, Cloud + AI, Microsoft. ""Our expanded partnership will continue to accelerate the organization's ambitious digital transformation plans, applying the power of the Microsoft Cloud to equip UBS with the agility and reliability to deliver for their clients.""Advancing digital sustainabilityIn line with the firm's sustainability goals, UBS continues to move certain technology platform workloads from its on-premises and private cloud servers to Azure. In some use cases, this has resulted in the energy consumption of these workloads to be reduced by up to 30% to date.Together, UBS and Microsoft also co-developed a Carbon Aware API, an open-source solution that provides recommendations on how to schedule workloads that require heavy compute power during times when clean, renewable or low-carbon sources of electricity are most available. They then provided their solution to the Green Software Foundation so it could be shared with large and small companies around the world.Enhancing client and employee experiences with artificial intelligenceUBS and Microsoft are implementing and further exploring ways in which artificial intelligence and data can be used to enhance services for clients and employees. For example, in Switzerland, UBS is currently operating two applications that utilize conversational AI capabilities to respond to client e-mail inquiries.Unleashing innovation and driving greater business insights on a trusted platformTo support UBS's ""cloud-first"" strategy and further drive innovation, Microsoft actively brought its Azure confidential computing services to Switzerland. This provided UBS with a new functionality to protect and secure data sharing internally across all of UBS's business divisions, while maintaining the bank's compliance and security standards. As a result, UBS can now develop additional business insights and uncover new opportunities for innovation for its clients and employees.In addition, UBS will leverage Microsoft Power Platform — including Power Apps and Power Automate — which will provide employees with the ability to quickly build professional-grade applications, create automated workflows and connect disparate data sources.About UBSUBS convenes the global ecosystem for investing, where people and ideas are connected and opportunities brought to life, and provides financial advice and solutions to wealthy, institutional and corporate clients worldwide, as well as to private clients in Switzerland.

Let’s take a deeper dive into the company’s recent quarterly print.Netflix Q3It was a much better-than-expected quarter for Netflix – revenue, operating income, and membership exceeded the company’s initial forecast, undoubtedly a major highlight.Netflix reported quarterly earnings of $3.10 per share, handily beating the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $2.11 by a double-digit 47%.The company generated $7.9 billion in revenue throughout the quarter, edging out the Zacks Consensus Sales Estimate by 1%.Following back-to-back quarters of subscriber losses, Netflix provided investors with much-needed positive news; NFLX added roughly 2.4 million net new paid subscribers, more than double the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 1.1 million, bringing the overall subscriber count to approximately 223.1 million.Further, the company’s lower-priced ad-supported plan is slated to be deployed in 12 countries in November, a massive step for the company.Netflix has been pushing the idea of an ad-supported tier for some time now, looking to add more ways to generate revenue. Netflix stated, “The reaction from advertisers so far has been extremely positive and we believe that more choice, especially for more price conscious consumers, will translate into meaningful incremental revenue and operating profit over time. That said, it’s still very early days and, since we’re keeping our existing plans ad-free, it will take us time to build up our membership base and the associated ad revenue.”Story continuesNFLX previously announced that Microsoft will be its technology and sales partner for its advertising venture.Additionally, Netflix has been undergoing a multi-year evolution of its content model; the company has been transforming its service from licensed second-run content to mostly Netflix originals.The evolution of its content model has proven successful; the streaming giant’s Q3 content portfolio was strong, with Stranger Things Season 4 generating roughly 1.4 billion hours viewed, NFLX’s biggest season of an English language series in its history.Netflix’s limited series, Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story, was also a significant hit, with it now being the second-largest English series in the company’s history with 824 million hours watched.Clearly, it was a strong quarter for the company, with two of its Q3 releases becoming their first and second most-watched English series of all time.The company also provided an optimistic view for its Q4 – it forecasts net new paid subscribers adds of a strong 4.5 million, and average revenue per membership (ARM) is expected to grow 6% Y/Y.Big CompetitionOne of Netflix’s biggest competitors is undoubtedly Disney with its Disney+ service.In fact, the Disney+ subscriber base actually overtook Netflix’s earlier in the year, with 221.1 million subscribers reported vs. Netflix’s roughly 220.7 million.With Netflix now reporting a subscriber base of 223.1 million in Q3, it’s taken back the throne.NFLX holding the title remains valid until Disney reports its Q4 results on November 11th.Disney+ has been growing at an unbelievable pace; the service added 14.4 million subscribers in its latest quarter.Further, DIS also plans to release an ad-supported tier for Disney+, slated to roll out on December 8th of this year, roughly a month after Netflix’s proposed initial rollout.Analysts have been bearish for the upcoming quarter, with four estimate revisions hitting the tape over the last several months. Still, the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $0.60 for DIS reflects a stellar 62% Y/Y uptick in earnings.With Netflix posting a better-than-expected quarter, it seems valid to question Disney’s upcoming quarterly results. The success that Disney+ has displayed has been remarkable, quickly catching up to Netflix. With seemingly no signs of subscriber slowdown, Disney+ can easily take back the top streaming position if it posts a strong quarter.This back-and-forth war between the two streaming titans will play out right before our eyes.Bottom LineNetflix shares have been the victim of a deep sell-off in 2022 thanks to a subscriber slowdown being a thorn in the company’s side.However, buyers have stepped up visibly for NFLX shares over the last three months, driving shares for a stellar run. Following the company’s better-than-expected Q3, shares skyrocketed in after-hours trading.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

Get it sent directly to your inbox every Wednesday by 4 p.m. ET. SubscribeWednesday, Oct. 19, 2022The pandemic rubber band is hitting the tech industry.Microsoft (MSFT) made headlines this week when reports emerged that it slashed nearly 1,000 jobs, making it the latest tech giant to respond to economic turmoil.The company characterized its layoffs as “structural adjustments,” stressing that it would keep hiring in “key growth areas.” The cuts still might have surprised some observers. While Microsoft's stock is down 22% over the past 12 months, some competitors have fared worse. Amazon is down nearly 32%. Salesforce plummeted 47%, and Google is down 28%.The recent bad news in the tech industry could be a delayed blow from the pandemic. Interest rate hikes, inflation hovering at 40-year highs and sinking demand are hitting tech companies that have benefited from two years of pandemic-driven growth that saw valuations for some companies eclipse the $2 trillion mark.“As we entered the pandemic, everybody was afraid that there were going to be these disastrous layoffs and it was going to be horrible. And there were, very briefly, in a few places…but that immediately turned around,” TECHnalysis president and chief analyst Bob O’Donnell told Yahoo Finance.“In a weird way, it almost feels like now we're getting some of the impact of the pandemic after the fact,” he added. “I think people are recognizing they maybe over extended their hiring when they expected some of the growth that happened during the pandemic to continue in the tech industry.”Slowing sales, falling stock prices, and layoffsWhile Microsoft is easily the largest tech company to lay off employees, it’s far from the only one. Netflix (NFLX) cut off hundreds of employees as subscriber numbers faltered following the pandemic, and Snap eliminated 20% of its employees.Story continuesMicrosoft is laying off workers as it deals with falling PC sales. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson, File)Meta, meanwhile, is slowly pushing workers out the door via department reorganizations. Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), for its part, shuttered projects at its Area 120 division and asked employees to reapply for jobs elsewhere.Microsoft’s downsizing efforts come as the PC market is experiencing its worst contraction in years. According to Gartner, PC shipments slipped 19.5% in Q3 2022. The reason for the decline? During the pandemic, consumers ran out to stores in search of PCs for everything from work to entertainment. As a result, shipments jumped 32% in Q1 2021 to 69.9 million units. Now that pandemic-powered expansion is rubberbanding back.The drop in PC sales is hitting chip makers, too. Intel (INTC) is expected to lay off thousands of workers, with an announcement likely to take place sometime around its Oct. 27 earnings report. AMD (AMD), Nvidia (NVDA), and Micron (MU) have all been slammed by a decline in PC sales, too. Nvidia already froze hiring for the rest of its fiscal 2023.But Microsoft doesn’t just rely on PC sales. The company’s cloud business has been a growth juggernaut for years. So why the layoffs? Falling share prices could be one reason.“I think there's a sense of internal pressure to deliver better results for shareholders,” O’Donnell said. “And that means increasing the profitability, even though they're already making a lot of money. And I think that's what part of the challenge that we're seeing now is that the market has reacted in such a way, And therefore there's more pressure to deliver better results. And the way you can do that is reduce your costs.”Other tech companies are looking for ways to cut costs without eliminating jobs. Apple (AAPL), for instance, is reducing production of its iPhone 14 Plus, less than two weeks after the smartphone hit the market, according to The Information.Amazon (AMZN), which overextended itself during the pandemic boom, is looking to cut back on the number of warehouses it owns. It has shut down a number of projects including its delivery robot and a product that lets children video chat with distant family members.The downturn could be short lived, at least for techOn Tuesday, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos became the latest corporate titan to predict an economic downturn could come in the next few months. But according to BofA Global Research analyst Wamsi Mohan, such a decline could be short-lived if the Federal Reserve continues hiking rates.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.“If we go into a protracted downturn where inflation is persistently out of control, and we go into an economic slowdown or recession, where both of those are paired together, absolutely, there will be rationalization of jobs,” Mohan told Yahoo Finance.“But if we’re getting to the peak of rates somewhat quickly because the Fed is trying to do this in an accelerated way, we might end up in the first half of next year moving through most of the job cuts that are needed for companies to get back on the operating profit trajectory.”This week brought a sign that tech’s downturn might be fleeting. On Tuesday, Netflix reported better than expected quarterly results, beating earnings and revenue expectations and adding 2.4 million subscribers, after it had reported declines every quarter earlier this year.Netflix was one of the first big tech companies to lose its pandemic sheen, with subscribers sinking after millions signed up while quarantined. Perhaps, after spending time re-connecting with loved ones, Americans are finally ready to get back to their couches — and back to enjoying all that Big Tech has to offer.By Daniel Howley, tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

Clippers NBA team and former CEO of Microsoft, has been a major philanthropist for years. Now he’s investing $400 million to support Black-owned businesses.Ballmer, along with wife Connie Ballmer, will partner with established private equity firms and investment banks to help address the systemic racial inequities that have hindered investment into these businesses in the past, the couple wrote in a blog post Wednesday.“Our goal is to feed that need for venture start-up capital that is missing in the African American community,” Ballmer said live on the Today show on Wednesday. He explained that the investment would go to Black investment fund managers, who would be required to invest at least 30% of that amount into Black-led businesses.“This is an incredible opportunity to invest in an undercapitalized market,” Ballmer said in a statement. “We hope it will signal to other investors the value in giving Black investment managers access to capital.”This isn’t the first time the Ballmers are committing hundreds of millions supporting communities of color. They made a single investment of $200 million in a private equity fund called Project Black, managed by Ariel Investments’ alternate arm, the Wall Street Journal reported. Ariel Alternatives is one of the largest black-owned asset managers in the country.Ballmer served as Microsoft’s CEO for 14 years, succeeding founder Bill Gates. He stepped down in 2014. His net worth is $85.1 billion, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, of which a vast majority remains tied to Microsoft’s shares. The Ballmer Group has been involved in several other philanthropic projects in the past, focusing on economic mobility within underserved communities. They offer grants for initiatives, such as education, professional development and legal services for those from low-income backgrounds. In 2021, the Group had given over $420 million in such grants.Ballmer says their most recent investment will be different because its economic impact will be “self-perpetuating,” but in lockstep with their other efforts.“We haven’t traditionally focused on investments and private equity, but we are just incredibly excited to take this approach,” Ballmer said. Goldman Sachs, Fairview Capital, JPMorgan Chase, Ariel Investment and GCM Grosvenor were named as the partners working with the Ballmer’s multi-million dollar investment.Story continuesThis story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: The economist who just won the Nobel Prize warns the Fed will cause ‘all kinds of trouble’Microsoft’s remote-work-friendly CEO puts his finger on the big problem with working from homeGen Z activists who dumped 2 cans of tomato soup on Van Gogh’s ‘Sunflowers’ plead not guilty in courtSouth Korea stands to lose billions from making K-pop superstars BTS do military service]"

Yahoo Finance's tech editor Dan Howley is joining us now. And obviously, we've been paying a lot of attention to tech and sort of a retrenchment in tech. But you've got a sort of big picture look at what we're seeing.DAN HOWLEY: Yeah, so we're talking about the different variables that are going into the tech industry right now and what we're seeing. And so we usually look at tech, obviously, as kind of not necessarily-- not even close to recession-proof, but we have these stalwarts that you think can weather these storms pretty well. But we're starting to see cracks in this kind of facade.So Microsoft obviously announcing layoffs yesterday. Not saying how many exactly we had, but about 1,000 is what the going number is. That follows their prior move to lay off about 1% of their workforce in July. So Microsoft, despite being this huge cloud company that does incredibly well in that area-- they had double digit growth in cloud in the prior quarter-- they're still having to contend with these kinds of issues.We have Meta and Intel, two of the worst performers right now. Meta stock down 60% year to date, Intel down 49% year to date. We also have Meta pushing people out the door. Not necessarily laying people off, but saying, hey, maybe you're not right for this position, in so many words. We had Google. They weren't necessarily laying people off, but they closed their Area 120 division, which does some research for different products. And so they shuttered those products, and they had these people reapply for jobs.And then when you look at the consumer side of things, we had Apple yesterday basically not announcing, but the reports coming out that they're cutting production of their iPhone 14 Plus. And that was prior to that we had heard that they were reducing some of the production for their iPhone 14 in general to about what the iPhone 13 levels were.Story continuesSo this whole idea of big tech being this huge force, obviously, the idea that them being immune to any kind of market factors is really-- I mean, that's not true at all. But we are starting to see kind of the pain really set in for these companies. And, you know, I talked to some people. They're saying that, essentially, this isn't going to get better until perhaps at some point in 2023, at least for the tech industry. It could go into 2024, though.BRAD SMITH: There's FX concerns that they've cited as well. Many of these tech businesses, if not all of them, are certainly impacted by that. But then you mentioned the consumer side. And if we can go deeper into that, what does that really spell out for this holiday season for some of the consumer technology that they're expecting to move through into households and into consumers' hands?DAN HOWLEY: You know, it's interesting because as, obviously, these-- a lot of products haven't-- companies haven't raised prices on consumer products just yet, right? At least here in the US. Overseas, we've seen Apple raise prices. We saw Sony raise prices on their PlayStation 5. Obviously, a big holiday gift, both of those--BRAD SMITH: If you can find it.DAN HOWLEY: If you can find it. Now it's a little bit easier because not everybody is looking for them again. But, you know, I do think that we're seeing this issue with not just the slowdown in the PC market, which we've been talking about-- that obviously impacts the likes of Microsoft, then Intel, AMD, Nvidia. It's all these kind of knock-on effects to memory chipmakers. But we're starting to perhaps see it on the smartphone side of things. And that would then start to hit the likes of Apple the likes of Samsung, companies in those areas.So I do think that we're going to see fewer people spending on these big ticket items. Video games, I, think are still going to do pretty well. We have a couple that are coming out that are big names. But, you know, I don't know if it's going to necessarily be this huge blowup that we saw during the pandemic where gaming was so big. But that should still continue to do well.But the PCs, the tablets, I don't necessarily know if people are going to be getting those, just because they already bought them. And so you're going into a season where people are trying to save maybe. I don't know if those are going to do particularly well.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, there's only so much space you have in your place to store the next computer. Dan Howley--DAN HOWLEY: You're telling me, man.BRIAN SOZZI: I know, right? Dan Howley, great analysis. Appreciate it.]"

With employees yearning for more educational and career-building experiences, employers will need to pay attention to the differences between these groups to curate programs that keep employees engaged and stimulated regardless of their time in an office.""Employees are more likely to stay with employers who offer robust educational and career-building opportunitiesMost employees (64%) strongly agree/agree that they are satisfied with their organization's opportunities for career advancement, though those who work fully remote are more likely to disagree (14%) than those who are fully on-site (8%) or hybrid (7%). Those who work full-time (69%) are more likely to be satisfied than those who work part-time (58%).Story continuesStill, most employees (63%) say they would be more likely to stay at their organization if they were provided with better career advancement opportunities. Millennials are most likely to hold this view, with 74% saying they'd be more likely to stay at their organization with more opportunities to learn and grow, compared to 63% of Gen X, 62% of Gen Z, and 45% of Baby Boomers. Those who are more likely to agree with the above sentiment also vary somewhat by industry:Construction (76%)Education and health services (60%)Retail, trade, transportation, and utilities (59%)Leisure and hospitality (42%)Note: For purposes of this study, Gen Z is defined as those born between 1997 and 2015, Millennials are defined as those born between 1981 and 1996, Gen X is defined as those born between 1965 and 1980, and Boomers are defined as those born between 1946 and 1964.Employees report specific soft and hard skills are holding them back in their careersThe top soft skills (abilities focused on personal development or interpersonal relations) and hard skills (abilities directly related to one's role) employees believe are holding them back from career advancement are:Soft SkillsHard SkillsTime management – 43% Data analytical skills – 39%Digital literacy – 39%Computer skills – 39% Leadership skills – 37% Software skills – 37%Soft skill differences by generation and between on-site, hybrid, and remote employees Fully on-site, hybrid and remote employees: Those whose work environment is fully on-site (46%) are more likely to say that digital literacy (the ability to use and understand technology) is holding them back than those whose work environment is fully remote (34%) or hybrid (26%). For fully remote employees (34%), communications skills were of bigger concern than for their on-site or hybrid counterparts (28% for both groups).Generational differences: For Baby Boomers, digital literacy is the top soft skill of concern (63%) compared to Gen Z, whose main concern is decision-making (45%).Hard skill differences by generation and between on-site, hybrid, and remote employees Fully on-site, hybrid and remote employees: Fully on-site employees (42%) are more likely to say that data analytical skills are holding them back, than hybrid (38%) and fully remote (35%) workers.

Additionally, the likelihood of marketing skills holding employees back increased as employees got younger: 45% of Gen Z, 39% of Millennials, 31% of Gen X, and 27% of Baby Boomers.""Unemployment is at a 20-year low, and employees are begging for educational offerings that can help them learn and advance,"" said Jeanne Meister, founder of Future Workplace and executive vice president at Executive Networks. ""Employers have taken note, but there is always more they can be doing to encourage retention. For those employers who are unsure what their employees want, the best place to start is to ask. In this competitive hiring market, if you don't offer employees the resources they need to grow, someone else will.""For more insights from this survey, please view the full research report.About the ResearchThese findings are based on a survey conducted across the USA from August 22 to 28, 2022.

These factors are expected to have continued in the third quarter.Within the Human Nutrition unit, strength across its diverse product portfolio, along with the continued momentum in Flavors, bodes well. Strength in alternative proteins, along with gains from the Sojaprotein buyout and healthy demand for texturants, is likely to have aided the Specialty Ingredients unit.The Health &amp; Wellness unit has been witnessing robust quarterly growth, driven by improvements in probiotics, gains from its Deerland Probiotics buyout and solid fiber demand. The Animal Nutrition unit is expected to have witnessed a continued positive demand for amino acids.The company has been expanding its solutions portfolio, which forms part of its Carbohydrate Solutions unit. It has also been utilizing innovative technologies to develop products and boost operating capabilities.

Should the offer fail, we are well prepared to proceed autonomously to develop IQOS and the rest of our smoke-free portfolio in the U.S.""2022 THIRD-QUARTER SUMMARYOn a pro forma basis, adjusted net revenues increased by 6.9% in organic terms, primarily driven by total shipment volume growth of 2.3%, the continued favorable mix shift from cigarettes to smoke-free products, and a favorable total pricing variance.Smoke-free product pro forma net revenues increased by 14.2 on an organic basis, mainly driven by HTU shipment volume growth of 21.9% (to reach 22.4 billion units), partly offset by lower device revenues and the impact of HTU pricing comparisons.Combustible product pro forma adjusted net revenues increased by 4.1% on an organic basis, driven by a favorable pricing variance of 4.9%. Pro forma cigarette shipment volume declined slightly (-0.2%), while international cigarette share increased by 0.2 points to 25.3% on the same basis, including a 0.1 point increase for Marlboro.Pro forma adjusted operating income margin declined by 1.0 point on an organic basis, primarily reflecting: (i) investment to further expand ILUMA and match underlying demand, (ii) the higher initial cost of ILUMA devices and related HTUs; (iii) the impact of supply chain disruptions, notably due to the war in Ukraine; and (iv) global cost inflation.Despite these margin pressures, the company’s strong adjusted net revenue growth, coupled with the positive effects from higher pricing and operating cost efficiencies, drove pro forma adjusted diluted EPS of $1.33, reflecting currency-neutral growth of 8.3%. Adjusted diluted EPS of $1.53 increased by 8.2%, excluding currency, as shown in the table below.Quarters Ended September 30,20222021CurrencyVar. excl.CurrencyReported Diluted EPS$ 1.34$ 1.55$ (0.19)(1.3)%Asset impairment and exit costs—0.02Amortization and impairment of intangibles (a)0.080.01Equity investee ownership dilution—(0.02)Asset acquisition cost—0.03Costs associated with Swedish Match AB offer0.11—Adjusted Diluted EPS$ 1.53$ 1.59$ (0.19)8.2%Less: Net earnings attributable to Russia and Ukraine0.200.150.04Pro Forma Adjusted Diluted EPS$ 1.33$ 1.44$ (0.23)8.3%(a) Includes a non-cash impairment charge of $0.06 per share.

Excluding (i) 2022 adjustments of $0.34 per share, (ii) net earnings attributable to Russia and Ukraine of $0.59 to $0.63 per share assumed for full-year 2022, and (iii) an adverse pro forma currency impact, at prevailing exchange rates, of $0.87 per share, this forecast represents a projected increase of 10% to 12% versus pro forma adjusted diluted EPS of $5.53 in 2021, as outlined in the above table.2022 Full-Year Forecast AssumptionsThis forecast assumes:The full contribution of the company's operations in Russia and Ukraine for the entire year;No asset impairment costs or further other charges related to the company's operations in Russia or Ukraine;No contribution from the operations of Swedish Match in 2022 following the assumed transaction close in the fourth quarter and no further costs associated with the Swedish Match offer;No impact on net earnings or operating cash flow related to PMI's agreement to obtain the full rights to IQOS in the U.S., as PMI is currently evaluating the impact of the agreement on the company's consolidated financial statements;A continued gradual improvement in PMI's duty-free business outside Asia;The impact of delayed production capacity build-up for ILUMA HTUs due to the decision to cancel manufacturing plans in Russia;A pro forma estimated total international industry volume change, excluding China and the U.S., of approximately flat to +1%;Pro forma total cigarette and HTU shipment volume growth for PMI of approximately 2% to 3%, compared to approximately 1.5% to 2.5% previously;Pro forma HTU shipment volume of 89 to 91 billion units compared to 90 to 92 billion units previously (despite continued strong expected in-market sales volume growth), reflecting the impact of global supply chain disruptions, as well as production constraints for ILUMA HTU consumables in the face of better-than-anticipated performance for ILUMA;Pro forma adjusted net revenue growth of approximately 6.5% to 8.0% on an organic basis (compared to 6.0% to 8.0% previously), which includes the adverse full-year impact of moving to highly inflationary accounting in Turkey, effective April 1st, of approximately 0.6 points;A pro forma adjusted operating income margin change of -50 basis points to flat on an organic basis (compared to flat to +50 basis points previously), primarily reflecting:the expectation of a lower gross margin primarily due to:the significant growth in IQOS device volumes (notably in the first-half) as device supply constraints ease, reflecting the replenishment of channel inventories for user acquisition and supply for the accelerated device replacement cycle driven by ILUMA;the higher initial cost of ILUMA devices and initial weight and cost of TEREA consumables, which are expected to decline over time, as with previous innovations;higher logistics costs, including costs related to the use of air freight to support: (i) the strong up-take of ILUMA and related HTU consumables in Japan, and (ii) the re-sourcing of select cigarette brands for Japan due to the war in Ukraine;investments behind the roll-out of ILUMA and to grow production capacity across PMI's smoke-free platforms; andincreasing inflation in raw material and energy prices, and additional supply chain costs due to war-related disruptions;continued commercial reinvestment to support the company's growing portfolio of smoke-free alternatives;largely offset by the continued favorable product mix shift from cigarettes to smoke-free products, coupled with the benefit of further operating leverage and accelerated operating efficiencies;Wellness and Healthcare segment net revenues of around $275 million (including smoking cessation products), with an adjusted operating loss of around $100 million, primarily due to:investments in research and development; andexpenses related to employee retention and recruitment programs;Full-year amortization and impairment of acquired intangibles of $0.14 per share;Operating cash flow of around $10.5 billion at prevailing exchange rates, subject to year-end working capital requirements;Capital expenditures of approximately $1.0 billion;An effective tax rate, excluding discrete tax events, of 21% to 22%; andThe impact on diluted EPS of year-to-date 2022 share repurchases.Factors described in the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements section of this release represent continuing risks to these projections.IQOS in the U.S.As announced in a separate press release today, PMI has reached an agreement with Altria Group, Inc. to end the companies’ commercial relationship covering IQOS in the U.S. as of April 30, 2024. Thereafter, PMI will have the full rights to commercialize IQOS in the U.S. As part of the agreement, PMI will pay a total cash consideration of $2.7 billion, of which $1.0 billion was paid at the inception of the agreement using available cash. The remaining $1.7 billion, plus interest, will be paid by July 2023 at the latest.PMI is currently evaluating the impact of this agreement on its consolidated financial statements.For more information, please refer to the aforementioned press release, available at www.pmi.com.Swedish Match AB: Revised Offer with Best and Final PriceEarlier today, Philip Morris Holland Holdings B.V. (PMHH), an affiliate of PMI, announced an increase in the price in its recommended public offer to the shareholders of Swedish Match AB (Swedish Match) to SEK 116 in cash per share (compared to SEK 106 in cash per share previously).The price in the revised offer represents a premium of 52.5% compared to the undisturbed Swedish Match closing share price of SEK 76.06 on May 9, 2022, and the offer price will not be further increased by PMHH. By this statement, PMHH cannot, in accordance with the Takeover Rules for Nasdaq Stockholm, increase the price in the revised offer any further. The revised offer remains subject to the 90% acceptance condition, which is critical to capture the full potential of the combination.The price in the revised offer primarily reflects the higher net value to PMI related to the portion of Swedish Match’s cash flows generated in U.S. dollars, given currency movements since the initial offer was announced in May. PMI believes that the deterioration in the global economic outlook, equity markets and the interest rate environment since the time of the initial offer strengthens yet further the attractiveness of the revised offer to Swedish Match shareholders.PMI expects the transaction to close in the fourth quarter of this year, subject to the terms and conditions of the offer being fulfilled or waived as further set out in the offer document. Public information regarding the offer is available on the offer website (www.smokefree-offer.com).Should the offer fail, PMI will continue with its strategic alternatives to the Swedish Match combination, including its well-advanced plans for the U.S. commercialization of IQOS -- upon regaining full control after April 30, 2024 -- as well as its broader smoke-free portfolio.War in UkraineSince the onset of the war in Ukraine, PMI's main priority has been the safety and security of its more than 1,300 employees and their families in the country. The company has helped to evacuate more than 1,000 people from Ukraine and relocate over 2,700 others from conflict zones to locations in the country away from the heaviest fighting; provided critical aid to employees who cannot leave or who decide to remain in Ukraine; and provided those who have left the country with a range of support in neighboring countries. The company is continuing to pay salaries to all its Ukrainian employees and is also providing substantial in-kind support to them and their families. In addition, PMI has contributed approximately $10 million in funds and donated essential items across the country.On February 25th, PMI announced the temporary suspension of its operations in Ukraine, including at its factory, in Kharkiv. The company subsequently resumed some retail activities where safety allowed, in order to provide product availability and service to adult consumers, and began to supply the market from production centers outside Ukraine, as well as through contract manufacturing by a third party. PMI is applying increased security and safety measures for personnel. Production at the company's factory in Kharkiv remains suspended.As of September 30, 2022, PMI's Ukrainian operations have approximately $0.5 billion in total assets, excluding intercompany balances.PMI employs more than 3,200 people in Russia and will continue to support its employees there, including paying their salaries, while continuing to fulfil its legal obligations. The company will continue to make decisions with employee safety and security as a priority.On March 24th, PMI announced the concrete steps it had taken to suspend planned investments and scale down its manufacturing operations in Russia, including: the discontinuation of a number of cigarette products; the suspension of its marketing activities; the cancellation of all product launches planned for 2022, including ILUMA; and the cancellation of its plans to manufacture HTUs for ILUMA in Russia.As previously announced, PMI intends to exit the Russian market in an orderly manner, as the complexities of continuing to operate in Russia increase, such as supply chain challenges and financial and banking sector restrictions. The company's Board of Directors and senior executives continue to actively work on options for doing so, in the context of an increasingly complex and rapidly changing regulatory and operating environment, including the requirement to obtain certain governmental approvals for any transaction.As of September 30, 2022, PMI's Russian operations have approximately $2.6 billion in total assets, excluding intercompany balances.PMI recorded pre-tax charges related to the war in Ukraine of approximately $6 million in the third quarter of 2022 and approximately $128 million in the September year-to-date period. This includes charges in Russia related to the cancellation of the planned launch of ILUMA and the planned production of related HTUs.Impairment of Acquired IntangiblesPMI recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $112 million as of September 30, 2022, reflecting the impact of general economic and market conditions resulting in a reduction in future estimated cash flows on certain products within the Wellness and Healthcare segment. The charge was recorded within cost of sales in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings and is excluded from adjusted results.Conference CallA conference call, hosted by Jacek Olczak, Chief Executive Officer, and Emmanuel Babeau, Chief Financial Officer, will be webcast at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on October 20, 2022.

Sterling rallied and the London's FTSE 100 closed higher.""Truss took on an extra relevance to markets because of the policies that she attempted to implement and the markets' reaction to them,"" said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers.""You'd think that if someone was that deeply unpopular the market might rally or the currency might rally when she left. But I think the fact that neither is happening is telling us that markets do crave political stability and we don't have that.""Meanwhile, Finnish telecom equipment maker Nokia and rival Ericsson reported weaker-than-expected earnings, bruised by ongoing patent battles which pressured margins and offset strong demand for 5G equipment.Shares of the companies slumped 7.6% and 14.8%, respectively.More than half of the sectors advanced, with tech rising 1.94%. Telecom was the biggest loser, down 2.5%.The STOXX 600 had snapped a four-day rally on Wednesday, as earnings optimism was snuffed out by worrying inflation reports from Canada and the United Kingdom that fanned fears about more aggressive policy moves from central banks to rein in prices.Story continues""There has been a pretty negative reaction in risk assets and bond markets to the inflation data. It ultimately means central banks like the Fed and the Bank of Canada may have to do even more work to tighten,"" said Stephen Gallo, European head of FX strategy for BMO Capital Markets.Adding to the concerns, data on Thursday showed German producer prices rose more than expected in September, as energy prices soared.However, in a bright spot, Finnish banking group Nordea beat profit estimates, while Hermes added 1.6% after the Birkin bag maker saw a sharp pickup in sales growth with no signs of a slowdown.Among other stocks, Swedish Match AB gained 1.9% after Philip Morris International raised its buyout offer for the nicotine products maker.

ROP is scheduled to release third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 26, before the market open.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ROP’s third-quarter earnings has been revised downward by 13.2% in the past 90 days. However, the company has an impressive earnings surprise history, having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 2.2%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for Roper this earnings season.Factors to NoteRoper’s Application Software segment’s performance is expected to have gained from strength across its Deltek, Vertafore, Aderant, CliniSys and Data Innovations businesses. Strength in the recurring revenue stream, led by strong customer retention and continued migration to SaaS delivery models is likely to have driven the Application Software segment’s performance.Our estimate for Application Software revenues in the third quarter indicates a 9.7% rise from the year-ago reported number. Our estimate for Application Software segment’s gross profit in the third quarter indicates an 8.7% rise from the year-ago reported number. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same indicates an 8.1% rise from the year ago figure.In the third quarter, the Network Software segment is anticipated to have benefited from the strong performance of the U.S. and Canadian freight matching businesses and from strength across the Foundry business owing to solid innovation capability.Our estimate for Network Software segment revenues in the third quarter indicates an 11.7% rise from the year-ago reported figure. For the third quarter, we expect the Network Software segment gross profit to climb 12.7% year over year. The consensus mark for third-quarter Network Software segment gross profit suggests a 6% increase from the year-ago reported number.The company’s Neptune business is fueling the growth of its Technology Enabled Products segment. Roper’s Technology Enabled Products segment is anticipated to have benefited from strong ordering activity in the medical product business, including Verathon and Northern Digital.Story continuesOur estimate for Technology Enabled Products segment revenues in the to-be-reported quarter indicates a 9.9% rise from the year-ago reported figure. We expect gross profit in the Technology Enabled Products segment to inch up 3.8% year over year.However, the rising cost of sales (due to raw material cost inflation) and selling, general and administrative expenses might have hurt Roper’s bottom line in the third quarter. Supply-chain constraints might have also negatively impacted its performance.A strong U.S. dollar might have depressed Roper’s overseas business performance, given its international presence.What Does the Zacks Model Say?Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Roper this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates, which is not the case here, as elaborated below. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Earnings ESP: Roper has an Earnings ESP of +0.00% as both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $3.45.

A non-GAAP financial measure reflects an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company’s operations that, when viewed with the Company’s GAAP results and the reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measure, provides a more complete understanding of the Company’s business. Users of the financial statements are encouraged to review the Company’s financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included below.2022 Investor Day Reconciliation of Non-GAAP to GAAP Financial Measures - 2023 Outlook2023 Consolidated Outlook MetricsNotesRangeRevenues (GAAP) - YoY % Change(10)%(8)%Foreign currency translation impact(a)2%2%Impact from the sale of Business Solutions(b)4%4%Revenues, constant currency, excluding Business Solutions (non-GAAP) - YoY % Change(4)%(2)%NotesRangeOperating margin (GAAP)19.0%21.0%Impact from acquisition and divestiture costs(c)——Impact from the sale of Business Solutions(b)——Operating margin, adjusted, excluding acquisition and divestiture costs and the sale of Business Solutions (non-GAAP)19.0%21.0%RangeEarnings per share (GAAP) ($- dollars)$1.55$1.65Impact from acquisition and divestiture costs(c)——Earnings per share, adjusted, excluding the acquisition and divestiture costs (non-GAAP) ($- dollars)$1.55$1.65THE WESTERN UNION COMPANYNOTES TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES(Unaudited)Non-GAAP related notes:(a)Represents the impact from the fluctuation in exchange rates between all foreign currency denominated amounts and the United States dollar. Constant currency results exclude any benefit or loss caused by foreign exchange fluctuations between foreign currencies and the United States dollar, net of foreign currency hedges, which would not have occurred if there had been a constant exchange rate. The Company believes that this measure provides management and investors with information about revenue results and trends that eliminates currency volatility while increasing the comparability of the Company's underlying results and trends.(b)During 2021, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its Business Solutions business to Goldfinch Partners LLC and The Baupost Group LLC (collectively, the ""Buyer"") for cash consideration of $910.0 million, subject to regulatory and working capital adjustments. The sale will be completed in three closings, the first of which occurred on March 1, 2022 with the entirety of the cash consideration collected at that time and allocated to the closings on a relative fair value basis. The first closing excluded the operations in the European Union and the United Kingdom and resulted in a gain of $151.4 million. The second closing is currently expected to occur on December 1, 2022, and includes the United Kingdom operations. The third closing, which includes the European Union operations, is currently expected in the first quarter of 2023, pending regulatory approvals. Revenues have been adjusted to exclude the carved out financial information for the Business Solutions business to compare the year-over-year changes and trends in the Company's continuing businesses, excluding the effects of this divestiture. While the sale of the Company's Business Solutions business does not qualify for or represent discontinued operations, the Company has also adjusted operating income, beginning in the first quarter of 2022 and concurrent with the sale, to exclude the carved out direct profit of the Business Solutions business. During the period between the first and third closings, the Company will continue to record revenues and operating income for the European Union and United Kingdom operations, but it will pay the Buyer a measure of the profits from these operations, adjusted for other charges, as contractually agreed, and this expense is recognized in Other income/(expense), net. Therefore, the Company believes that providing this information enhances investors' understanding of the profitability of the Company's remaining businesses. These financial measures are non-GAAP measures and should not be considered a substitute for the GAAP measures.(c)Represents the impact from expenses incurred in connection with the Company's acquisition and divestiture activity, including for the review and closing of these transactions. The Company believes that, by excluding the effects of these charges that can impact operating trends, management and investors are provided with a measure that increases the comparability of the Company's underlying operating results.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221019006126/en/ContactsMedia Relations: Claire Treacymedia@westernunion.com Investor Relations: Tom HadleyWesternUnion.IR@westernunion.com]"

The Company plans to release final comprehensive third quarter results on November 1, 2022.Preliminary Third Quarter ResultsThe Company expects third quarter revenue of $1.1 billion to decline 15% on a reported basis, or 6% on a constant currency basis excluding the contribution from Business Solutions, compared to the prior year period. The suspension of operations in Russia and Belarus negatively impacted revenue by approximately three percentage points in the quarter compared to the prior year period, while Argentina inflation benefited revenue by approximately one percentage point.GAAP operating margin in the quarter is expected to be 21.3%, while the adjusted operating margin excluding the contribution from Business Solutions is expected to be 20.6%.GAAP EPS in the third quarter is expected to be $0.45, while adjusted EPS is expected to be $0.42.2022 OutlookToday, the Company reaffirmed its full year 2022 financial outlook provided on August 3, 2022. The outlook assumes that macroeconomic softness will persist for the remainder of the year.During the third quarter, the Company agreed with Goldfinch Partners LLC and The Baupost Group LLC to complete the divestiture of Business Solutions in three closings instead of two, the first of which occurred on March 1, 2022. GAAP figures reflect an expected partial year of Business Solutions ownership, including contractual payments to the buyers, representing profits between the first and third closings, associated divestiture and acquisition costs, exit costs, and an estimated pre-tax gain of approximately $274 million of which $151 million was recognized year-to-date. The second closing is expected to occur on December 1, 2022, and includes the United Kingdom operations, which will result in a pre-tax gain of approximately $93 million, subject to regulatory capital adjustments. The third closing, which includes the European Union operations, is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2023, pending required regulatory approvals, at which time the remainder of the gain will be recognized, subject to regulatory capital adjustments.Story continuesAdjusted revenue growth and operating margin exclude contributions from Business Solutions. In addition, adjusted operating margin excludes associated divestiture and acquisition costs, Business Solutions exit costs, and costs related to the exit from Russia and Belarus. The adjusted effective tax rate and EPS exclude the expected gain on sale of Business Solutions, acquisition and divestiture costs, Business Solutions exit costs, exit costs from Russia and Belarus, and the reversal of uncertain tax positions.The 2022 outlook is as follows:RevenueGAAP: approximately -11% to -13%Adjusted (constant currency, excluding the impact of Argentina inflation and proforma for the planned sale of Business Solutions): mid-single digit declineOperating Profit MarginGAAP and Adjusted: a range of 20% to 21%Effective Tax RateGAAP: approximately 20%Adjusted: mid-teens rangeEPSGAAP: $2.18 - $2.28Adjusted: $1.75 - $1.852022 Investor DayThe Company will host an investor day on Thursday, October 20, 2022.

A non-GAAP financial measure reflects an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company’s operations that, when viewed with the Company’s GAAP results and the reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measure, provides a more complete understanding of the Company’s business. Users of the financial statements are encouraged to review the Company’s financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included below.2022 Investor Day Reconciliation of Non-GAAP to GAAP Financial MeasuresNotes3Q22Revenues (GAAP)$1,089.6Foreign currency translation impact(a)60.8Revenues, constant currency (non-GAAP)1,150.4Less Business Solutions revenues, constant currency (non-GAAP)(b)(50.4)Revenues, constant currency, excluding Business Solutions (non-GAAP)$1,100.0Prior year revenues (GAAP)$1,286.3Less prior year revenues from Business Solutions (GAAP)(b)(116.8)Prior year revenues, adjusted, excluding Business Solutions$1,169.5Revenues (GAAP) - YoY % Change(15)%Revenues, constant currency (non-GAAP) - YoY% Change(11)%Revenues, constant currency, excluding Business Solutions (non-GAAP) - YoY % Change(6)%Business Solutions Segment MetricsNotes3Q22Revenues (GAAP)$42.6Foreign currency translation impact(a)7.8Revenues, constant currency (non-GAAP)$50.4Prior year revenues (GAAP)$116.8Revenues (GAAP) - YoY % change(63)%Revenues, constant currency (non-GAAP) - YoY % change(57)%THE WESTERN UNION COMPANYNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES(Unaudited)Notes3Q22Operating income (GAAP)$231.8Acquisition and divestiture costs(c)0.4Russia/Belarus exit costs(d)(0.6)Business Solutions exit costs(d)—Operating income, excluding acquisition and divestiture costs, Russia/Belarus exit costs, and Business Solutions exit costs (non-GAAP)$231.6Less Business Solutions operating income(1)(b)(15.6)Operating income, excluding acquisition and divestiture costs, Russia/Belarus exit costs, and Business Solutions operating income and exit costs (non-GAAP)$216.0Operating margin (GAAP)21.3%Operating margin, excluding acquisition and divestiture costs, Russia/Belarus exit costs, and Business Solutions exit costs (non-GAAP)21.2%Operating margin, excluding acquisition and divestiture costs, Russia/Belarus exit costs, and Business Solutions operating income and exit costs (non-GAAP)(1)20.6%___________________________________________________(1) Concurrent with the sale in the first quarter of 2022, the Business Solutions operating income has been excluded.

Constant currency results exclude any benefit or loss caused by foreign exchange fluctuations between foreign currencies and the United States dollar, net of foreign currency hedges, which would not have occurred if there had been a constant exchange rate. The Company believes that this measure provides management and investors with information about revenue results and trends that eliminates currency volatility while increasing the comparability of the Company's underlying results and trends.(b)During 2021, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its Business Solutions business to Goldfinch Partners LLC and The Baupost Group LLC (collectively, the ""Buyer"") for cash consideration of $910.0 million, subject to regulatory and working capital adjustments. The sale will be completed in three closings, the first of which occurred on March 1, 2022 with the entirety of the cash consideration collected at that time and allocated to the closings on a relative fair value basis. The first closing excluded the operations in the European Union and the United Kingdom and resulted in a gain of $151.4 million. The second closing is currently expected to occur on December 1, 2022, and includes the United Kingdom operations. The third closing, which includes the European Union operations, is currently expected in the first quarter of 2023, pending regulatory approvals. Revenues have been adjusted to exclude the carved out financial information for the Business Solutions business to compare the year-over-year changes and trends in the Company's continuing businesses, excluding the effects of this divestiture. While the sale of the Company's Business Solutions business does not qualify for or represent discontinued operations, the Company has also adjusted operating income, beginning in the first quarter of 2022 and concurrent with the sale, to exclude the carved out direct profit of the Business Solutions business. During the period between the first and third closings, the Company will continue to record revenues and operating income for the European Union and United Kingdom operations, but it will pay the Buyer a measure of the profits from these operations, adjusted for other charges, as contractually agreed, and this expense is recognized in Other income/(expense), net. Therefore, the Company believes that providing this information enhances investors' understanding of the profitability of the Company's remaining businesses. The Company has also excluded the gain on the sale, net of related taxes from its first quarter 2022 results and the 2022 adjusted outlook, as management believes that excluding the impact from the gain on sale of the Business Solutions business will provide investors with a clearer and more meaningful comparison of results in 2022 and future periods. These financial measures are non-GAAP measures and should not be considered a substitute for the GAAP measures.(c)Represents the impact from expenses incurred in connection with the Company's acquisition and divestiture activity, including for the review and closing of these transactions. The Company believes that, by excluding the effects of these charges that can impact operating trends, management and investors are provided with a measure that increases the comparability of the Company's underlying operating results.(d)Represents the exit costs incurred in connection with the divestiture of the Business Solutions business and the suspension of operations in Russia and Belarus, primarily related to severance and non-cash impairments of property and equipment, an operating lease right-of-use asset, and other intangible assets. While certain of the expenses are identifiable to the Company's segments, the expenses are not included in the measurement of segment operating income provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker for purposes of performance assessment and resource allocation. These expenses are therefore excluded from the Company's segment operating income results. These expenses have been excluded from operating income, the effective tax rate, and diluted earnings per share, net of related taxes. Additionally, the outlook metrics have been adjusted to exclude these costs, net of related taxes where applicable. The Company believes that, by excluding the effects of these charges that can impact operating trends, management and investors are provided with a measure that increases the comparability of the Company's underlying operating results.(e)Represents non-cash reversals of significant uncertain tax positions. The Company believes excluding these reversals provides a more meaningful comparison of results to the historical periods presented.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221018006332/en/ContactsMedia Relations: Claire Treacymedia@westernunion.comInvestor Relations: Tom HadleyWesternUnion.IR@westernunion.com]"

RTX is set to release third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 25, before market open.Raytheon delivered an earnings surprise of 10.53% in the last four quarters, on average. Growing international travel demand is likely to benefit Q3 results amid lower 787 deliveries and inflationary impacts.Pratt &amp; Whitney and Collins: Key Growth CatalystsThe merger between legacy missile-maker Raytheon Company with multinational conglomerate United Technologies, resulting in the formation of Raytheon Technologies, was completed in April 2021. Consequently, Raytheon Technologies’ third-quarter 2022 results are expected to benefit from the incremental merger synergies.Raytheon Technologies Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseRaytheon Technologies Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseRaytheon Technologies Corporation price-eps-surprise | Raytheon Technologies Corporation QuoteAlso, cost synergies from the acquisition of Rockwell Collins are anticipated to bolster the company’s soon-to-be-reported quarter’s results.Growing international travel demand, thanks to continued recovery in air travel, is likely to have boosted the company’s overall commercial OEM as well as aftermarket sales in the third quarter. This, along with solid growth from Pratt’s commercial engine business as well as higher F-35 aftermarket volume, must have driven the sales growth expectation for both its Pratt &amp; Whitney as well as Collins business units, along with solid acquisition synergies.However, headwinds related to lower deliveries of 787 jets might have partially impacted the performance of these two units in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Pratt &amp; Whitney segment Q3 revenues is pegged at $5,278 million, implying an improvement of 11.7% from the 2021 third-quarter figure. The estimate for Collins Aerospace indicates an increase of 13.2%.Bleak Outlook for Missile and DefenseAlthough growing global budgets have led Raytheon to witness solid order growth in the recent past, ongoing material availability delays and the associated productivity impact might have adversely impacted the Q3 performance of the Raytheon Missiles &amp; Defense segment.Story continuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Missiles &amp; Defense segment Q3 revenues is pegged at $3,887 million, suggesting a slip of 0.4% from the 2021 third-quarter figure.Other Factors to NoteAmid the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, RTX ceased its business activities with Russia, which in turn might hurt Q3 sales. Also, constant supply chain pressure across its business might have had an adverse impact on its overall bottom-line performance.Further, slower-than-expected recovery in material receipts and the resulting impacts on Raytheon’s productivity along with increasing inflationary pressure in labor, freight and other indirect cost areas might have dragged down the company’s Q3 earnings, outweighing sales growth benefits.Q3 ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Raytheon Technologies’ third-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.12 on revenues of $17.11 billion. The earnings and revenue estimates indicate an 11.1% decline and a 5.6% improvement, respectively, from the year-ago quarter’s reported numbers.What Our Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Raytheon Technologies this time around. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for an earnings beat.

This compares to earnings of $1.69 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -0.60%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this paint and coatings maker would post earnings of $1.75 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.81, delivering a surprise of 3.43%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.PPG Industries , which belongs to the Zacks Chemical - Diversified industry, posted revenues of $4.47 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.19%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $4.37 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.PPG Industries shares have lost about 32.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -22%.What's Next for PPG Industries?While PPG Industries has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for PPG Industries: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead.

McGarry, PPG chairman and chief executive officer, commented on the quarter:We achieved record sales in the third quarter driven by continued selling price realization, resulting in more than a 12% increase in selling prices versus the third quarter 2021 and an 18% increase on a two-year stacked basis. However, as we previously communicated, sales volumes were impacted by further softening demand in Europe and less sequential quarterly demand recovery in China than was expected due to a resumption of certain pandemic-related restrictions. These factors, along with worsening foreign currency translation impacts, caused our sales growth to be lower than anticipated at the beginning of the quarter.The higher year-over-year sales were aided by record sales in our PPG Comex and global automotive refinish businesses. In addition, both the aerospace and automotive original equipment manufacturer (OEM) coatings businesses delivered double-digit percentage sales volume gains, though demand in both industries remains well below pre-pandemic levels. Overall supply chain disruptions continued to broadly ease throughout the quarter; however, a few lingering short-supplied raw materials had impacts across several businesses. At quarter-end, the automotive refinish and aerospace coatings businesses continued to have much larger than traditional order backlogs totaling about $200 million.Story continuesLooking ahead, normal seasonal demand trends are anticipated in the fourth quarter. In addition, economic activity is forecasted to remain soft in Europe and China, and demand for architectural do-it-for-yourself (DIY) paint products is likely to continue to weaken on a global basis. Due to the reduced economic activity, an additional cost restructuring program is now underway focused on fast payback actions targeting $70 million of annualized savings upon full implementation. We continue to expect our business portfolio to prove more resilient in the coming quarters as several of our larger businesses, including automotive OEM and aerospace coatings, are anticipated to deliver growth due to large supply deficits and low inventories in these end-use markets. Finally, we expect that our year-over-year operating margins will improve in the fourth quarter and into 2023 as we work to restore our historical margin profile through our actions to fully offset inflation and manage our costs.Lastly, I want to thank our global employees who demonstrate The PPG Way every day by continuing to overcome unexpected challenges to provide our customers across the world with the products and excellent service they rely on.Third Quarter 2022 Reportable Segment Financial ResultsPerformance Coatings segment$ in millions3Q 20223Q 2021Y-O-Y changeNet sales$2,705$2,758-2%Segment income$362$408-11%Segment income %13.4%14.8%Sales volumes-6%Selling prices+11%Divestitures and wind down of Russia-1%Foreign currency translation-6%Performance Coatings net sales decreased due to lower sales volumes, the impact of divestitures, the wind down of business in Russia, and unfavorable foreign currency translation impacts.

Most notably, disruptions continued to impact the automotive refinish and aerospace coatings businesses. As expected, demand for architectural coatings DIY products in Europe remained soft due to decreased consumer confidence and customer inventory destocking stemming from current geopolitical issues. Sales volumes in the U.S. architectural coatings business were also impacted by weaker DIY demand, which offset positive trends related to our recently announced expanded relationship with The Home Depot® in the professional paint channel. Automotive refinish coatings organic sales grew by a mid-single-digit percentage driven by higher selling prices that were partially offset by lower sales volumes, most notably in China due to COVID-19 restrictions. Aerospace sales volumes were up more than 10% compared to third quarter 2021 as aftermarket demand continued to recover and commercial new build activity began to improve. Traffic solutions delivered organic sales growth of more than 10% compared to the prior year. Organic sales in the protective and marine coatings business grew by a low-single-digit percentage despite COVID-19 restrictions in China negatively impacting sales volumes.Segment income was lower than the prior year mainly due to raw material, logistics, and labor cost inflation, the impact of lower sales volumes, unfavorable currency translation and increased manufacturing costs, partially offset by higher selling prices coupled with restructuring cost savings. Unfavorable foreign currency translation negatively impacted segment earnings by nearly $25 million.Industrial Coatings segment$ in millions3Q 20223Q 2021Y-O-Y changeNet sales$1,763$1,614+9%Segment income$192$140+37%Segment income %10.9%8.7%Sales volumes+2%Selling prices+14%Divestitures and wind down of Russia-1%Foreign currency translation-6%Industrial Coatings net sales increased due to higher selling prices across all businesses and increased sales volumes, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation and the wind down of business in Russia. Automotive OEM coatings organic sales were up more than 20% due to higher selling prices and sales volumes, including record sales in Asia Pacific reflecting the company’s strong position in this region and robust retail sales in China. Automotive OEM customer production outages due to component shortages continued to impact sales in the U.S. and Europe, but moderated year-over-year. Industrial coatings organic sales were up a high single-digit percentage driven by strong selling price realization, partially offset by lower sales volumes in Europe and China due to softer industrial production activity. Packaging coatings delivered organic sales growth of about 10% led by higher selling prices and continued U.S. sales volume strength.Segment income was higher than the prior year by $52 million mainly due to higher selling prices and improving sales volumes, partially offset by increased raw material and energy costs and foreign currency translation. Segment margins improved on a sequential quarterly basis compared to the second quarter 2022.Additional Financial InformationAt quarter end, the company had cash and short-term investments totaling about $1.1 billion. Net debt was $5.7 billion, about $400 million lower than the end of the second quarter 2022. Inventories declined in comparison to the second quarter and the company remains focused on further reductions in the fourth quarter, including destocking higher-than-normal raw material inventories.Corporate expenses were about $60 million in the third quarter.Acquisition-related synergies and business restructuring programs delivered about $25 million of cost savings.The company’s reported and adjusted effective tax rates for the third quarter were about 19% and 20%, respectively.OutlookThe company today reported the following projections for the fourth quarter 2022 based on current global economic activity and in consideration of the near-term economic uncertainty associated with the impact of geopolitical issues in Europe and the continuing pandemic:Aggregate sales volumes down a mid-single-digit percentage year over yearCorporate expenses of between $55 million and $60 millionNet interest expense of between $35 million and $40 millionEffective tax rate of about 20%Reported EPS of $0.90 to $1.05Adjusted EPS of $1.05 to $1.20, excluding amortization expense of $0.13 and costs related to previously approved and communicated business restructuring of $0.02.A detailed commentary and associated presentation slides related to the third quarter financial information is posted on the company’s investor relations website.The term organic sales as used in this press release is defined as net sales excluding the impact of currency, divestitures, and the wind down of Russia operations.PPG: WE PROTECT AND BEAUTIFY THE WORLD®At PPG (NYSE:PPG), we work every day to develop and deliver the paints, coatings and specialty materials that our customers have trusted for nearly 140 years.

These matters within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, involve risks and uncertainties that may affect PPG’s operations, as discussed in the company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Sections 13(a), 13(c) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Accordingly, many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained herein. Such factors include statements related to the expected effects on our business of COVID-19, global economic conditions, geopolitical issues in Europe, the amount of future share repurchases, increasing price and product competition by our competitors, fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials, energy, labor and logistics, the ability to achieve selling price increases, the ability to recover margins, customer inventory levels, PPG inventory levels, the ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements, the timing of realization of anticipated cost savings from restructuring and other initiatives, the ability to identify additional cost savings opportunities, the timing and expected benefits of potential future and completed acquisitions, difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and achieving expected synergies therefrom, economic and political conditions in international markets, the ability to penetrate existing, developing and emerging foreign and domestic markets, foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in such rates, fluctuations in tax rates, the impact of future legislation, the impact of environmental regulations, unexpected business disruptions, the unpredictability of existing and possible future litigation, including asbestos litigation, and governmental investigations. However, it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, while the list of factors presented here and in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K and June 30, 2022 Form 10-Q are considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward-looking statements. Consequences of material differences in results compared with those anticipated in the forward-looking statements could include, among other things, lower sales or earnings, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability to third parties and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on PPG’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.All information in this release speaks only as of October 19, 2022, and any distribution of this release after that date is not intended and will not be construed as updating or confirming such information. PPG undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, except as otherwise required by applicable law.Regulation G ReconciliationPPG believes investors’ understanding of the company’s performance is enhanced by the disclosure of net income, earnings per diluted share from continuing operations and PPG’s effective tax rate adjusted for certain items. PPG’s management considers this information useful in providing insight into the company’s ongoing performance because it excludes the impact of items that cannot reasonably be expected to recur on a quarterly basis or that are not attributable to our primary operations. Net income, earnings per diluted share from continuing operations and the effective tax rate adjusted for these items are not recognized financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""U.S. GAAP"") and should not be considered a substitute for net income, earnings per diluted share, the effective tax rate or other financial measures as computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per diluted share and the adjusted effective tax rate may not be comparable to similarly titled measures as reported by other companies.Regulation G Reconciliation - Net Income and Earnings per Diluted Share($ in millions, except per-share amounts)Third Quarter2022Third Quarter2021$EPS(a)$EPS(a)Reported net income from continuing operations$329$1.39$344$1.43Acquisition-related amortization expense300.13350.15Business restructuring-related costs, net(b)340.14(18)(0.08)Transaction-related costs(c)——330.14Impairment and other related charges, net(d)——120.05Adjusted net income from continuing operations, excluding certain items$393$1.66$406$1.69Third Quarter2022Third Quarter2021IncomeBeforeIncomeTaxesIncomeTaxExpenseEffectiveTax RateIncomeBeforeIncomeTaxesIncomeTaxExpenseEffectiveTax RateEffective tax rate, continuing operations$418$7918.9%$441$9621.8%Acquisition-related amortization expense401024.6%461124.6%Business restructuring-related costs, net(b)451125.4%(25)(7)29.9%Transaction-related costs(c)———%431024.9%Impairment and other related charges, net(d)———%21629.2%Adjusted effective tax rate, continuing operations, excluding certain items$503$10019.9%$526$11622.1%(a)Earnings per diluted share is calculated based on unrounded numbers.

110,3fdbb288-1cdb-3706-bde1-65f368c620c9,GS,2022-10-20,Is Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta World Low Vol Plus Equity ETF (GLOV) a Strong ETF Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-activebeta-world-low-102010119.html,1666261210,STORY,"['GS', 'GSBD']","[A smart beta exchange traded fund, the Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta World Low Vol Plus Equity ETF (GLOV) debuted on 03/15/2022, and offers broad exposure to the Broad Developed World ETFs category of the market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?Products that are based on market cap weighted indexes, which are strategies designed to reflect a specific market segment or the market as a whole, have traditionally dominated the ETF industry.Because market cap weighted indexes provide a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, they work well for investors who believe in market efficiency.There are some investors, though, who think it's possible to beat the market with great stock selection; this group likely invests in another class of funds known as smart beta, which track non-cap weighted strategies.Based on specific fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such, these indexes attempt to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance.This area offers many different investment choices, such as simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies; however, not all of these strategies can deliver superior results.Fund Sponsor &amp; IndexThe fund is managed by Goldman Sachs Funds. GLOV has been able to amass assets over $528.21 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Broad Developed World ETFs. Before fees and expenses, this particular fund seeks to match the performance of the GOLDMAN SACHS ACTBT WORLD LW VL PL EQ ID.The Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta World Low Vol Plus Equity Index delivers exposure to large and mid-capitalization equity securities of developed market issuers, including the United States.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long-term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins, other things remaining the same.Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.25% for this ETF, which makes it one of the cheaper products in the space.Story continuesThe fund has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.30%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsMost ETFs are very transparent products, and disclose their holdings on a daily basis. ETFs also offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, though it's still important for investors to research a fund's holdings.Taking into account individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 2.95% of the fund's total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and Oreilly Automotive Inc (ORLY).The top 10 holdings account for about 14.13% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskYear-to-date, the Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta World Low Vol Plus Equity ETF has lost about -13.98% so far. GLOV has traded between $34.82 and $42.88 in this past 52-week period.With about 389 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesGoldman Sachs ActiveBeta World Low Vol Plus Equity ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Broad Developed World ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.IShares MSCI ACWI ETF (ACWI) tracks MSCI All Country World Index and the Vanguard Total World Stock ETF (VT) tracks FTSE Global All Cap Index. IShares MSCI ACWI ETF has $14.67 billion in assets, Vanguard Total World Stock ETF has $20.88 billion. ACWI has an expense ratio of 0.32% and VT charges 0.07%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Broad Developed World ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Today it’s about 65%, so we’re kind of operating close to the way we were,” said CEO David Solomon in an interview with CNBC’s Squawk &lt;em&gt;Box&lt;/em&gt; on Tuesday.That’s a major improvement over February when it reopened its U.S. offices following the Omicron wave and just half of the 10,000 workers at its New York headquarters returned.The head of Goldman feels strongly that the bank would lose its identity over time as analysts and associates learning from veterans are a key factor to its long-standing success.“If you break that all down and scatter it around…you start to fray the foundational things that make the place so unique,” Solomon told Fortune in March. “For Goldman Sachs to retain that cultural foundation, we have to bring people together.”Competitors and industry experts agree.In Fortune’s latest list of the World’s Most Admired Companies, the voters who determine the rankings—top industry executives and directors, plus stock analysts who follow particular sectors—rated Goldman No. 1 in people management in its industry, ahead of JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Citigroup, HSBC, and more.Flexibility when you’re olderSolomon argues the need for a return to the office is explicitly due to the very young age and lack of experience found in many of its ultracompetitive workforce.Story continues“We have an organization where 50% of people are in their twenties. They come to Goldman Sachs to learn, to meet people, to interact,” he told CNBC.The bulk of them typically leave the bank within the first couple of years, so it is only when those employees reach their thirties and forties that there are higher degrees of flexibility, for example, to look after kids.“I don’t want rules,” continued Solomon. “I want a culture where we show up, serve our clients.”Solomon said that meant mentoring his people so they work hard and strive for excellence.His comments are not unlike those of Elon Musk, one of the rare CEOs out of Silicon Valley who insists on a blanket rule for all workers to be in the office, fearing otherwise their productivity won’t meet his high demands.The world’s richest human has said anyone who doesn’t come to the office “should pretend to work somewhere else.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: The economist who just won the Nobel Prize warns the Fed will cause ‘all kinds of trouble’Microsoft’s remote-work-friendly CEO puts his finger on the big problem with working from homeGen Z activists who dumped 2 cans of tomato soup on Van Gogh’s ‘Sunflowers’ plead not guilty in courtSouth Korea stands to lose billions from making K-pop superstars BTS do military service]"

(NYSE:GS) insiders, selling US$18m worth of stock earlier this year was a smart move.",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-group-inc-nyse-140012882.html,1666188012,STORY,"['GS', 'GSBD']","[The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.'s (NYSE:GS) stock rose 6.7% last week, but insiders who sold US$18m worth of stock over the last year are probably in a more advantageous position. Holding on to stock would have meant their investment would be worth less now than it was at the time of sale. Thus selling at an average price of US$380, which is higher than the current price, may have been the best decision.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group Goldman Sachs Group Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Non-Executive Director, David Viniar, sold US$7.0m worth of shares at a price of US$411 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$314. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.In the last year Goldman Sachs Group insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At Goldman Sachs Group Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Goldman Sachs Group. In total, Global Treasurer Philip Berlinski sold US$2.8m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesDoes Goldman Sachs Group Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Goldman Sachs Group insiders own about US$522m worth of shares (which is 0.5% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Goldman Sachs Group Insiders?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Goldman Sachs Group you should know about.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

MAT is scheduled to report its third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 25, after the closing bell. In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 260%.Q3 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at 73 cents compared with 84 cents reported in the prior-year quarter. In the past seven days, earnings estimates for the current quarter have witnessed downward revisions by a penny. The consensus mark for revenues stands at $1.75 billion, suggesting a decline of 0.8% from the prior-year quarter.Factors to NoteThe company’s third-quarter performance might have been hurt by a decline in sales of Power Brands Barbie. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for Power Brands Barbie is pegged at $545 million, suggesting an improvement of 1.8% from the prior-year quarter. Cost inflation may have negatively impacted the company’s operations due to a rise in raw materials and ocean freight, which in turn may have weighed on the company’s bottom line in the quarter to be reported.However, robust North American sales and strong demand for its products are likely to aid the company’s results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for North America revenues stands at $1,128 million, indicating an improvement of 1.6% year over year. Increase in the sales of Action Figures, Building Sets, Games, and Other (including Jurassic World and Lightyear), Vehicles (including Hot Wheels), Infant, Toddler, and Preschool (including Fisher-Price and Thomas &amp; Friends) and Dolls (including Polly Pocket and Barbie) may have contributed to North America revenues.The consensus mark for worldwide gross revenues for Thomas &amp; Friends Brand stands at $389 million, indicating growth of 1.3% year over year.

He further mentioned that dividend yields contributed significantly to such returns.The past performance of the stock market during bear markets shows that high-dividend stocks have outperformed their peers in nearly every market downturn. Moreover, reinvestment plans also make dividend stocks more reliable relative to other securities. Companies with strong dividend growth cycles allow shareholders with reinvestment plans to increase the value of their investments. According to Charles Schwab’s research, reinvesting dividends can significantly boost shareholders’ initial investment. Another report by the same financial services company shows that dividend securities surpassed the overall market in six out of seven bear markets from 1976 to 2022.

Let’s take a deeper dive into the company’s recent quarterly print.Netflix Q3It was a much better-than-expected quarter for Netflix – revenue, operating income, and membership exceeded the company’s initial forecast, undoubtedly a major highlight.Netflix reported quarterly earnings of $3.10 per share, handily beating the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $2.11 by a double-digit 47%.The company generated $7.9 billion in revenue throughout the quarter, edging out the Zacks Consensus Sales Estimate by 1%.Following back-to-back quarters of subscriber losses, Netflix provided investors with much-needed positive news; NFLX added roughly 2.4 million net new paid subscribers, more than double the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 1.1 million, bringing the overall subscriber count to approximately 223.1 million.Further, the company’s lower-priced ad-supported plan is slated to be deployed in 12 countries in November, a massive step for the company.Netflix has been pushing the idea of an ad-supported tier for some time now, looking to add more ways to generate revenue. Netflix stated, “The reaction from advertisers so far has been extremely positive and we believe that more choice, especially for more price conscious consumers, will translate into meaningful incremental revenue and operating profit over time. That said, it’s still very early days and, since we’re keeping our existing plans ad-free, it will take us time to build up our membership base and the associated ad revenue.”Story continuesNFLX previously announced that Microsoft will be its technology and sales partner for its advertising venture.Additionally, Netflix has been undergoing a multi-year evolution of its content model; the company has been transforming its service from licensed second-run content to mostly Netflix originals.The evolution of its content model has proven successful; the streaming giant’s Q3 content portfolio was strong, with Stranger Things Season 4 generating roughly 1.4 billion hours viewed, NFLX’s biggest season of an English language series in its history.Netflix’s limited series, Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story, was also a significant hit, with it now being the second-largest English series in the company’s history with 824 million hours watched.Clearly, it was a strong quarter for the company, with two of its Q3 releases becoming their first and second most-watched English series of all time.The company also provided an optimistic view for its Q4 – it forecasts net new paid subscribers adds of a strong 4.5 million, and average revenue per membership (ARM) is expected to grow 6% Y/Y.Big CompetitionOne of Netflix’s biggest competitors is undoubtedly Disney with its Disney+ service.In fact, the Disney+ subscriber base actually overtook Netflix’s earlier in the year, with 221.1 million subscribers reported vs. Netflix’s roughly 220.7 million.With Netflix now reporting a subscriber base of 223.1 million in Q3, it’s taken back the throne.NFLX holding the title remains valid until Disney reports its Q4 results on November 11th.Disney+ has been growing at an unbelievable pace; the service added 14.4 million subscribers in its latest quarter.Further, DIS also plans to release an ad-supported tier for Disney+, slated to roll out on December 8th of this year, roughly a month after Netflix’s proposed initial rollout.Analysts have been bearish for the upcoming quarter, with four estimate revisions hitting the tape over the last several months. Still, the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $0.60 for DIS reflects a stellar 62% Y/Y uptick in earnings.With Netflix posting a better-than-expected quarter, it seems valid to question Disney’s upcoming quarterly results. The success that Disney+ has displayed has been remarkable, quickly catching up to Netflix. With seemingly no signs of subscriber slowdown, Disney+ can easily take back the top streaming position if it posts a strong quarter.This back-and-forth war between the two streaming titans will play out right before our eyes.Bottom LineNetflix shares have been the victim of a deep sell-off in 2022 thanks to a subscriber slowdown being a thorn in the company’s side.However, buyers have stepped up visibly for NFLX shares over the last three months, driving shares for a stellar run. Following the company’s better-than-expected Q3, shares skyrocketed in after-hours trading.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

The platform delivered a beat on both the top and bottom lines, in addition to 2.41 million net subscriber additions — crushing estimates of 1 million.""This company is clearly back on track,"" Geetha Ranganathan, senior media analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, told Yahoo Finance Live as analysts begin to separate themselves into optimistic and not so optimistic buckets.Following the strong results, Guggenheim's Michael Morris maintained his Buy rating, upping his price target by $40 to $305, while Wedbush Securities' Michael Pachter raised his price target to $325 (up from $280), citing ""higher free cash flow expectations.""Evercore ISI's Mark Mahaney raised his price target by $40 to $340 and reiterated his Outperform rating. In a note to clients, the analyst wrote, ""Netflix fundamentals have stabilized, and now comes the biggest catalyst across consumer internet – the launch of Netflix’s ad-supported offering in November.""This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Will ad-supported be the answer? Wall Street's splitDespite concerns that current subscribers will trade down to the ad-supported version, Citi Managing Director Jason Bazinet told Yahoo Finance Live that he views the introduction of advertising as a lucrative revenue driver.""It's not a spin down risk, it's a spin up opportunity,"" the analyst maintained, surmising that the company could secure $10 or more in advertising revenue per ad-tier subscriber in the U.S.Ranganathan agreed that ad-supported will be a strong future catalyst, explaining that the upcoming tier is ""competitively"" priced at $6.99 a month in the U.S.Dave Heger, senior equity analyst at Edward Jones, added that ""the ad-supported service should help drive subscriber growth in international markets"" — a particularly salient point amid the strengthening U.S. dollar.Story continues""The lower price point will be attractive in certain markets overseas — there's more ability to pay at that lower price point,"" he said, surmising that advertising revenue will help offset lower price points and, in turn, also offset foreign exchange (FX) pressures.Netflix lowered its forward guidance, specifically citing FX challenges as the U.S. dollar continues to gain momentum against most major currencies.""Based on our YTD actuals and Q4 guidance, we estimate that this appreciation since January 1, 2022 will negatively impact our full year 2022 revenue and operating income by ~$1 billion and $0.8 billion, respectively,"" the company stated in its earnings release.But not everyone on Wall Street is convinced.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Bank of America reiterated its Underperform rating and $196 price target, writing in a note to clients that Netflix's ""ad-tier is hard to understand as a growth driver, particularly with lower cost per thousand impressions (CPMs) outside of English speaking markets.""""We still are not able to square a compelling international breakeven, and are unsure of the value proposition to consumers given high-CPM countries are nearly fully penetrated,"" the note continued, adding that FX headwinds, content cyclicality, and long-term challenges still remain.Similarly, CFRA analyst Kenneth Leon, despite raising his price target on the stock by $10 to $225 a share, maintained his Sell rating, writing that shares are currently ""overvalued.""""Netflix is not a growth company ... It is as a slow growing media company with single-digit revenue growth and intense competition,"" the analyst wrote in a note to clients, adding that any material impact from the platform's upcoming ad-supported tier will not be realized until the second half of 2023.Macquarie analyst Tim Nollen, who maintains a Neutral rating on the stock, said he expects fourth-quarter earnings and revenue to be dragged down by FX and content costs.He added that although he is optimistic on growth from the ad-tier, as well as efforts to reduce password sharing, those revenue streams will take time to translate to meaningful upside. As a result, Nollen estimates only modest EBITDA upside in 2023.The ""Stranger Things"" cast pose together at the season four premiere at Netflix Studios Brooklyn on Saturday, May 14, 2022, in New York. (Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP)Content winsTuesday's earnings marked the first time this year the company has added subscribers, which mostly came from outside of the United StatesIn the first and second quarters, Netflix lost 200,000 and 970,000 subscribers, respectively. The company said it will stop giving guidance on paid memberships moving forward due to its introduction of new revenue streams. For now, though, it estimated an addition of 4.5 million subscribers next quarter (above prior forecasts of 3.9 million.)Netflix attributed its success in the quarter to several TV and film hits, including ""Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story,"" ""Stranger Things S4,"" ""Extraordinary Attorney Woo,"" ""The Gray Man,"" and ""Purple Hearts.""On the earnings call, Netflix Co-CEO Ted Sarandos said the company, which has committed to spend $17 billion on content in 2022, is working to get ""better and better"" at securing ""more impact per $1 billion spend than anybody else.""""That's how we're focusing on it — we're spending at about the right level,"" the executive maintained.Netflix underscored its streaming prowess relative to competitors, writing in its earnings release, ""Our competitors are investing heavily to drive subscribers and engagement, but building a large, successful streaming business is hard — we estimate they are all losing money, with combined 2022 operating losses well over $10 billion, vs. Netflix's $5 to $6 billion annual operating profit.""Bloomberg's Ranganathan noted that, as competitors ease up on spending amid greater focus on profitability, Netflix should come out on top.""I think that really gives Netflix a leg up as they try and get more and more bang for their buck,"" Ranganathan said, adding that increased engagement will also be especially useful for advertisers.Alexandra is a Senior Media and Entertainment Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Energy was the sole S&amp;P sector to end the session in positive territory with a gain of 2.94%.Abbott Laboratories tumbled 6.5% after reporting lower-than-expected growth in international medical device sales, hit by a strong dollar and supply challenges in China.Netflix shares, however, jumped 13.1% as the best perfomer operformerP 500 after it attracted 2.4 million new subscribers worldwide in the third quarter, more than double the consensus forecast, and guided for 4.5 million additions by year-end.""The bonds are just weighing so heavily on it ... it’s a shame to see good earnings be wasted,"" said JJ Kinahan, CEO of IG North America in Chicago.""Ultimately earnings drives stocks but when they are being overshadowed it is tough to have that optimism, but ultimately good earnings will lead to stocks going higher, it is a matter of how much the macroeconomic picture is going to continue to hurt those earnings.""Story continuesThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 99.99 points, or 0.33%, to 30,423.81, the S&amp;P 500 lost 24.82 points, or 0.67%, to 3,695.16 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 91.89 points, or 0.85%, to 10,680.51.Fed officials have largely been in sync in their public comments about the need to be aggressive in raising rates to tackle inflation. On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari said job market demand remains strong and underlying inflation pressures probably have not peaked yet.The Fed's ""Beige Book"" survey of economic activity showed firms noted price pressures remained elevated, although there was some easing in several districts, while the labor market showed some signs of cooling.The U.S. central bank is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points for the fourth straight time at its November meeting.The Fed's effect on the housing market continues to grow. Housing starts, a measure of new residential construction, dropped 8.1% in September in the latest sign of the economy losing steam.The PHLX Housing Index stumbled -4.50%, marking another sector unlikely to help stocks reverse months of declines, with the three main U.S. indexes still mired in bear markets.Dow components Procter &amp; Gamble Co gained 0.93% and Travelers Companies Inc rose 4.44% after the companies posted better-than expected quarterly profit.Third-quarter profit growth expectations for S&amp;P 500 companies have edged up to 3% from 2.8% on Tuesday, according to Refinitiv data, still well below the 11.1% increase forecast at the start of July.Tesla Inc advanced 0.84% ahead of its earnings after the bell, with focus on any weakness in demand that is starting to weigh on the auto industry. Shares dropped 3.94% following the close as the electric vehicle maker missed revenue estimates for the third quarter.Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.05 billion shares, compared with the 11.62 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.28-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.69-to-1 ratio favored decliners.The S&amp;P 500 posted 2 new 52-week highs and 9 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 42 new highs and 232 new lows.(Reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak in New York Editing by Matthew Lewis)]"

People are living longer, so that money has to cover a longer period. Making matters worse, income generated using tried-and-true retirement planning approaches may not cover expenses these days. That means seniors must dip into principal to meet living expenses.In today's economic environment, traditional income investments are not working.For example, 10-year Treasury bonds in the late 1990s offered a yield of around 6.50%, which translated to an income source you could count on. However, today's yield is much lower and probably not a viable return option to fund typical retirements.The impact of this rate decline is sizable: over 20 years, the difference in yield for a $1 million investment in 10-year Treasuries is more than $1 million.In addition to the considerable drop in bond yields, today's retirees are nervous about their future Social Security benefits. Because of certain demographic factors, it's been estimated that the funds that pay the Social Security benefits will run out of money in 2035.So what's a retiree to do? You could cut your expenses to the bone, and take the risk that your Social Security checks don't shrink. Or you could find an alternative investment that provides a steady, higher-rate income stream to replace dwindling bond yields.Invest in Dividend StocksDividend-paying stocks from low-risk, high-quality companies are a smart way to generate steady and reliable attractive income streams to replace low risk, low yielding Treasury and bond options.Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.Going beyond those familiar names, you can find excellent dividend-paying stocks by following a few guidelines. Look for companies that pay a dividend yield of around 3%, with positive annual dividend growth. The growth rate is key to help combat the effects of inflation.Story continuesHere are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.Conagra Brands (CAG) is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.33 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.78%. This compares to the Food - Miscellaneous industry's yield of 0% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.77%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 5.6%. Check Conagra Brands (CAG) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Pfizer (PFE) is paying out a dividend of $0.4 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.63% compared to the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry's yield of 2.76% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 2.56% over the past year. Check Pfizer (PFE) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $0.97 per share, Phillips 66 (PSX) has a dividend yield of 4.04%. This is compared to the Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry's yield of 1.7% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 7.78%. Check Phillips 66 (PSX) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?It is true that stocks, as an asset class, carry more risk than bonds, but high-quality dividend stocks not only have the ability to produce income growth over time but more importantly, can also reduce your overall portfolio volatility relative to the broader stock market.An upside to adding dividend stocks to your retirement portfolio: they can help lessen the effects of inflation, since many dividend-paying companies (especially blue chip stocks) generally increase their dividends over time.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.If you prefer investing in funds or ETFs compared to individual stocks, you can still pursue a dividend income strategy. However, it's important to know the fees charged by each fund or ETF, which can ultimately reduce your dividend income, working against your strategy. Do your homework and make sure you know the fees charged by any fund before you invest.Bottom LineWhether you select high-quality, low-fee funds or stocks, seeking the steady income of dividend-paying equities can potentially offer you a path to a better and more stress-free retirement.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The division responsible for manufacturing over-the-counter (OTC) drugs could gain the attention of leading private equity firms and other consumer healthcare companies that are interested in creating synergies and experiencing growth in the region.

At the company level, we hold select companies in pharmaceuticals, healthcare services and health insurance at attractive valuations. This is at a time when the average age of the U.S. population is fast approaching 40, older than Asia-Pacific and a little younger than the aged populations of Europe and Japan. The number of seniors in the U.S.—i.e., 65 years or older— now surpasses 54 million, or about 15% of the population. Seniors, on average, take a much greater number of medications and account for a large and disproportionate share of healthcare spending, and we expect that trend to continue due to both raw demographics and a proliferation in the number of available treatments and services available now, the latter being driven by innovation and investment in the healthcare industry. Representative holdings in the Fund include Cigna, United Health Group, Viatris and Quest Diagnostics.”9. Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 54Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) is a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotechnology company that is focused on finding treatments for neurological diseases.On October 12, Paul Matteis at Stifel upgraded Biogen Inc.

Biogen Inc.’s (NASDAQ:BIIB) share price has been on an upward trend following the disclosure of the positive data for lecanemab, with very few concerns related to competitive and commercial risks. The analyst thinks that the risk and reward profile of Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) stock is skewed towards the reward side.Longleaf Partners Fund shared its stance on Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB)  in its Q4 2021 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“Biogen (83%, 2.43%; 5%, 0.10%), a biotechnology company specializing in therapies for the treatment of neurological diseases, was a strong contributor before we exited the position in the first half. We began acquiring shares in January 2021, paying between 9- 11x FCF and a discount to our appraisal, even if the company’s promising drug pipeline turned out to be worth 0. After Biogen’s Alzheimer drug Aduhelm was approved in June, we quickly sold out after the stock’s price appreciated over 70% and briefly exceeded our appraisal of the value. We re-initiated a position in Biogen in December at a price below our original cost basis from January. The stock became very cheap once again after Aduhelm’s early sales disappointed due to its high initial cost before management correctly cut the price. We think Biogen’s core Multiple sclerosis (MS) and Biosimilars businesses are strong enough to create sustainable double-digit EPS growth, even if Aduhelm and the entire Alzheimer’s program is worth zero. We also expect a board led by large shareholders to continue the company’s accretive repurchase, while considering other beneficial corporate actions.”8. Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) is a Thousand Oaks, California-based biotechnology company.On October 11, Matthew Harrison at Morgan Stanley upgraded Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) stock from an Equal Weight to an Overweight rating and also increased the target price from $279 to $257. Given the potential of the medium-term drug pipeline of the company, the analyst thinks Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) is amongst the best pharmaceutical stocks to invest in. Harrison believes that in the current macroeconomic environment, Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) offers a defensive positioning with an attractive long-term upside potential based on the outlook of the AMG133 for obesity care and the launch of biosimilar Amjevita.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Aristotle Capital Management shared its insights on Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN). Here’s what the firm said:“Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN), the pharmaceutical company focused on biotechnology-based therapeutics, was also a top contributor for the quarter. The company reported solid results, with a variety of products, such as bone-strengthening drugs Prolia and EVENITY, contributing to overall revenue growth. Amgen continued to increase the market share for cholesterol drug Repatha (a catalyst we had originally identified), delivering record quarterly sales as the drug’s usage expands with high-risk patients who have not yet had a cardiovascular event, and as barriers for prescribers, healthcare systems and patients are removed. In addition, we believe the company is poised to gain market share with its biosimilars (akin to generic versions of biologic drugs), also a previously identified catalyst. Biosimilars accounted for over $2 billion in revenue in 2021, and we believe this has the potential to more than double by the end of the decade, accelerated by six additional biosimilars (for a total of 11 products on the market). This includes the upcoming launch in the U.S. of arthritis treatment Amjetiva in January 2023. Meanwhile, the company is advancing its robust pipeline of early- and late-stage assets, with several phase III results due this year. These developments have caused us to remain enthusiastic about Amgen’s ability to build on its decades of success developing novel treatments using biopharmaceuticals.”7. Gilead Sciences, Inc.

(NASDAQ:GILD) is a Foster City, California-based pharmaceutical company focused on developing antiviral drugs.Chris Schott at JPMorgan upgraded Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) stock from a Neutral to an Overweight rating on October 4. The analyst also increased the target price from $72 to $80.

The analyst elaborated that the current market capitalization of Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) only covers the value of the HIV business. The company’s oncology division is expected to post annual sales of $5 billion by the end of this decade.Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) offers an annual forward dividend yield of 5.63% as of October 17. The company’s strong growth prospects have led many to see its as one of the best pharmaceutical stocks to invest in.Of the 895 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database, Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) was held by 58 hedge funds as of Q2 2022.6. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) is a New York-based biopharmaceutical company that has seen a significant surge in revenue and earnings following the acquisition of cancer specialist Celgene and cardiology company MyoKardia. The company has also been focusing on internal operations to expand its drug portfolio.Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) holds a leading position in the field of oncology and works actively to enhance its presence in the fields of cardiovascular and immunological diseases. Experts believe that the company’s clinical and regulatory execution has been solid this year as it received approval for multiple drugs, namely Camzyos, Opdualag, and Sotyktu. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) is investing heavily in research and development for its Phase- III trials. Analysts think Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) is amongst the best pharmaceutical stocks as the stock offers considerable upside in the long run.Here’s what Baron Funds said about Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“We established a position in Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, a global biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing, and selling medicines for patients in the therapeutic areas of oncology, immunology, cardiovascular, and neurology. The stock trades at a low valuation relative to its current earnings because the company faces loss of exclusivity on several key drugs over the next eight years, including Revlimid, Eliquis, and Opdivo.At the same time, Bristol-Myers has multiple new products in the early stages of launch (e.g., Opdualag, Camzyos, Breyanzi, and Reblozyl), a robust new product pipeline (e.g., Deucravacitinib, Milvexian, and CELMoD agents), and a strong balance sheet combined with strong free cash flow generation that the company can use for acquisitions. Management believes these growth drivers can more than offset the loss of exclusivity and drive revenue growth through the end of the decade. Given the company’s low valuation, if the company can execute, we think there is substantial upside in the stock.”In addition to Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY), companies like Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) are among the best pharmaceutical stocks in the industry. Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Drug Stocks to Buy Now. Suggested Articles:15 Best Gambling Stocks To BuyBest Asian Stocks To Buy11 Best Big Data Stocks To Invest InDisclose.

Although prices were relatively low, insiders chose to sell US$5.1m worth of stock in the past 12 months. This could be a sign of impending weakness.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for General Dynamics General Dynamics Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Senior VP, Gregory Gallopoulos, sold US$2.5m worth of shares at a price of US$228 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$239, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. It is worth noting that this sale was only 8.0% of Gregory Gallopoulos's holding. The only individual insider seller over the last year was Gregory Gallopoulos.Gregory Gallopoulos divested 21.77k shares over the last 12 months at an average price of US$233. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At General Dynamics Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at General Dynamics. In total, Senior VP Gregory Gallopoulos dumped US$2.5m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesInsider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that General Dynamics insiders own 6.3% of the company, worth about US$4.1b. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About General Dynamics Insiders?An insider sold General Dynamics shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. On the plus side, General Dynamics makes money, and is growing profits. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 26, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis defense contractor is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.16 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +2.9%.Revenues are expected to be $9.93 billion, up 3.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.22% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for General Dynamics?For General Dynamics, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.61%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that General Dynamics will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that General Dynamics would post earnings of $2.72 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.75, delivering a surprise of +1.10%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.General Dynamics doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

These vessels have become the market standard for gas needs of up to 10 bcm, as they are quicker to set up and can change locations, Ruggeri said.Onshore LNG terminals, now normally used for larger needs, take at least three years to be built and Europe's rush to replace Russian gas with alternative supplies, including LNG, has exposed an acute shortage of processing facilities.Story continuesSHORTFALLThe CEO of energy group Eni Claudio Descalzi has warned that, without a new LNG terminal, Italy could face a gas shortfall of 5-6 billion cubic metres, nearly 8% of its annual consumption, in the winter of 2023-24.The new terminal will help refill the country's storage system that will run almost empty by the end of this winter and shore up Italy's energy security, Descalzi said.Think tank ECCO acknowledges the new LNG terminal is a quick fix that will help over the next winter or two but says it is a ""foolish"" investment, further tying Italy to an ""old"" energy source.""It's eventually the most expensive choice, increasing the debt burden on new generations,"" said Michele Governatori of ECCO. Rather than spend on infrastructure that risks becoming obsolete given Europe's shifts toward renewable energy, the government could offer incentives to cut energy use and further develop green projects, Governatori said.With little domestic gas production and a ban on nuclear power generation, Italy heavily relies on imports for its energy needs. Last year, before the Ukraine war, Russian gas covered 38% of its total consumption.Rome has been quick in securing alternative supplies, but with pipeline deliveries of Azeri and Algerian gas already at their limits, it needs LNG to fully replace Russian imports.Italy has focused on its decades-long relationships with Africa and as a result of efforts of state-controlled Eni it expects additional LNG imports for more than 8 bcm by next winter, two sources said.The supplies, mainly from African nations, including Algeria, Angola, Congo Republic, Egypt and Mozambique as well as Qatar and the United States, are due to reach over 10 bcm in the 2024-2025, they said.Since new volumes cannot fit in Italy's three existing LNG terminals, Piombino, a second newly-acquired FRSU that Snam plans to set up in 2024 and an already planned ramp-up of one of the existing terminals will have to absorb the new flows.NEARLY A MIRACLEPiombino's port, which links the mainland with the Elba island, a popular holiday destination, will allow an easy transport of gas to the densely populated and industrialised north of Italy.Its mayor, a member of Meloni's party, has led local protest against the project, stressing risks for safety, environment and local businesses, including fish-farming.However Draghi's government has appointed a special commissioner and granted him sweeping powers that will allow the project to proceed even if challenged in court.The commissioner, Tuscany president Eugenio Giani, is holding talks with Snam, local authorities, the National health institute and other bodies to address specific concerns.Some local and environmental grassroots associations and unions gathered in Piombino on Thursday for a rally against the project.Snam says it will need a final go-ahead from him by end-October to meet the end-March deadline.That would mean just four months from the initial request, ""nearly a miracle"" in a country where infrastructure projects take years to get approved, one source said.Snam has agreed to keep the FSRU docked in Piombino for three years and to move it to a yet unspecified off-shore location afterwards.Rome could end up granting a discount on gas price of up to 50% for businesses and households in Piombino to allay local concerns and secure support for the project, the commissioner said.

The closely-held company aims to restore more than 85% of pre-fire processing capacity next month and complete repairs to bring the facility back to 100% by March.Contractors and investigators have been swarming the massive Texas Gulf Coast plant where on June 8 compressed gas pipelines burst and exploded into a fireball, a blast blamed on a stuck safety valve and human error.PHMSA will not authorize a partial restart until all the company's proposed changes are received and accepted, the spokesperson said. The regulator so far has approved only pieces of Freeport's proposed changes, called a remedial work plan.The plant's restart will provide needed fuel for heating and power as winter descends on the Northern Hemisphere. Freeport LNG processes about 2 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas and exports up to 15 million tonnes of LNG per year.""The risk is PHMSA saying 'we'd like all the damage repaired before the restart'"" as part of its final approval, said Alex Munton, director of global gas at researcher Rapidan Energy Group. ""Come November, it is not going to be a question of whether Freeport can or wants to restart, it is going to be their (PHMSA) decision.""Work at the Texas site is progressing, said Freeport LNG spokesperson Heather Browne. Plant staff and contractors are focused on ""final repair and restoration efforts, completing work plans and obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals,"" she said.Lead regulator PHMSA in a June order had said it could authorize the company's remedial work plan (RWP), ""without approving the entire RWP."" PHMSA is in charge of a review that includes the U.S. Coast Guard and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.Global LNG prices have cooled with Europe's depleted gas storage levels returning to 92% of targeted capacity this week.

It relied on the Ekofisk North Sea crude grade, produced at a field in Norway where French oil major TotalEnergies has equity, traders said.Ekofisk differentials to dated Brent dropped on Oct. 13 to their lowest since early January as TotalEnergies looked to sell the grade, according to Refinitiv Eikon and industry sources.An Ekofisk cargo is on track for end-October arrival at TotalEnergies' 230,000 bpd Donges refinery, Kpler said, where strike action ended on Wednesday. Walkouts also ended last week at Exxon Mobil's 140,000 barrel per day (bpd) Fos-Sur-Mer and 240,000 bpd Port Jerome-Gravenchon oil refineries.However, Exxon Mobil expects a full restart at its refineries to take 2-3 weeks.

158,d8a00d36-767c-397d-800c-d9b5608fa796,MAS,2022-10-20,Masco (MAS) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/masco-mas-earnings-expected-grow-140102561.html,1666188062,STORY,"['MAS', 'AWI']","[Masco (MAS) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 26, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis maker of Behr paint, Delta faucets and other building products is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.07 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +8.1%.Revenues are expected to be $2.26 billion, up 2.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.33% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Masco?For Masco, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.61%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Masco will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Masco would post earnings of $1.19 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.14, delivering a surprise of -4.20%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Masco doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Building Products - Miscellaneous industry, Armstrong World Industries (AWI), is soon expected to post earnings of $1.49 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +27.4%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $330.91 million, up 13.3% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Armstrong World Industries has remained unchanged. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -7.18%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Armstrong World Industries will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The third-quarter 2022 results are slated to be released on Oct 25, before the opening bell.The consumer financial services company reported adjusted earnings of $1.60 per share for the last quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.43 on the back of solid growth in average active accounts and a higher purchase volume. It also gained from solid contributions from all sales platforms. The results benefited from increased interest and fees on loans. Yet, the results were partially offset by steep expenses.Now, let’s see how things have shaped up prior to the third-quarter earnings announcement.The Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.45 for third-quarter earnings per share has witnessed three upward revisions and one downward movement in the past 60 days. However, the estimate indicates a 13.2% decrease from the year-ago reported figure. Our estimate suggests earnings to be $1.48 per share in the third quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter net investment income is pegged at $3.8 billion, suggesting a jump of 4.8% from the year-ago reported figure. We expect third-quarter net investment income to witness a 3.7% year-over-year increase.Synchrony beat earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 9.4%. This is depicted in the graph below.Synchrony Financial Price and EPS SurpriseSynchrony Financial Price and EPS SurpriseSynchrony Financial price-eps-surprise | Synchrony Financial QuoteWhat the Quantitative Model SuggestsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Synchrony this time around as well. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is currently +11.33%. The Most Accurate Estimate is pegged at $1.62 per share, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.45. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Story continuesZacks Rank: Synchrony currently holds a Zacks Rank #3.Factors Driving Better-Than-Expected EarningsSynchrony Financial is expected to have benefited from a better purchase volume as the economy is growing and people are spending more. Our estimate for total purchase volumes for the third quarter indicates an improvement of 14.2% year over year. SYF is expected to have consistently gained from digital sales volume in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the efficiency ratio is pegged at 38.46%, suggesting a downside from the prior-year reported figure of 38.70%.We expect SYF’s interest and fees on loans for the third quarter to increase to more than $4 billion from $3.9 billion a year ago. The financial service provider is expected to have witnessed an increase in average interest-earnings assets. The consensus estimate indicates a 5.4% increase in the metric from the year-ago period, while our estimate suggests a 3% jump.We expect the net interest margin to rise to 15.6% in the third quarter from 15.5% a year ago. Also, our estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate suggest a rise of 0.9% year over year in average active accounts in the Home &amp; Auto platform in the third quarter. The net charge-offs are also expected to have declined in the quarter in review.While the abovementioned factors are likely to have set the company up for an earnings beat in the third quarter, some elements might partially offset the positives, leading to a year-over-year decline in earnings. The company is expected to have incurred high marketing and business development costs in the third quarter.Our estimate suggests an 18.3% rise in total non-interest expenses,  while professional fees and employee costs are expected to increase 10.3% and 12%, respectively.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other companies from the broader financespace that you may also want to consider, as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around:Axos Financial, Inc.

Synchrony (SYF), which belongs to the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This consumer credit company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 12.48%.For the most recent quarter, Synchrony was expected to post earnings of $1.43 per share, but it reported $1.60 per share instead, representing a surprise of 11.89%.

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Synchrony (SYF) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.62 a share, just six days from its upcoming earnings release on October 25, 2022.By taking the percentage difference between the $1.62 Most Accurate Estimate and the $1.45 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Synchrony has an Earnings ESP of 11.33%.SYF is part of a big group of Finance stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Public Storage (PSA) as well.Public Storage is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on November 1, 2022. PSA's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $4.10 a share 13 days from its next earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Public Storage is $4.05, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 1.34%.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, SYF and PSA could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

He contends that the chip shortage that began at the onset of COVID-19 forced people beyond the industry to understand the importance of semiconductors. Qualcomm's chips are in products as varied as mobile phones, laptops, connected cars, and VR devices.""People realized chips are an essential ingredient for the digital economy and when they look at economic growth,"" he told Yahoo Finance at Thursday's Qualcomm Ventures CEO Summit. ""When you think about the digital transformation of the enterprise, it’s necessary for companies that need to be more efficient. Chips become incredibly important for all of this because you need connectivity.”In other words, he said, “The story about chips is probably as good as it gets.""For now, the volatility of the stock market, high inflation and a hawkish Fed all pose challenges not only to Qualcomm, but to tech companies across the board — for instance, the Nasdaq 100 is down about 32% year-to-date as of Wednesday. Qualcomm's revenue and earnings for the last quarter beat analysts' expectations, and it's set to report its Q4 earnings in early November. The company's shares are down about 40% year-to-date.Chief Executive Officer and President of Qualcomm Incorporated Cristiano Amon speaks at a keynote conference during GSMA's 2022 Mobile World Congress (MWC), in Barcelona, Spain, March 1, 2022. REUTERS/Albert Gea“In the short-term, consistent with what we said in earnings, we have seen a little bit of a slowdown because of the macro,"" said Amon.As Qualcomm finds its way forward in the near-term, the company's diversification strategy — initiated by Amon when he took the helm in 2021 — is front-and-center. For example, Qualcomm Ventures, the company's VC arm, has been focused on investing in companies that build out Qualcomm's ecosystem in forward-looking areas like VR, said Qualcomm Ventures Global Head Quinn Li.Story continuesLi says it's a better time to invest than you might think.“If you look at the last cycle, a lot of big companies actually started and grew in difficult times,"" he said. ""So, from an investor’s perspective, we have the capital to deploy and I think it’s probably a better time to invest than it was the same time last year… I don’t think it’s necessarily a bad time.”A macro environment that's impossible to ignorePolitics have also affected the overarching chips environment, as President Joe Biden recently rattled the industry by restricting chip exports to China. The move grabbed headlines, and Amon said he was concerned in the near-term as to how it might affect chip demand. However, that's not the China-related situation that's most top-of-mind for Amon.“The other thing that’s happening right now is that China is in lockdown,"" he said. ""We’ve seen what’s happening in markets, and when you’ve got a lot of people locked down, you don’t go out and decide the best thing to do is buy a new phone. That has a huge impact on consumer spending.”It doesn't help that the headlines surrounding chip stocks haven't been great lately. Last week, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fell more than 4% before rebounding — another tough day on an index that's down more than 40% year-to-date.“The macro component here, you just can’t ignore it,” Amon said.Allie Garfinkle is a Senior Tech Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Netflix NFLX, Intuitive Surgical ISRG, Lockheed Martin LMT and United Airlines UAL.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:These Stocks Have Popped: Here's WhyAs the Q3 earnings season gathers momentum, investors appear to be handsomely rewarding the companies that improve their revenue and earnings, provided there are also signs of improved visibility.Here is a group of companies that were rewarded this week: Netflix shares jumped 13.8%, Intuitive Surgical 12.1%, Lockheed Martin 8.7%, and United Airlines 7.0%. Let’s see why-NetflixNetflix reported earnings of $3.10 per share that came in higher than the $2.11 estimated. Revenue came in about 1% higher than estimated.The results may have been much better if it wasn’t for the strong dollar, which significantly impacted inflows from its international business. Investors cheered the fact that memberships continued to grow even if it was mainly driven by Asia, signaling that the pandemic-related disruption was probably over.In the earnings release, management highlighted how Amazon and Disney lagged Netflix in engagement, both in the UK and the U.S. But competition is clearly heating up across geographies. Some on the street are saying that the lower-priced ad-supported plan is designed to target an increasingly competitive market. Others have argued the lack of sense in paying for a plan that comes with ads. But management remains optimistic about the launch next month. We’ll have to see how it goes.Netflix is clearly better positioned than its peers today because they are in the initial investment phase and management is probably right in guessing that they’re making huge losses.Story continuesIntuitive SurgicalIntuitive Surgical’s earnings missed estimates by 1.1% but its sales beat by 2.2%.Investors piled into the shares after management stated that the company’s business fundamentals strengthened in the third quarter, as reflected by the growth in its installed base, increases in utilization per system per year and solid performance across geographies.General surgery was the strongest in the U.S.; Europe continued to grow and diversify with particular strength in Germany, the U.K. and Ireland, Italy, and Spain. Asia was also very strong. Despite the COVID-related shut-downs in China, procedure growth in the region did slightly better than the global average. Japan and South Korea also grew strongly.Lockheed MartinLockheed Martin’s reported earnings of $6.87 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.1%. Revenue missed by 1.4%.The Aeronautics segment was the biggest driver of profit, along with the Space segment. Management attributed the increase in cash flows to the “timing of production and billing cycles (primarily the F-35 program” ($325 million of sales from the previous quarter was recognized in the last quarter). Demand remains strong but revenue continues to be impacted by supply chain issues.Lockheed returns value to investors through dividends and share repurchases. The quarterly dividend was increased substantially (by $0.20 to $3.00 per share). Including the increase, the dividend yields 2.7%.Management expects 2023 sales to be consistent with 2022 with growth returning in 2024.United AirlinesUnited Airlines’ earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 27.2% on sales that beat by 1.3%.Better still, management said that Q4 revenue grew 13.2% over 2019 levels, total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) grew 25.5% and even costs came in lower than expected. Additionally, holiday demand in the current quarter is expected to exceed 2019 levels as well.General industry commentary was very positive, and similar to Delta, which reported earlier: “air travel is still in the COVID recovery phase, hybrid work gives customers the freedom and flexibility to travel for leisure more often, and external supply challenges will limit industry supply for years to come.” Management believes these trends will offset the effects of economic headwinds.Netflix, Intuitive Surgical and Lockheed Martin carry #3 Zacks Ranks, which translates to a Hold Rating.

AWI is scheduled to report third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 25, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.5% but increased 11.2% year over year. On the contrary, net sales increased 14.6% year over year and topped the consensus mark by 2.6%.The Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Armstrong World’s third-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.49 per share, suggesting growth of 27.4% from the year-ago quarter’s figure of $1.17. Earnings estimates for the said period have moved down 0.7% in the past seven days, depicting analysts’ concern over the company’s growth potential. The consensus estimate for net sales is pegged at $330.91 million, indicating a 13.3% increase from the prior-year quarter’s figure.Armstrong World Industries, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Armstrong World Industries, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseArmstrong World Industries, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Armstrong World Industries, Inc. Quote Factors to NoteArmstrong World is expected to have registered higher earnings and net sales in the third quarter owing to volume gains in Architectural Specialties, AUV expansion in Mineral Fiber, and acquisitions. Benefits from the acquisitions of Turf, Moz and Arktura in 2020 are also likely to get reflected in the to-be-reported quarter. AWI’s focus on digitalization initiatives and new technology enhancement are encouraging.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Architectural Specialties segment sales is pegged at $83 million, suggesting an increase of 6.4% from the year-ago levels. The same for Mineral Fiber segment sales is pegged at $239 million, up 11.2% from the year-ago levels.The bottom line is expected to have pressurized in the quarter to be reported, thanks to intense inflationary pressure, particularly on input materials and labor. Also, short-term project delays due to material and labor shortages are likely to have impacted third-quarter sales.Moreover, heavy investment in healthy spaces and digitization are increasing costs and thereby denting margins.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t not conclusively predicts an earnings beat for Armstrong World this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Currently, AWI has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -7.18%.

PHM is scheduled to report third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 25, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.8%, but revenues missed the same by 2.5%. Earnings and revenues increased 58.7% and 16.9% on a year-over-year basis, respectively.It is to be noted that PHM surpassed earnings estimates in 21 of the trailing 23 quarters.Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings has decreased 1.1% to $2.76 from $2.79 per share over the past 60 days. Nonetheless, the estimated figure indicates a 51.7% increase from the year-ago earnings of $1.82 per share. Also, the consensus mark for revenues is $4.05 billion, suggesting 16.4% year-over-year growth.PulteGroup, Inc. Price and EPS SurprisePulteGroup, Inc. Price and EPS SurprisePulteGroup, Inc. price-eps-surprise | PulteGroup, Inc. QuoteFactors to NoteThe U.S. housing market has been navigating through a challenging time comprising rising mortgage rates, continued supply-chain issues, material cost inflation and higher wages. Higher mortgage rates and higher home prices have been prompting for moderation in housing demand.Nonetheless, PulteGroup has been reaping benefits from the successful execution of initiatives to boost profitability, with a focus on entry-level homes. The company’s earnings and revenues are expected to have increased in the third quarter, given a prudent land investment strategy, higher pricing and affordable product offerings.However, unprecedented supply-chain challenges and labor shortages are likely to have created hurdles for builders to fulfill orders and deliveries, thereby impacting revenues and orders.PulteGroup expects the closing of 7,000 - 7,400 homes for the third quarter, indicating an increase (considering the mid-point of the guided range) from 7,007 homes delivered a year ago. It expects a higher average selling price or ASP for the quarter in the range of $540,000-$550,000, suggesting an increase from $474,000 in the year-ago period.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Homebuilding revenues of $4.03 billion suggests an increase of 18.8% from $3.39 billion a year ago, courtesy of higher ASP.From the margin perspective, input cost inflation and high costs associated with labor and transportation are expected to have weighed on margins to some extent. That said, higher pricing and prudent cost-saving efforts are likely to have mitigated the risks.Story continuesGiven these cost price dynamics, the company expects homebuilding gross margins to expand to 30% for third-quarter 2022 from 26.5% reported in the year-ago period.SG&amp;A expenses (as a percentage of home sales revenues) for the quarter are expected to be in the 9.1-9.3% range. The figure was 9.6% a year ago.Overall, higher prices and improved operating leverage, are expected to have benefited PulteGroup’s earnings and revenues in the third quarter amid continuous supply-chain woes.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for PulteGroup for the quarter to be reported. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: PHM has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

If you want to skip our introduction to the investment guru, and want to take a look at the top five stocks in this list, then head on over to 5 Warren Buffett Stocks That Are Too Cheap To Ignore. The bloodbath in the stock market this year that has shocked investors and rattled retail investors has seen major stock market indexes once again bleed big chunks of their value just as they had started to recover from the coronavirus pandemic. The NASDAQ Composite index is down a painful 35% year to date, the New York Stock Exchange has lost an equally painful 21% and the Dow Jones Index is now down 19%.During these times, it's hard to fathom putting more money in the market as the soaring U.S. dollar itself becomes a safe haven and cash funds become 'king.' However, for the astute investor, there might be opportunities to sift out which companies saw their fortunes turn simply due to the larger macroeconomic environment and not because of any fundamental weakness.Two ratios used by Wall Street to get a rough idea of whether a company is undervalued or overvalued are the price to earnings (P/E) and price to sales (P/S) ratios. These take a look at a firm's revenue or earnings and compare them with the share price to determine what is the 'premium' offered by the market over their ability to make money. The P/S ratio is used for firms that are yet to generate a profit, and the P/E ratio is for those that regularly churn out bottom line profits.The billionaire financial guru Warren Buffett is the most renowned name in the financial industry, and he is at the helm of the holding company Berkshire Hathaway. Berkshire's investment portfolio dwarfs all hedge funds out there, and by the end of this year's second quarter it was worth a staggering $300 billion - which is more than the central bank foreign exchange reserves of most of the world's countries, including the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States ($229 billion) and the Bank of England of the United Kingdom ($178 billion).Story continuesTherefore, it's safe to assume that Mr. Buffett is doing something right when it comes to investing, and over the course of his career, his firm has provided 20% average returns, which is more than double the Standard and Poor 500 index's return according to Forbes Magazine. The same magazine also has a net worth estimate for the investor and estimates that as of September 2022, Mr. Buffett was worth a staggering $95.5 billion.

In contrast to the other payment providers, Stone also has a sizable software business. In addition, Stone is working towards becoming a full-fledged financial services provider. Both endeavors add costs to the P&amp;L, but do not yet add meaningful profits, which is about to change. Particularly the lending business could become bigger and more profitable than the current bread-and-butter payments business.

The therapy has been developed in partnership with J&amp;J JNJ.Per an SEC filing by LEGN, Carvykti generated preliminary revenues of around $55 million in net trade sales. Carvykti, a B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) CAR-T therapy, was approved by the FDA for treating relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma in February 2022.Carvykti has been developed as part of an exclusive worldwide license and collaboration agreement entered in 2017 with Janssen Biotech, a J&amp;J company, to develop and market Carvykti. Per the agreement, J&amp;J is responsible for marketing the therapy, while Legend Biotech will record collaboration revenues from J&amp;J.In the year so far, Legend Biotech’s shares have declined 1.5% compared with the industry’s 25.0% slump.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEarlier this May, Carvykti was also granted conditional marketing authorization for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma in the European Union.Carvykti is also Legend Biotech’s first marketed therapy. The strong sales for a recently approved therapy like Carvykti will provide Legend Biotech with a stable stream of revenues, thereby allowing management to develop its other pipeline candidates targeting hematological malignancies and solid tumors.Please note that the figures released by LEGN are preliminary and unaudited. Final results will be issued upon completion of its closing procedures and may vary from these preliminary estimates. The $55 million preliminary sales figure for Carvykti has been provided by J&amp;J and is yet to be verified by Legend Biotech.Carvykti faces stiff competition from Abecma, an FDA-approved CAR-T cell therapy for multiple myeloma developed by bluebird bio BLUE in collaboration with Bristol Myers BMY. Per the terms of collaboration, Bristol Myers has exclusive rights to market Abecma and in return, bluebird was eligible to receive royalties. Following bluebird’s separation of its oncology business into a new separate entity with effect from November 2021, the royalties receivable on Abecma product sales along with Bristol Myers partnership were transferred to the new entity as well.Story continuesLegend Biotech Corporation Sponsored ADR Price Legend Biotech Corporation Sponsored ADR PriceLegend Biotech Corporation Sponsored ADR price | Legend Biotech Corporation Sponsored ADR Quote Zacks RankLegend Biotech currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The division responsible for manufacturing over-the-counter (OTC) drugs could gain the attention of leading private equity firms and other consumer healthcare companies that are interested in creating synergies and experiencing growth in the region. Viatris Inc.

At the company level, we hold select companies in pharmaceuticals, healthcare services and health insurance at attractive valuations. This is at a time when the average age of the U.S. population is fast approaching 40, older than Asia-Pacific and a little younger than the aged populations of Europe and Japan. The number of seniors in the U.S.—i.e., 65 years or older— now surpasses 54 million, or about 15% of the population. Seniors, on average, take a much greater number of medications and account for a large and disproportionate share of healthcare spending, and we expect that trend to continue due to both raw demographics and a proliferation in the number of available treatments and services available now, the latter being driven by innovation and investment in the healthcare industry. Representative holdings in the Fund include Cigna, United Health Group, Viatris and Quest Diagnostics.”9. Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 54Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) is a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotechnology company that is focused on finding treatments for neurological diseases.On October 12, Paul Matteis at Stifel upgraded Biogen Inc.

Biogen Inc.’s (NASDAQ:BIIB) share price has been on an upward trend following the disclosure of the positive data for lecanemab, with very few concerns related to competitive and commercial risks. The analyst thinks that the risk and reward profile of Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) stock is skewed towards the reward side.Longleaf Partners Fund shared its stance on Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB)  in its Q4 2021 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“Biogen (83%, 2.43%; 5%, 0.10%), a biotechnology company specializing in therapies for the treatment of neurological diseases, was a strong contributor before we exited the position in the first half. We began acquiring shares in January 2021, paying between 9- 11x FCF and a discount to our appraisal, even if the company’s promising drug pipeline turned out to be worth 0. After Biogen’s Alzheimer drug Aduhelm was approved in June, we quickly sold out after the stock’s price appreciated over 70% and briefly exceeded our appraisal of the value. We re-initiated a position in Biogen in December at a price below our original cost basis from January. The stock became very cheap once again after Aduhelm’s early sales disappointed due to its high initial cost before management correctly cut the price. We think Biogen’s core Multiple sclerosis (MS) and Biosimilars businesses are strong enough to create sustainable double-digit EPS growth, even if Aduhelm and the entire Alzheimer’s program is worth zero. We also expect a board led by large shareholders to continue the company’s accretive repurchase, while considering other beneficial corporate actions.”8. Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) is a Thousand Oaks, California-based biotechnology company.On October 11, Matthew Harrison at Morgan Stanley upgraded Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) stock from an Equal Weight to an Overweight rating and also increased the target price from $279 to $257. Given the potential of the medium-term drug pipeline of the company, the analyst thinks Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) is amongst the best pharmaceutical stocks to invest in. Harrison believes that in the current macroeconomic environment, Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) offers a defensive positioning with an attractive long-term upside potential based on the outlook of the AMG133 for obesity care and the launch of biosimilar Amjevita.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Aristotle Capital Management shared its insights on Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN). Here’s what the firm said:“Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN), the pharmaceutical company focused on biotechnology-based therapeutics, was also a top contributor for the quarter. The company reported solid results, with a variety of products, such as bone-strengthening drugs Prolia and EVENITY, contributing to overall revenue growth. Amgen continued to increase the market share for cholesterol drug Repatha (a catalyst we had originally identified), delivering record quarterly sales as the drug’s usage expands with high-risk patients who have not yet had a cardiovascular event, and as barriers for prescribers, healthcare systems and patients are removed. In addition, we believe the company is poised to gain market share with its biosimilars (akin to generic versions of biologic drugs), also a previously identified catalyst. Biosimilars accounted for over $2 billion in revenue in 2021, and we believe this has the potential to more than double by the end of the decade, accelerated by six additional biosimilars (for a total of 11 products on the market). This includes the upcoming launch in the U.S. of arthritis treatment Amjetiva in January 2023. Meanwhile, the company is advancing its robust pipeline of early- and late-stage assets, with several phase III results due this year. These developments have caused us to remain enthusiastic about Amgen’s ability to build on its decades of success developing novel treatments using biopharmaceuticals.”7. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) is a Foster City, California-based pharmaceutical company focused on developing antiviral drugs.Chris Schott at JPMorgan upgraded Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) stock from a Neutral to an Overweight rating on October 4. The analyst also increased the target price from $72 to $80. Schott highlighted that the current valuation of Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) does not truly reflect the higher visibility of the HIV division and the rising oncology division of the business. The analyst elaborated that the current market capitalization of Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) only covers the value of the HIV business. The company’s oncology division is expected to post annual sales of $5 billion by the end of this decade.Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) offers an annual forward dividend yield of 5.63% as of October 17. The company’s strong growth prospects have led many to see its as one of the best pharmaceutical stocks to invest in.Of the 895 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database, Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) was held by 58 hedge funds as of Q2 2022.6. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) is a New York-based biopharmaceutical company that has seen a significant surge in revenue and earnings following the acquisition of cancer specialist Celgene and cardiology company MyoKardia. The company has also been focusing on internal operations to expand its drug portfolio.Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) holds a leading position in the field of oncology and works actively to enhance its presence in the fields of cardiovascular and immunological diseases. Experts believe that the company’s clinical and regulatory execution has been solid this year as it received approval for multiple drugs, namely Camzyos, Opdualag, and Sotyktu. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) is investing heavily in research and development for its Phase- III trials. Analysts think Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) is amongst the best pharmaceutical stocks as the stock offers considerable upside in the long run.Here’s what Baron Funds said about Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“We established a position in Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, a global biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing, and selling medicines for patients in the therapeutic areas of oncology, immunology, cardiovascular, and neurology. The stock trades at a low valuation relative to its current earnings because the company faces loss of exclusivity on several key drugs over the next eight years, including Revlimid, Eliquis, and Opdivo.At the same time, Bristol-Myers has multiple new products in the early stages of launch (e.g., Opdualag, Camzyos, Breyanzi, and Reblozyl), a robust new product pipeline (e.g., Deucravacitinib, Milvexian, and CELMoD agents), and a strong balance sheet combined with strong free cash flow generation that the company can use for acquisitions. Management believes these growth drivers can more than offset the loss of exclusivity and drive revenue growth through the end of the decade. Given the company’s low valuation, if the company can execute, we think there is substantial upside in the stock.”In addition to Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY), companies like Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) are among the best pharmaceutical stocks in the industry. Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Drug Stocks to Buy Now. Suggested Articles:15 Best Gambling Stocks To BuyBest Asian Stocks To Buy11 Best Big Data Stocks To Invest InDisclose.

This compares to FFO of $1.77 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an FFO surprise of 1.09%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this operator of wireless communications towers would post FFO of $1.79 per share when it actually produced FFO of $1.80, delivering a surprise of 0.56%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates four times.Crown Castle , which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry, posted revenues of $1.75 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.55%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.62 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Crown Castle shares have lost about 36.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -22%.What's Next for Crown Castle?While Crown Castle has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's FFO outlook. Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Crown Castle: unfavorable.

(NYSE: CCI) (""Crown Castle"") today reported results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2022, maintained its full year 2022 outlook and issued its full year 2023 outlook, as reflected in the table below. Full Year 2023 Full Year 2022(dollars in millions, except per share amounts)Current Outlook Midpoint(a)Midpoint Growth Rate Compared to Previous Year Outlook Current Outlook Midpoint(a)Midpoint Growth Rate Compared to Previous Year Actual Site rental revenues$6,5114% $6,26510%Income (loss) from continuing operations$1,636(3)% $1,69446%Income (loss) from continuing operations per share—diluted$3.76(4)% $3.9046%Adjusted EBITDA(b)$4,4723% $4,35214%AFFO(b)$3,3194% $3,2016%AFFO per share(b)$7.634% $7.366%(a) As issued on October 19, 2022, and, with respect to the current full year 2022 Outlook, unchanged from the previous full year 2022 Outlook issued on July 20, 2022.(b) See ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures, Segment Measures and Other Calculations"" for further information and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to income (loss) from continuing operations, as computed in accordance with GAAP.“We delivered strong results in the third quarter and increased our annualized common stock dividend by 6.5% to $6.26 per share,” stated Jay Brown, Crown Castle’s Chief Executive Officer. “Since we established our long-term annual dividend per share growth target of 7% to 8% in 2017 and inclusive of the increase announced today, we have grown dividends per share at a compound annual growth rate of 9%. The dividend increase is supported by the expected growth in cash flows in 2023 and reflects our confidence in the strength of our business model despite the challenging global macroeconomic environment. I believe we remain in the early stages of 5G development in the U.S., providing a long runway of growth in demand for our comprehensive communications infrastructure offering across towers, small cells and fiber. Our customers continue to upgrade their macro tower networks, and we expect another year of strong growth in 2023 with 5% organic revenue growth in our Towers segment. Further, we expect small cell growth to accelerate in 2023 by doubling our small cell deployments to 10,000 nodes, more than half of which will be collocated on existing fiber with returns in line with our expectations for lease-up economics.Story continues“I believe the positive operating trends across the business position us well to navigate some challenges with higher interest rates and the previously disclosed rationalization of a portion of Sprint's legacy network that will impact our growth in the near-term. Looking out beyond those challenges, I believe our domestic portfolio of 40,000 towers, 115,000 small cells on air or under contract and 85,000 route miles of fiber provides a great opportunity to benefit from the development of next-generation wireless networks in the best market in the world and extends our ability to create value for our shareholders.”RESULTS FOR THE QUARTERThe table below sets forth select financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021.(dollars in millions, except per share amounts)Q3 2022Q3 2021ChangeChange %Site rental revenues$1,568$1,451$1178%Income (loss) from continuing operations$419$351$6819%Income (loss) from continuing operations per share—diluted$0.97$0.81$0.1620%Adjusted EBITDA(a)$1,077$976$10110%AFFO(a)$804$767$375%AFFO per share(a)$1.85$1.77$0.085%(a) See ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures, Segment Measures and Other Calculations"" for further information and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to income (loss) from continuing operations, as computed in accordance with GAAP.HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE QUARTERSite rental revenues. Site rental revenues grew 8%, or $117 million, from third quarter 2021 to third quarter 2022, inclusive of approximately $67 million in Organic Contribution to Site Rental Billings and a $52 million increase in straight-lined revenues. The $67 million in Organic Contribution to Site Rental Billings represents 5.3% growth, comprised of 8.6% growth from core leasing activity and contracted tenant escalations, net of 3.3% from tenant non-renewals.Income from continuing operations. Income from continuing operations for the third quarter 2022 was $419 million compared to $351 million for the third quarter 2021.Adjusted EBITDA. Third quarter 2022 Adjusted EBITDA was $1.1 billion compared to $976 million for the third quarter 2021, representing 10% growth from the third quarter 2021, primarily as a result of the growth in site rental revenues and higher services contribution.AFFO and AFFO per share. Third quarter 2022 AFFO was $804 million, or $1.85 per share, representing growth from the third quarter 2021 of 5% for each.Capital expenditures. Capital expenditures during the quarter were $337 million, comprised of $23 million of sustaining capital expenditures and $314 million of discretionary capital expenditures. Discretionary capital expenditures during the quarter primarily included approximately $267 million attributable to Fiber and approximately $42 million attributable to Towers.Common stock dividend. During the quarter, Crown Castle paid common stock dividends of approximately $637 million in the aggregate, or $1.47 per common share, an increase of approximately 11% on a per share basis compared to the same period a year ago.“We are excited about the activity levels across our business as our customers are deploying 5G at scale, highlighted by the nearly 6.5% organic revenue growth in our Towers segment year to date,” stated Dan Schlanger, Crown Castle’s Chief Financial Officer. “In the near term, the rapidly rising interest rate environment has accelerated an increase in our expected 2023 interest expense, causing some headwinds to our growth in 2023. These headwinds are largely offset by an expected acceleration of future billings resulting from the Sprint network decommissioning work, allowing us to maintain our annual dividend per share growth in line with our long-term 7% to 8% target.“Longer term, I believe the combination of persistent growth in mobile data demand in the U.S., our long-term customer contracts that include more than $40 billion in remaining contracted tenant receivables, a cost structure that is largely fixed in nature, and our lack of exposure to higher risk international markets provides a solid foundation to support growing cash flows through various economic cycles. In addition, we have an investment grade balance sheet with nearly 85% fixed-rate debt, a weighted average maturity across our debt of approximately nine years, limited debt maturities through 2024 and more than $4.5 billion in available liquidity under our revolving credit facility. As a result, I believe we are well positioned to pursue investment opportunities that are consistent with our strategy and support our ability to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns through a combination of dividends and growth.”OUTLOOKThis Outlook section contains forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. Information regarding potential risks which could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements herein is set forth below and in Crown Castle's filings with the SEC.The following table sets forth Crown Castle's current outlook for full year 2022, which is unchanged from the previous full year 2022 Outlook, and Crown Castle's full year 2023 Outlook.(in millions, except per share amounts)Full Year 2022Full Year 2023Site rental revenues$6,242to$6,287$6,488to$6,533Site rental costs of operations(a)$1,548to$1,593$1,643to$1,688Income (loss) from continuing operations$1,654to$1,734$1,596to$1,676Adjusted EBITDA(b)$4,329to$4,374$4,449to$4,494Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs(c)$680to$725$814to$859FFO(b)$3,343to$3,388$3,350to$3,395AFFO(b)$3,178to$3,223$3,296to$3,341AFFO per share(b)$7.31to$7.41$7.58to$7.68(a) Exclusive of depreciation, amortization and accretion.

Inc. (“T-Mobile”) and Sprint network consolidation (“Sprint Cancellations”). These expected cancellations impact run-rate site rental revenues by $30 million and are offset by cash payments of approximately $165 million to satisfy the remaining rental obligations associated with the Sprint Cancellations. The net $135 million impact of the cancellations and the cash payments is referred to herein as “Impact of Sprint Cancellations.” Additionally, the 2023 Outlook includes approximately $50 million in expected accelerated amortization of prepaid rent from the remaining deferred revenues associated with the Sprint Cancellations.The chart below reconciles the expected growth in site rental revenues from 2022 to 2023 of $215 million to $260 million, inclusive of expected Organic Contribution to Site Rental Billings during 2023 of $340 million to $380 million, or approximately 7%. The expected consolidated growth includes approximately 5% from towers, approximately 25% from small cells, and approximately 5% from fiber solutions. Normalized for the expected Impact of Sprint Cancellations, consolidated growth of approximately 4% includes approximately 5% from towers, approximately 8% from small cells and flat fiber solutions revenue.Crown Castle International Corp.Core leasing activity for full year 2023 is expected to contribute $285 million to $315 million, consisting of $135 million to $145 million from towers (compared to $150 million to $160 million expected in full year 2022), $30 million to $40 million from small cells (compared to $25 million to $35 million expected in full year 2022), and $120 million to $130 million from fiber solutions (compared to $145 million to $155 million expected in full year 2022).The expected full year 2023 non-renewal of $190 million to $210 million includes approximately $30 million from Sprint Cancellations.The full year 2023 straight-line site rental revenue is expected to be approximately $125 million to $145 million lower than expected full year 2022, reflecting the significant portion of the expected 5% growth from towers that is contracted.Prepaid rent amortization is expected to increase by approximately $10 million for full year 2023, with approximately $60 million in expected growth from the Fiber segment (including $50 million associated with the Sprint Cancellations) offset by an expected $50 million reduction in Towers segment.The chart below reconciles the components of expected growth in AFFO from 2022 to 2023 of $100 million to $145 million.Crown Castle International Corp.The expected increase in expenses includes approximately $20 million in higher labor-related and other operating expenses associated with the higher inflationary environment.The expected growth in full year 2023 AFFO includes the impact of approximately $120 million to $160 million of additional interest expense related to higher expected interest rates.In addition, discretionary capital expenditures are expected to be $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion in 2023, which compares to approximately $1.2 billion expected for full year 2022. The increase in discretionary capital expenditures for full year 2023 primarily reflects the expected acceleration in small cell deployments to approximately 10,000 in 2023 compared to approximately 5,000 deployed in 2022. Prepaid rent additions are expected to be approximately $450 million in 2023 compared to approximately $300 million expected in 2022.Additional information is available in Crown Castle's quarterly Supplemental Information Package posted in the Investors section of our website.DIVIDEND INCREASE ANNOUNCEMENTCrown Castle's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.565 per common share, representing an increase of approximately 6.5% over the previous quarterly dividend of $1.47 per share.

These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as alternative measures of operating results or cash flow from operations (as determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP"")).Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including other companies in the communications infrastructure sector or other real estate investment trusts (""REITs"").In addition to the non-GAAP financial measures used herein, we also provide segment site rental gross margin, segment services and other gross margin and segment operating profit, which are key measures used by management to evaluate our operating segments. These segment measures are provided pursuant to GAAP requirements related to segment reporting. In addition, we provide the components of certain GAAP measures, such as site rental revenues and capital expenditures.Our non-GAAP financial measures are presented as additional information because management believes these measures are useful indicators of the financial performance of our business. Among other things, management believes that:Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is the primary measure used by management (1) to evaluate the economic productivity of our operations and (2) for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, our operations. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1) from period to period and (2) to our competitors, by removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our financial results. Management also believes Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of the communications infrastructure sector and other REITs to measure financial performance without regard to items such as depreciation, amortization and accretion, which can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is similar to the measure of current financial performance generally used in our debt covenant calculations. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered only as a supplement to income (loss) from continuing operations computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance.AFFO, including per share amounts, is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Management believes that AFFO helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate our financial performance as it includes (1) the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense on our outstanding debt and dividends on our preferred stock (in periods where applicable)) and (2) sustaining capital expenditures, and excludes the impact of our (1) asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) and (2) certain non-cash items, including straight-lined revenues and expenses related to fixed escalations and rent free periods. GAAP requires rental revenues and expenses related to leases that contain specified rental increases over the life of the lease to be recognized evenly over the life of the lease. In accordance with GAAP, if payment terms call for fixed escalations or rent free periods, the revenues or expenses are recognized on a straight-lined basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the contract. Management notes that Crown Castle uses AFFO only as a performance measure. AFFO should be considered only as a supplement to income (loss) from continuing operations computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operations or as residual cash flow available for discretionary investment.FFO, including per share amounts, is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Management believes that FFO may be used by investors or other interested parties as a basis to compare our financial performance with that of other REITs. FFO helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate financial performance by excluding the impact of our asset base (primarily real estate depreciation, amortization and accretion). FFO is not a key performance indicator used by Crown Castle. FFO should be considered only as a supplement to income (loss) from continuing operations computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operations.Organic Contribution to Site Rental Billings is useful to investors or other interested parties in understanding the components of the year-over-year changes in our site rental revenues computed in accordance with GAAP. Management uses Organic Contribution to Site Rental Billings to assess year-over-year growth rates for our rental activities, to evaluate current performance, to capture trends in rental rates, core leasing activities and tenant non-renewals in our core business, as well as to forecast future results. Organic Contribution to Site Rental Billings is not meant as an alternative measure of revenue and should be considered only as a supplement in understanding and assessing the performance of our site rental revenues computed in accordance with GAAP.We define our non-GAAP financial measures, segment measures and other calculations as follows:Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresAdjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as income (loss) from continuing operations plus restructuring charges (credits), asset write-down charges, acquisition and integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments, interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, (gains) losses on retirement of long-term obligations, net (gain) loss on interest rate swaps, (gains) losses on foreign currency swaps, impairment of available-for-sale securities, interest income, other (income) expense, (benefit) provision for income taxes, cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and stock-based compensation expense.Adjusted Funds from Operations. We define Adjusted Funds from Operations as FFO before straight-lined revenues, straight-lined expenses, stock-based compensation expense, non-cash portion of tax provision, non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of non-cash interest expense, other (income) expense, (gains) losses on retirement of long-term obligations, net (gain) loss on interest rate swaps, (gains) losses on foreign currency swaps, impairment of available-for-sale securities, acquisition and integration costs, restructuring charges (credits), cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and adjustments for noncontrolling interests, less sustaining capital expenditures.AFFO per share. We define AFFO per share as AFFO divided by diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding.Funds from Operations. We define Funds from Operations as income (loss) from continuing operations plus real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion and asset write-down charges, less noncontrolling interest and cash paid for preferred stock dividends (in periods where applicable), and is a measure of funds from operations attributable to common stockholders.FFO per share. We define FFO per share as FFO divided by diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding.Organic Contribution to Site Rental Billings. We define Organic Contribution to Site Rental Billings as the sum of the change in GAAP site rental revenues related to core leasing activity, escalators, and the payments for Sprint Cancellations, less non-renewals of tenant contracts.Segment MeasuresSegment site rental gross margin. We define segment site rental gross margin as segment site rental revenues less segment site rental costs of operations, excluding stock-based compensation expense and amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments recorded in consolidated site rental costs of operations.Segment services and other gross margin. We define segment services and other gross margin as segment services and other revenues less segment services and other costs of operations, excluding stock-based compensation expense recorded in consolidated services and other costs of operations.Segment operating profit. We define segment operating profit as segment site rental gross margin plus segment services and other gross margin, and segment other operating (income) expense, less selling, general and administrative expenses attributable to the respective segment.All of these measurements of profit or loss are exclusive of depreciation, amortization and accretion, which are shown separately. Additionally, certain costs are shared across segments and are reflected in our segment measures through allocations that management believes to be reasonable.Other CalculationsSite rental billings. We define site rental billings as site rental revenues exclusive of the impacts from (1) straight-lined revenues, (2) amortization of prepaid rent in accordance with GAAP and (3) contribution from recent acquisitions until the one-year anniversary of such acquisitions.Core leasing activity. We define core leasing activity as site rental revenues growth from tenant additions across our entire portfolio and renewals or extensions of tenant contracts, exclusive of the impacts from both straight-lined revenues and amortization of prepaid rent in accordance with GAAP.Non-renewals. We define non-renewals of tenant contracts as the reduction in site rental revenues as a result of tenant churn, terminations and, in limited circumstances, reductions of existing lease rates.Discretionary capital expenditures. We define discretionary capital expenditures as those capital expenditures made with respect to activities which we believe exhibit sufficient potential to enhance long-term stockholder value. They primarily consist of expansion or development of communications infrastructure (including capital expenditures related to (1) enhancing communications infrastructure in order to add new tenants for the first time or support subsequent tenant equipment augmentations or (2) modifying the structure of a communications infrastructure asset to accommodate additional tenants) and construction of new communications infrastructure. Discretionary capital expenditures also include purchases of land interests (which primarily relates to land assets under towers as we seek to manage our interests in the land beneath our towers), certain technology-related investments necessary to support and scale future customer demand for our communications infrastructure, and other capital projects.Sustaining capital expenditures. We define sustaining capital expenditures as those capital expenditures not otherwise categorized as discretionary capital expenditures, such as (1) maintenance capital expenditures on our communications infrastructure assets that enable our tenants' ongoing quiet enjoyment of the communications infrastructure and (2) ordinary corporate capital expenditures.The tables set forth on the

Such statements include our full year 2022 and 2023 Outlooks and plans, projections, and estimates regarding (1) potential benefits, growth, returns, capabilities, opportunities and shareholder value which may be derived from our business, strategy, risk profile, assets and customer solutions, investments, acquisitions and dividends, (2) our business, strategy, strategic position, business model and capabilities and the strength thereof, (3) 5G deployment in the United States and our customers' strategy and plans with respect thereto and demand for our assets and solutions created by such deployment, (4) our long- and near-term prospects and challenges (including the global macroeconomic environment), and the trends, events and industry activities affecting our business, including the impact on our business therefrom, (5) opportunities we see to deliver value to our shareholders, (6) our dividends (including timing of payment thereof), dividend targets, dividend payout ratio, and our long- and short-term dividend (including on a per share basis) growth rate (including compound annual growth rate), and its driving factors, (7) our debt and debt maturities, (8) cash flows, including growth thereof, (9) leasing environment and the leasing activity, including core leasing activity, we see in our business, and the benefits and opportunities created thereby and the impacts therefrom, (10) tenant non-renewals, including the impact and timing thereof, (11) capital expenditures, including sustaining and discretionary capital expenditures, the timing and funding thereof and any benefits that may result therefrom, (12) revenues and growth thereof (including with respect to our Towers business) and benefits derived therefrom, (13) income (loss) from continuing operations (including on a per share basis), (14) Adjusted EBITDA, including components thereof and growth thereof, (15) costs and expenses, including interest expense (and the increase thereof) and amortization of deferred financing costs, (16) FFO (including on a per share basis) and growth thereof, (17) AFFO (including on a per share basis) and its components and growth thereof and corresponding driving factors, (18) Organic Contribution to Site Rental Billings and its components, including growth thereof and contributions therefrom, (19) our weighted-average common shares outstanding (including on a diluted basis) and growth thereof, (20) site rental revenues and the growth thereof, (21) annual small cell deployment and the impacts therefrom, including its driving factors, (22) prepaid rent, including the additions and the amortization and growth thereof, (23) the strength of the U.S. market for communications infrastructure ownership, (24) the strength of our balance sheet, (25) investment opportunities and the benefits that may be derived therefrom, (26) interest rates, including the increase thereof, and the impacts therefrom, (27) services contribution, (28) the impact of Sprint network decommissioning, including the impact of T-Mobile payments in connection therewith and (29) the utility of certain financial measures, including non-GAAP financial measures. All future dividends are subject to declaration by our board of directors.Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including prevailing market conditions and the following:Our business depends on the demand for our communications infrastructure, driven primarily by demand for data, and we may be adversely affected by any slowdown in such demand. Additionally, a reduction in the amount or change in the mix of network investment by our tenants may materially and adversely affect our business (including reducing demand for our communications infrastructure or services).A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of tenants, and the loss, consolidation or financial instability of any of such tenants may materially decrease revenues or reduce demand for our communications infrastructure and services.The expansion or development of our business, including through acquisitions, increased product offerings or other strategic growth opportunities, may cause disruptions in our business, which may have an adverse effect on our business, operations or financial results.Our Fiber segment has expanded rapidly, and the Fiber business model contains certain differences from our Towers business model, resulting in different operational risks. If we do not successfully operate our Fiber business model or identify or manage the related operational risks, such operations may produce results that are lower than anticipated.Failure to timely, efficiently and safely execute on our construction projects could adversely affect our business.New technologies may reduce demand for our communications infrastructure or negatively impact our revenues.If we fail to retain rights to our communications infrastructure, including the rights to land under our towers and the right-of-way and other agreements related to our small cells and fiber, our business may be adversely affected.Our services business has historically experienced significant volatility in demand, which reduces the predictability of our results.If radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets or equipment on our communications infrastructure are demonstrated to cause negative health effects, potential future claims could adversely affect our operations, costs or revenues.Cybersecurity breaches or other information technology disruptions could adversely affect our operations, business and reputation.Our business may be adversely impacted by climate-related events, natural disasters, including wildfires, and other unforeseen events.The impact of COVID-19 and related risks could materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.As a result of competition in our industry, we may find it more difficult to negotiate favorable rates on our new or renewing tenant contracts.New wireless technologies may not deploy or be adopted by tenants as rapidly or in the manner projected.Our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business, and the terms of our debt instruments limit our ability to take a number of actions that our management might otherwise believe to be in our best interests. In addition, if we fail to comply with our covenants, our debt could be accelerated.We have a substantial amount of indebtedness. In the event we do not repay or refinance such indebtedness, we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations.Sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.Certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated by-laws and operative agreements, and domestic and international competition laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or for us to acquire control of a third party, even if such a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders.If we fail to comply with laws or regulations which regulate our business and which may change at any time, we may be fined or even lose our right to conduct some of our business.Future dividend payments to our stockholders will reduce the availability of our cash on hand available to fund future discretionary investments, and may result in a need to incur indebtedness or issue equity securities to fund growth opportunities. In such event, the then current economic, credit market or equity market conditions will impact the availability or cost of such financing, which may hinder our ability to grow our per share results of operations.Remaining qualified to be taxed as a REIT involves highly technical and complex provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Failure to remain qualified as a REIT would result in our inability to deduct dividends to stockholders when computing our taxable income, which would reduce our available cash.Complying with REIT requirements, including the 90% distribution requirement, may limit our flexibility or cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities, including certain discretionary investments and potential financing alternatives.REIT related ownership limitations and transfer restrictions may prevent or restrict certain transfers of our capital stock.Should one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those expected. More information about potential risk factors which could affect our results is included in our filings with the SEC. Our filings with the SEC are available through the SEC website at www.sec.gov or through our investor relations website at investor.crowncastle.com. We use our investor relations website to disclose information about us that may be deemed to be material. We encourage investors, the media and others interested in us to visit our investor relations website from time to time to review up-to-date information or to sign up for e-mail alerts to be notified when new or updated information is posted on the site.As used in this release, the term ""including,"" and any variation thereof, means ""including without limitation.""CROWN CASTLE INC.CONDENSED

The number of seniors in the U.S.—i.e., 65 years or older— now surpasses 54 million, or about 15% of the population. Seniors, on average, take a much greater number of medications and account for a large and disproportionate share of healthcare spending, and we expect that trend to continue due to both raw demographics and a proliferation in the number of available treatments and services available now, the latter being driven by innovation and investment in the healthcare industry. Representative holdings in the Fund include Cigna, United Health Group, Viatris and Quest Diagnostics.”9. Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 54Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) is a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotechnology company that is focused on finding treatments for neurological diseases.On October 12, Paul Matteis at Stifel upgraded Biogen Inc.

Biogen Inc.’s (NASDAQ:BIIB) share price has been on an upward trend following the disclosure of the positive data for lecanemab, with very few concerns related to competitive and commercial risks. The analyst thinks that the risk and reward profile of Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) stock is skewed towards the reward side.Longleaf Partners Fund shared its stance on Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB)  in its Q4 2021 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“Biogen (83%, 2.43%; 5%, 0.10%), a biotechnology company specializing in therapies for the treatment of neurological diseases, was a strong contributor before we exited the position in the first half. We began acquiring shares in January 2021, paying between 9- 11x FCF and a discount to our appraisal, even if the company’s promising drug pipeline turned out to be worth 0. After Biogen’s Alzheimer drug Aduhelm was approved in June, we quickly sold out after the stock’s price appreciated over 70% and briefly exceeded our appraisal of the value. We re-initiated a position in Biogen in December at a price below our original cost basis from January. The stock became very cheap once again after Aduhelm’s early sales disappointed due to its high initial cost before management correctly cut the price. We think Biogen’s core Multiple sclerosis (MS) and Biosimilars businesses are strong enough to create sustainable double-digit EPS growth, even if Aduhelm and the entire Alzheimer’s program is worth zero. We also expect a board led by large shareholders to continue the company’s accretive repurchase, while considering other beneficial corporate actions.”8. Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) is a Thousand Oaks, California-based biotechnology company.On October 11, Matthew Harrison at Morgan Stanley upgraded Amgen Inc.

Harrison believes that in the current macroeconomic environment, Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) offers a defensive positioning with an attractive long-term upside potential based on the outlook of the AMG133 for obesity care and the launch of biosimilar Amjevita.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Aristotle Capital Management shared its insights on Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN). Here’s what the firm said:“Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN), the pharmaceutical company focused on biotechnology-based therapeutics, was also a top contributor for the quarter. The company reported solid results, with a variety of products, such as bone-strengthening drugs Prolia and EVENITY, contributing to overall revenue growth. Amgen continued to increase the market share for cholesterol drug Repatha (a catalyst we had originally identified), delivering record quarterly sales as the drug’s usage expands with high-risk patients who have not yet had a cardiovascular event, and as barriers for prescribers, healthcare systems and patients are removed. In addition, we believe the company is poised to gain market share with its biosimilars (akin to generic versions of biologic drugs), also a previously identified catalyst. Biosimilars accounted for over $2 billion in revenue in 2021, and we believe this has the potential to more than double by the end of the decade, accelerated by six additional biosimilars (for a total of 11 products on the market). This includes the upcoming launch in the U.S. of arthritis treatment Amjetiva in January 2023. Meanwhile, the company is advancing its robust pipeline of early- and late-stage assets, with several phase III results due this year. These developments have caused us to remain enthusiastic about Amgen’s ability to build on its decades of success developing novel treatments using biopharmaceuticals.”7. Gilead Sciences, Inc.

The analyst elaborated that the current market capitalization of Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) only covers the value of the HIV business. The company’s oncology division is expected to post annual sales of $5 billion by the end of this decade.Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) offers an annual forward dividend yield of 5.63% as of October 17. The company’s strong growth prospects have led many to see its as one of the best pharmaceutical stocks to invest in.Of the 895 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database, Gilead Sciences, Inc.

The stock trades at a low valuation relative to its current earnings because the company faces loss of exclusivity on several key drugs over the next eight years, including Revlimid, Eliquis, and Opdivo.At the same time, Bristol-Myers has multiple new products in the early stages of launch (e.g., Opdualag, Camzyos, Breyanzi, and Reblozyl), a robust new product pipeline (e.g., Deucravacitinib, Milvexian, and CELMoD agents), and a strong balance sheet combined with strong free cash flow generation that the company can use for acquisitions. Management believes these growth drivers can more than offset the loss of exclusivity and drive revenue growth through the end of the decade. Given the company’s low valuation, if the company can execute, we think there is substantial upside in the stock.”In addition to Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY), companies like Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) are among the best pharmaceutical stocks in the industry. Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Drug Stocks to Buy Now. Suggested Articles:15 Best Gambling Stocks To BuyBest Asian Stocks To Buy11 Best Big Data Stocks To Invest InDisclose.

195,3dbd94a0-652c-318d-b66c-b3a3f85863d8,MRK,2022-10-20,Merck's (NYSE:MRK) five-year earnings growth trails the decent shareholder returns,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mercks-nyse-mrk-five-earnings-130317904.html,1666184597,STORY,['MRK'],"[Generally speaking the aim of active stock picking is to find companies that provide returns that are superior to the market average. And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. To wit, the Merck share price has climbed 50% in five years, easily topping the market return of 39% (ignoring dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 23% in the last year , including dividends .Since the stock has added US$9.0b to its market cap in the past week alone, let's see if underlying performance has been driving long-term returns. Check out our latest analysis for Merck In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, Merck achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 29% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 8% average annual increase in the share price. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Merck has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Merck, it has a TSR of 84% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Merck shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 23% over one year. That's including the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 13% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

(MRK): Here is What You Need to Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-merck-co-130001834.html,1666184401,STORY,['MRK'],"[Merck (MRK) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this pharmaceutical company have returned +10%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which Merck falls in, has gained 1.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Merck is expected to post earnings of $1.68 per share, indicating a change of -4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.5% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $7.31 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +21.4%. This estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.21 indicates a change of -1.3% from what Merck is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Merck is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Merck, the consensus sales estimate of $14.19 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +7.9%. The $58.74 billion and $58.26 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +17.1% and -0.8%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMerck reported revenues of $14.59 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +28%. EPS of $1.87 for the same period compares with $1.31 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.85 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.36%. The EPS surprise was +11.98%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Merck is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Merck. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

200,c1c1a273-5dbf-3d1a-b603-1f6cbd5d2a92,BA,2022-10-20,Boeing wins support in push to extend MAX certification timetable,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boeing-wins-support-push-extend-000806450.html,1666224486,STORY,['BA'],"[By David ShepardsonSPARTANBURG, S.C (Reuters) - Boeing Co won support Wednesday from a Republican senator and a major customer in its bid to convince the U.S. Congress to extend the deadline to win certification of two new 737 MAX variants.The U.S. planemaker faces a late December deadline for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to certify the MAX 7 and MAX 10. After that date, all planes must have modern cockpit alerting systems to be certified by the FAA, which would mean significant delays for the new MAX aircrafts' deployment, unless Congress grants a waiver to extend the deadline.Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told Reuters he supports attaching a MAX deadline waiver to a spending bill or another measure before Congress.""We're going to fight as hard as we can to get Boeing the opportunity to prove that the plane works and it does work,"" Graham said on the sidelines of an event.The requirements were approved by Congress in late 2020 as part of FAA certification reforms after two fatal 737 MAX crashes killed 346 people and led to the bestselling plane's 20-month grounding.Earlier Wednesday, United Airlines Chief Executive Scott Kirby also backed the extension, saying it makes sense to have a common 737 alerting system. ""It's a right safety outcome,"" Kirby told CNBC. ""Changing the cockpit is a bad safety outcome.""United in 2017 ordered 100 MAX 10s. Without an extension United would convert some orders to MAX 8 and 9s, Kirby said, ""and we're going to buy more Airbus 321 airplanes,"" which would impact Boeing's U.S. workers.""We should all be rooting for Boeing,"" Kirby added, citing its impact on the U.S. economy and exports.Earlier this month, Senator Roger Wicker unsuccessfully sought to attach an extension of the requirements through September 2024 to a defense bill.Pilots are split, with the union representing Southwest Airlines pilots in support and the union representing American Airlines pilots opposed.Story continuesFamilies of some MAX crash victims are also opposed as is C.B. ""Sully"" Sullenberger, who rose to fame in 2009 as a commercial pilot who safely landed an Airbus A320 on New York's Hudson River after hitting a flock of geese. FAA ""must require the installation of modern crew alerting systems,"" Sullenberger said Friday.Even with a waiver, it is uncertain when MAX planes could be approved.The FAA in an Oct. 12 letter said some key documents Boeing submitted in the agency's ongoing review of the MAX 7 are incomplete, while Boeing does not anticipate winning approval for the MAX 10 before next summer.(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Sam Holmes)]"

The stock outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.67%. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.33%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.25%.Heading into today, shares of the airplane builder had lost 5.89% over the past month, lagging the Aerospace sector's gain of 0.99% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 3.76% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Boeing as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be October 26, 2022. The company is expected to report EPS of -$0.09, up 85% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $18.27 billion, up 19.55% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of -$2.05 per share and revenue of $71.55 billion, which would represent changes of +78.28% and +14.88%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Boeing. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 5.13% lower. Boeing is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The Aerospace - Defense industry is part of the Aerospace sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 144, which puts it in the bottom 43% of all 250+ industries.Story continuesThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boeing-ba-report-negative-earnings-140102849.html,1666188062,STORY,['BA'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Boeing (BA) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 26. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis airplane builder is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.09 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +85%.Revenues are expected to be $18.27 billion, up 19.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 10.11% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Boeing?For Boeing, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Boeing will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Boeing would post a loss of $0.08 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.37, delivering a surprise of -362.50%.The company has not been able to beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Boeing doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:ILMN), a global leader in DNA sequencing and array-based technologies, and GenoScreen, an innovative genomics company, announced a partnership to accelerate progress to end tuberculosis (TB) worldwide. The partnership will expand capabilities for countries most impacted by tuberculosis to more effectively detect and combat multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). This alliance will enable global access to a package combining Illumina sequencing products and the GenoScreen Deeplex® Myc-TB assay, a targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) based test for rapid and extensive detection of anti-TB drug resistance, to promptly inform treatment decision. This will help advance the World Health Organization's (WHO) strategy to end the global TB epidemic by 2035.""Through our partnership, we will enable lower-income countries to confront the pervasive threat of TB and work toward eliminating it,"" said Phil Febbo, chief medical officer of Illumina. ""The COVID-19 pandemic response led to expanded NGS capacity around the world, so now institutions have the platforms needed to support testing for TB drug resistance and improve survival for patients with TB, the leading infectious disease killer prior to COVID.""According to the WHO, TB is the first worldwide bacterial infectious killer, claiming over 1.5 million lives each year. And even though TB can be cured when appropriately treated, MDR-TB represents a global public health emergency. In 2019, an estimated 465,000 people developed TB with rifampicin resistance (RR) or MDR, yet only 40% of these cases were detected and enrolled on MDR-TB treatment. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, deaths from TB increased for the first time in a decade.""As a world specialist in TB genomic solutions, we envision this partnership with Illumina as an accelerator for the global deployment of our Deeplex Myc-TB assay, especially for countries with the highest needs,"" said André Tordeux, CEO of GenoScreen.Story continuesStandard culture-based testing methods currently incur turnaround times of up to two months, and conventional molecular assays are limited in identifying drug resistance. The combined use of the GenoScreen Deeplex Myc-TB assay and the Illumina NGS platforms allows much more rapid determination of extensive drug resistance profiles and TB strain types affecting patients.The Deeplex Myc-TB assay, developed and produced by GenoScreen since 2019, uses a culture-free approach to identify TB mycobacteria and more than 100 non-TB mycobacterial species, and to predict resistance to 15 antibiotics, in 24 to 48 hours-directly from primary respiratory samples. The Deeplex web application for automated analysis of the sequencing data enables clinicians to easily interpret the results and best define personalized treatments.""The Deeplex Myc-TB kit is the most comprehensive commercial molecular test for detection of anti-TB-drug resistance available to date,"" said Philip Supply, research director at the French National Centre for Scientific Research. ""We are continually updating the technology to detect emerging resistance to the newest anti-TB drugs.""Implementing NGS testing will also benefit national TB programs around the world by providing critical surveillance data about resistance to different anti-TB drugs-important information for high-burden countries to guide TB control strategies.Use of forward-looking statementsThis release may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Among the important factors to which Illumina's business is subject that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in any forward-looking statements are challenges inherent in developing, manufacturing, and launching new products and services, and Illumina's ability to successfully partner with other companies and organizations to develop new products, expand markets, and grow its business, together with other factors detailed in Illumina's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its most recent filings on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, or in information disclosed in public conference calls, the date and time of which are released beforehand.

But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. For example, the Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI) share price is up 72% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 22% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 45% in the last year , including dividends .Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. See our latest analysis for Cigna To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During three years of share price growth, Cigna achieved compound earnings per share growth of 15% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 20% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did three years ago. It is quite common to see investors become enamoured with a business, after a few years of solid progress.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Cigna, it has a TSR of 78% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Cigna has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 45% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 9% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Cigna better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should be aware of the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Cigna .We will like Cigna better if we see some big insider buys.

(NASDAQ:SWKS)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-skyworks-solutions-inc-nasdaq-160837043.html,1666195717,STORY,['SWKS'],"[Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$114 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$79.38. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Skyworks Solutions' current trading price of US$81.89 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Skyworks Solutions’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for Skyworks Solutions What Is Skyworks Solutions Worth?According to my price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average, the stock price seems to be justfied. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Skyworks Solutions’s ratio of 10.11x is trading slightly below its industry peers’ ratio of 14.28x, which means if you buy Skyworks Solutions today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe Skyworks Solutions should be trading in this range, then there isn’t much room for the share price to grow beyond the levels of other industry peers over the long-term. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Skyworks Solutions’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from Skyworks Solutions?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Skyworks Solutions' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 34%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in SWKS’s positive outlook, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at SWKS? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuate below the industry PE ratio?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on SWKS, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for SWKS, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

Hydrogen-electric propulsion technology can produce 90% less lifecycle emissions than jet fuel-powered turbines, and ZeroAvia predicts its powertrain will result in substantially lower operating costs.Ansys solutions enable development and certification of ZeroAvia's hydrogen-electric powertrain for aircraft that emits only water. Image credit: ZeroAvia.A leader in sustainable aviation, ZeroAvia demonstrated the potential for zero-emission flight through flying the world's largest hydrogen-electric powered aircraft, a Piper Malibu. ZeroAvia engineers leveraged Ansys multiphysics simulations — including structural analysis, fluid dynamics, FSI, electromagnetic, and electromechanical analysis — to help make this electric-powered plane a reality. The ZeroAvia system uses electricity generated by a solar panel to run an air compression pump. When combined with hydrogen stored in an on-board tank, oxygen from the compressed air reacts with hydrogen in the fuel cell to produce electricity to power an electric airplane motor. Water is the only emission from this process — no carbon-based greenhouse gases.The ZeroAvia team used Ansys® SCADE®  to automatically generate the code controlling the motor, which helps reduce human error and costly coding mistakes. ZeroAvia also leveraged Ansys® medini analyze software to validate the safety of the aircraft's hydro-electric systems – supporting and accelerating the stringent certification process.Story continues""Without Ansys, we would still be writing code for high-level application, which would have increased the development and verification,"" said Youcef Abdelli, chief technology officer and chief engineer of electric propulsion systems at ZeroAvia.

(VFC) Q2 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-v-f-vfc-140102148.html,1666188062,STORY,['VFC'],"[The market expects V.F. (VFC) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 26. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis maker of brands such as Vans, North Face and Timberland is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.74 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -33.3%.Revenues are expected to be $3.1 billion, down 3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 8.92% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for V.F.For V.F.The Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #5.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that V.F. Will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that V.F. Would post earnings of $0.13 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.09, delivering a surprise of -30.77%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.V.F. Doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With 82% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Institutional investors would appreciate the 5.7% increase in share prices last week, given their one-year returns have been disappointing at 16%.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Zions Bancorporation National Association. Check out our latest analysis for Zions Bancorporation National Association ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Zions Bancorporation National Association?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Zions Bancorporation National Association does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Zions Bancorporation National Association's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Zions Bancorporation National Association. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 13%. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 6.6% and 4.8%, of the shares outstanding, respectively. Furthermore, CEO Harris Simmons is the owner of 0.9% of the company's shares.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 15 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Zions Bancorporation National AssociationThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in Zions Bancorporation, National Association. It is a pretty big company, so it is generally a positive to see some potentially meaningful alignment. In this case, they own around US$122m worth of shares (at current prices).

General Public OwnershipWith a 17% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Zions Bancorporation National Association. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company.

However, a rising expense base and weak capital ratios were headwinds.Net income was $394.8 million, marginally down year over year from $395.7 million.Revenues Climb, Costs Shoot UpTotal revenues of $1.75 billion were up 7% year over year. The top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.76 billion.NII was $513 million in the third quarter, gaining 48% year over year mainly due to a higher net interest margin (“NIM”).

With 73% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Institutional investors would probably welcome last week's 11% increase in share prices after a year of 9.4% losses as a sign that returns are likely to begin trending higher.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Wells Fargo. Check out our latest analysis for Wells Fargo ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Wells Fargo?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Wells Fargo does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Wells Fargo, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Wells Fargo. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.5% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.0% and 4.2% of the stock.Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Story continuesWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Wells FargoWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Wells Fargo &amp; Company in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$125m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 26% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Wells Fargo , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do.

Further, the top line beat the consensus estimate of $961.5 million.NII increased 48.8% on a year-over-year basis to $707 million. Net interest margin (NIM) rose 127 basis points (bps) year over year to 3.50%.Total non-interest income was $278 million, down 1% on a year-over-year basis. The decrease was due to a fall in card fees, commercial lending fees and other non-interest income.Non-interest expenses totaled $502 million, up 8% year over year. The rise was due to an increase in salaries and benefits expenses, occupancy expenses, FDIC insurance expenses and other non-interest expenses.The efficiency ratio was 50.75% compared with the prior-year quarter’s 61.13%. A decrease in the ratio indicates higher profitability.Balance Sheet Position RobustAs of Sep 30, 2022, total assets and shareholders' equity were $84.14 billion and $5.07 billion, respectively, compared with $86.89 billion and $6.44 billion, as of Jun 30, 2022.Total loans increased marginally on a sequential basis to $51.71 billion.

A provision for credit losses of $28 million was recorded in the reported quarter against a benefit of $42 million in the prior-year quarter.Story continuesCapital Position WeakensAs of Sep 30, 2022, CMA's tangible common equity ratio was 4.82%, down from 7.20% in the prior-year quarter. The total capital ratio was 12.40%, declining from 12.57% in the year-ago quarter.Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio was 9.92%, falling from 10.27% in the prior-year quarter.Our ViewpointGradually improving loan commitments and higher interest rates are expected to continue to support NII and margin growth in the near term.

227,3e9fdfcd-6284-4562-9c65-8905425c60ac,PFE,2022-10-20,FDA greenlights Novavax's original COVID-19 vaccine as booster,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fda-greenlights-novavaxs-original-covid-19-vaccine-as-booster-192355887.html,1666207435,STORY,"['MRNA', 'PFE', 'NVAX', 'BNTX']","[The FDA and CDC greenlit Novavax's (NVAX) original COVID-19 vaccine for use as a booster in some adults, marking the first monovalent vaccine to receive authorization as a booster against the latest Omicron variants.The authorization specifies that adults who have not yet received a bivalent booster but have completed their primary vaccine series can received the Novavax dose at least six months after their last shot.That includes if their primary doses were mRNA and if an mRNA bivalent booster is not available or clinically appropriate, according to the FDA.Novavax chief commercial officer John Trizzino told Yahoo Finance that the company is already working on clinical trial data that it hopes will amend the emergency use authorization (EUA) to include the option for use as a second booster.""The data that we submitted was exclusively for the first boost dose. Now, logically, you would think that if you're good enough to be the first heterologous boost then you should be good enough to do a second heterologous boost ... but they wanted to see additional data,"" Trizzino said of the FDA.He said he doesn't have a timeline for when that second boost data will be available, however.About 20% of the adult population has yet to receive any vaccine for COVID and at least 50% have not received a booster, Trizzino said.While mRNA doses have been available for second boosters since September, uptake has been slow.As of last week, about 5% of the eligible population has received an additional booster. Older adults are doing better, with about 40% of adults over the age of 50 and 46% of adults over 65 having received their second doses, according to the CDC.That's where Novavax sees market opportunity, according to Trizzino.""There's still significant opportunity there for those people that want to get another vaccine,"" he said.Different rulesBy comparison, mRNA second boosters were required to be bivalent shots with against the BA.4/BA.5 Omicron subvariants, which were the dominant strains in the summer.Story continuesAt a meeting in June, the FDA determined that the vaccine companies, including Moderna (MRNA) and Pfizer/BioNTech (PFE/BNTX), needed to reformulate in order to provide the best possible protection. Both mRNA vaccines have since been authorized as second boosters, and the original formulas are no longer allowed to be used for boosters, the FDA said. And the companies have only just released data about the efficacy of the new shots — which were approved without clinical data.Those boosters have no limitations because the potential for a mix and match with a primary Novavax recipient is low.""We're being held to a different and higher standard,"" Trizzino said.But that doesn't mean Novavax's vaccine will not be used as a second booster.""What a health care provider chooses to do is up to a health care provider,"" Trizzino said.Stock under pressureDespite the news, the company's stock remained under pressure Wednesday.It has been down from the highs of 2021, as firms like JPMorgan have expressed doubt about the company's future.That's something Trizzino said the company is acutely aware of.""I think that the doubts are in overall kind of market size —What does the investment community think about the what the COVID market will be going forward? Will it continue to shrink aggressively? Will people get vaccinated? There's a variety of opinions about what the global Covid market will be,"" he said.Novavax isn't the first COVID vaccine company to see a split between regulatory news and stock movement. Pfizer's CEO had been similarly frustrated by the investment community's reaction to its vaccine even after record sales.Trizzino said the difference is that now people are more complacent about the virus, and another surge — like the one experts are anxious about striking this winter — could trigger more vaccinations.""I think the investment community, as far as Novavax is concerned, wants to see what the rest of the year looks like. I think there's some doubt ... about what the total global COVID marketplace looks like into the future,"" Trizzino said.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhemRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance.Follow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube.]"

None of us is blame-free in this environment of ever-increasing health care costs,"" SCAN Group &amp; Health Plan CEO Dr. Sachin Jain told Yahoo Finance at the 2022 All Markets Summit.As an example of increasing costs, Jain pointed to Pfizer (PFE) CEO Albert Bourla's comments to Yahoo Finance about raising prices for COVID-19 vaccines. Pfizer confirmed a recent report that the vaccines, which had been sold at under $20 per dose previously, could be sold anywhere between $22 to $42 in 2023.""We have to take a hard look at what companies are doing, why they are doing it, and holding them accountable ... to ensure that patients are protected. Because what I see time and time again is a lot of rhetoric that doesn't necessarily match the action of health care organizations,"" Jain said.WASHINGTON, DC - OCTOBER 06: Activists protest the price of prescription drug costs in front of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) building on October 06, 2022 in Washington, DC. The demonstration was sponsored by the Make Meds Affordable campaign, which is calling on Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra to take executive action to lower drug prices. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)Even with increased investments in community partners and other equity strategies — which groups like America's Health Insurance Plans compile to showcase the industry's ongoing efforts — the combined impact can hardly be felt, Jain said.""We've got organizations that have historically not necessarily given priority to these topics. You see a lot of talk ... coming from across the health care industries. Entities that are saying that they believe in health equity, saying that they believe in disparities reductions. But when you actually look at the real investments that they are making, they're small, and they're insignificant in the context of the broader challenges we face as a society,"" Jain said.And more organizations need leaders willing to put in real investments, he added. ""More than just the window dressing.""The industry has long found ways to justify higher costs, or engage in the blame game of pointing fingers at other sectors. Doctors blame pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) for high costs and lack of access to drugs, drug companies also point to the PBMs saying they take too much of a cut and don't pass on the rebates they receive for favorable listing positions in formularies. Hospitals blame medical device companies and equipment manufacturers. The list goes on.Story continuesEven mission-oriented companies and non-profits share the blame, Jain said.""What we often see is mission-oriented organizations hiding behind the rhetoric of 'no margin, no mission,'"" he said, adding that it helps the industry feel justified in its profit-seeking behaviors.""But ultimately (it) ignores the fact that the mission isn't organizational sustainability;"" the mission is public and community health, Jain said.SCAN has seen real results. For example, SCAN helped reduce disparities in vaccinations among Black, LatinX and low income individuals in the states it operates in. From February through August 2021, the gap between Black and white members reduced from 17% to 6%.SCAN also recently launched an LGBTQ+ plan in four states that targets the group's specific needs and focuses on providing a health network that older LGBTQ individuals. The idea, Jain said, is to provide an increasingly tech-savvy older population with the tools they need to live healthier lives and address needs that have been exacerbated from when these individuals were younger and living in a less progressive world.But how can the industry as a whole create results?""I think we've gotten confused over the last number of decades and health care has evolved into this new normal where every sector of health care is trying to extract as much as it can,"" Jain said.""And it's frankly unsustainable, and it's unethical,"" he added.And now, with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which will lower drug prices and enhance Medicare benefits, Jain sees an opportunity for the industry to find its way out of misaligned incentives.""I think there's this interesting moment in time where there's an alignment of business interests as well as doing the right thing from a social justice perspective,"" Jain said.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhemRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance.Follow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube.]"

Viatris Inc. (NASDAQ:VTRS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50Viatris Inc. (NASDAQ:VTRS) is a Canonsburg, Pennsylvania-based drug corporation.Viatris Inc. (NASDAQ:VTRS) is looking into offloading its $2.9 billion European consumer healthcare business. The division responsible for manufacturing over-the-counter (OTC) drugs could gain the attention of leading private equity firms and other consumer healthcare companies that are interested in creating synergies and experiencing growth in the region. Viatris Inc. (NASDAQ:VTRS) is following the trend of spinning off the consumer healthcare segment to increase focus on the pharmaceutical side of the business.Based on a number of aspects, Viatris Inc.

At the company level, we hold select companies in pharmaceuticals, healthcare services and health insurance at attractive valuations. This is at a time when the average age of the U.S. population is fast approaching 40, older than Asia-Pacific and a little younger than the aged populations of Europe and Japan. The number of seniors in the U.S.—i.e., 65 years or older— now surpasses 54 million, or about 15% of the population. Seniors, on average, take a much greater number of medications and account for a large and disproportionate share of healthcare spending, and we expect that trend to continue due to both raw demographics and a proliferation in the number of available treatments and services available now, the latter being driven by innovation and investment in the healthcare industry. Representative holdings in the Fund include Cigna, United Health Group, Viatris and Quest Diagnostics.”9. Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 54Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) is a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotechnology company that is focused on finding treatments for neurological diseases.On October 12, Paul Matteis at Stifel upgraded Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) stock from a Hold to a Buy rating and increased the target price from $223 to $299. Biogen Inc.’s (NASDAQ:BIIB) share price has been on an upward trend following the disclosure of the positive data for lecanemab, with very few concerns related to competitive and commercial risks. The analyst thinks that the risk and reward profile of Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) stock is skewed towards the reward side.Longleaf Partners Fund shared its stance on Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB)  in its Q4 2021 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“Biogen (83%, 2.43%; 5%, 0.10%), a biotechnology company specializing in therapies for the treatment of neurological diseases, was a strong contributor before we exited the position in the first half. We began acquiring shares in January 2021, paying between 9- 11x FCF and a discount to our appraisal, even if the company’s promising drug pipeline turned out to be worth 0. After Biogen’s Alzheimer drug Aduhelm was approved in June, we quickly sold out after the stock’s price appreciated over 70% and briefly exceeded our appraisal of the value. We re-initiated a position in Biogen in December at a price below our original cost basis from January. The stock became very cheap once again after Aduhelm’s early sales disappointed due to its high initial cost before management correctly cut the price. We think Biogen’s core Multiple sclerosis (MS) and Biosimilars businesses are strong enough to create sustainable double-digit EPS growth, even if Aduhelm and the entire Alzheimer’s program is worth zero. We also expect a board led by large shareholders to continue the company’s accretive repurchase, while considering other beneficial corporate actions.”8. Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) is a Thousand Oaks, California-based biotechnology company.On October 11, Matthew Harrison at Morgan Stanley upgraded Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) stock from an Equal Weight to an Overweight rating and also increased the target price from $279 to $257. Given the potential of the medium-term drug pipeline of the company, the analyst thinks Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) is amongst the best pharmaceutical stocks to invest in. Harrison believes that in the current macroeconomic environment, Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) offers a defensive positioning with an attractive long-term upside potential based on the outlook of the AMG133 for obesity care and the launch of biosimilar Amjevita.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Aristotle Capital Management shared its insights on Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN). Here’s what the firm said:“Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN), the pharmaceutical company focused on biotechnology-based therapeutics, was also a top contributor for the quarter. The company reported solid results, with a variety of products, such as bone-strengthening drugs Prolia and EVENITY, contributing to overall revenue growth. Amgen continued to increase the market share for cholesterol drug Repatha (a catalyst we had originally identified), delivering record quarterly sales as the drug’s usage expands with high-risk patients who have not yet had a cardiovascular event, and as barriers for prescribers, healthcare systems and patients are removed. In addition, we believe the company is poised to gain market share with its biosimilars (akin to generic versions of biologic drugs), also a previously identified catalyst. Biosimilars accounted for over $2 billion in revenue in 2021, and we believe this has the potential to more than double by the end of the decade, accelerated by six additional biosimilars (for a total of 11 products on the market). This includes the upcoming launch in the U.S. of arthritis treatment Amjetiva in January 2023. Meanwhile, the company is advancing its robust pipeline of early- and late-stage assets, with several phase III results due this year. These developments have caused us to remain enthusiastic about Amgen’s ability to build on its decades of success developing novel treatments using biopharmaceuticals.”7. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) is a Foster City, California-based pharmaceutical company focused on developing antiviral drugs.Chris Schott at JPMorgan upgraded Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) stock from a Neutral to an Overweight rating on October 4. The analyst also increased the target price from $72 to $80. Schott highlighted that the current valuation of Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) does not truly reflect the higher visibility of the HIV division and the rising oncology division of the business. The analyst elaborated that the current market capitalization of Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) only covers the value of the HIV business. The company’s oncology division is expected to post annual sales of $5 billion by the end of this decade.Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) offers an annual forward dividend yield of 5.63% as of October 17. The company’s strong growth prospects have led many to see its as one of the best pharmaceutical stocks to invest in.Of the 895 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database, Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) was held by 58 hedge funds as of Q2 2022.6. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) is a New York-based biopharmaceutical company that has seen a significant surge in revenue and earnings following the acquisition of cancer specialist Celgene and cardiology company MyoKardia. The company has also been focusing on internal operations to expand its drug portfolio.Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) holds a leading position in the field of oncology and works actively to enhance its presence in the fields of cardiovascular and immunological diseases. Experts believe that the company’s clinical and regulatory execution has been solid this year as it received approval for multiple drugs, namely Camzyos, Opdualag, and Sotyktu. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) is investing heavily in research and development for its Phase- III trials. Analysts think Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) is amongst the best pharmaceutical stocks as the stock offers considerable upside in the long run.Here’s what Baron Funds said about Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“We established a position in Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, a global biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing, and selling medicines for patients in the therapeutic areas of oncology, immunology, cardiovascular, and neurology. The stock trades at a low valuation relative to its current earnings because the company faces loss of exclusivity on several key drugs over the next eight years, including Revlimid, Eliquis, and Opdivo.At the same time, Bristol-Myers has multiple new products in the early stages of launch (e.g., Opdualag, Camzyos, Breyanzi, and Reblozyl), a robust new product pipeline (e.g., Deucravacitinib, Milvexian, and CELMoD agents), and a strong balance sheet combined with strong free cash flow generation that the company can use for acquisitions. Management believes these growth drivers can more than offset the loss of exclusivity and drive revenue growth through the end of the decade. Given the company’s low valuation, if the company can execute, we think there is substantial upside in the stock.”In addition to Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY), companies like Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) are among the best pharmaceutical stocks in the industry. Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Drug Stocks to Buy Now. Suggested Articles:15 Best Gambling Stocks To BuyBest Asian Stocks To Buy11 Best Big Data Stocks To Invest InDisclose.

People are living longer, so that money has to cover a longer period. Making matters worse, income generated using tried-and-true retirement planning approaches may not cover expenses these days. That means seniors must dip into principal to meet living expenses.In today's economic environment, traditional income investments are not working.For example, 10-year Treasury bonds in the late 1990s offered a yield of around 6.50%, which translated to an income source you could count on. However, today's yield is much lower and probably not a viable return option to fund typical retirements.The impact of this rate decline is sizable: over 20 years, the difference in yield for a $1 million investment in 10-year Treasuries is more than $1 million.In addition to the considerable drop in bond yields, today's retirees are nervous about their future Social Security benefits. Because of certain demographic factors, it's been estimated that the funds that pay the Social Security benefits will run out of money in 2035.So what's a retiree to do? You could cut your expenses to the bone, and take the risk that your Social Security checks don't shrink. Or you could find an alternative investment that provides a steady, higher-rate income stream to replace dwindling bond yields.Invest in Dividend StocksDividend-paying stocks from low-risk, high-quality companies are a smart way to generate steady and reliable attractive income streams to replace low risk, low yielding Treasury and bond options.Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.Going beyond those familiar names, you can find excellent dividend-paying stocks by following a few guidelines. Look for companies that pay a dividend yield of around 3%, with positive annual dividend growth. The growth rate is key to help combat the effects of inflation.Story continuesHere are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.Conagra Brands (CAG) is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.33 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.78%. This compares to the Food - Miscellaneous industry's yield of 0% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.77%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 5.6%. Check Conagra Brands (CAG) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Pfizer (PFE) is paying out a dividend of $0.4 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.63% compared to the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry's yield of 2.76% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 2.56% over the past year. Check Pfizer (PFE) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $0.97 per share, Phillips 66 (PSX) has a dividend yield of 4.04%. This is compared to the Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry's yield of 1.7% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 7.78%. Check Phillips 66 (PSX) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?It is true that stocks, as an asset class, carry more risk than bonds, but high-quality dividend stocks not only have the ability to produce income growth over time but more importantly, can also reduce your overall portfolio volatility relative to the broader stock market.An upside to adding dividend stocks to your retirement portfolio: they can help lessen the effects of inflation, since many dividend-paying companies (especially blue chip stocks) generally increase their dividends over time.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.If you prefer investing in funds or ETFs compared to individual stocks, you can still pursue a dividend income strategy. However, it's important to know the fees charged by each fund or ETF, which can ultimately reduce your dividend income, working against your strategy. Do your homework and make sure you know the fees charged by any fund before you invest.Bottom LineWhether you select high-quality, low-fee funds or stocks, seeking the steady income of dividend-paying equities can potentially offer you a path to a better and more stress-free retirement.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

232,0151b896-6356-31cb-94a2-16864cc01ebc,PFE,2022-10-20,10 Dividend Stocks to Buy Amid the Market Decline,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-dividend-stocks-buy-amid-130059215.html,1666184459,STORY,"['KO', 'PFE', 'PEP', 'PG', 'ABBV']","[In this article, we will take a look at 10 dividend stocks to buy amid the market decline. If you want to see some more high quality dividend stocks, go directly to 5 Dividend Stocks to Buy Amid the Market Decline.Like many other stocks in 2022, many dividend stocks have fallen substantially this year. The Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF, which seeks to track the performance of large cap equity stocks emphasizing stocks with a record of growing dividends year over year, has fallen 17.73% year to date as of 10/17.One reason for the decline is the five Federal Reserve rate hikes this year. With the rate hikes, risk free Treasuries are yielding more than before. While the 10 year Treasury yield was 1.512% at the end of last year, the yield is now 3.99% as of 10/17. As a result of higher Treasury yields, stocks with the same dividend yields as before the rate hikes are less attractive to many buyers.There is potential for more rate hikes in the future. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in September, “My main message has not changed since Jackson Hole. The FOMC is strongly resolved to bring inflation down to 2%, and we will keep at it until the job is done.” Currently core inflation is at 6.6%, which is a 40 year high.Given the rapid rate of the rate hikes, there is also a potential for a recession next year, which some economists estimate to be around a 60% probability. Other economists estimate an even higher probability for a recession.Given the interest rate and economic headwinds, many dividend stocks have fallen substantially. The S&amp;P 500 index has also fallen 23% year to date and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is comprised of larger cap stocks than the S&amp;P 500, is down around 17.5% year to date.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for investors to have a well diversified portfolio of stocks across different sectors. While there is potential for even more downside in the dividend sector if economic data fails to meet expectations, there could also be opportunities for long term investors who buy quality dividend stocks.Story continuesIn terms of some of the dividend stocks we think are worthy of consideration, here are 10:15 fastest growing dividend stocksCopyright: netsay / 123RF Stock PhotoMethodologyFor our list of 10 Dividend Stocks to Buy Amid the Market Decline, we picked 10 stocks with dividend yields of over 2% as of 10/17 that we think have the right mix of value and growth for long term investors. Using the collective wisdom of hedge funds, we then ranked the 10 based on the number of hedge fund holders that held shares in each stock at the end of Q2 2022.10 Dividend Stocks to Buy Amid the Market Decline10. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Dividend Yield as of 10/17: 3.16%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a high quality dividend stock given its dividend yield of 3.16% as of 10/17 as well as its 60 consecutive years of raising its annual dividend. Given the market decline, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) now trades at a forward P/E ratio of 21.75, which could be attractive in the long term given the company's high quality earnings.Aristotle Capital commented on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q2 2022 letter earlier in the year,“The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), the global beverage business, was a leading contributor for the period. Coca-Cola continues to benefit from the refranchising of its bottling operations and realignment of incentives, catalysts we previously identified. These initiatives are demonstrating their strength in an inflationary and supply-chain-challenged environment. Additionally, the company has focused on evolving its customer engagement practices by leveraging digital and social medias for targeted campaigns, such as the design and launch of Coke Byte in the metaverse. Lastly, Coca-Cola has furthered its transformation into a total beverage company, as it debuted its new Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey and Coca-Cola ready-to-drink premixed cocktail. Although uncertainties surrounding cost pressures, lockdowns and geopolitical conflicts remain, we believe Coca-Cola is uniquely positioned to successfully continue its transition toward a total beverage business.”Of the 895 hedge funds in our database, 60 owned shares of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) at the end of the second quarter.Alongside Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

242,24565fc1-b64c-36e6-ba82-d8cbc719be67,IBM,2022-10-20,IBM Gains After Sales Top Estimates Amid Currency Headwinds,Bloomberg,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ibm-sales-top-estimates-even-200928330.html,1666216094,STORY,['IBM'],"[(Bloomberg) -- International Business Machines Corp. reported better-than-expected sales and affirmed its cash flow forecast in a sign that demand for software, mainframe computers and hybrid cloud services remain steady.Most Read from BloombergRenters Hit Breaking Point in a Sudden Reversal for LandlordsChina Stocks Slide as Leadership Overhaul Disappoints TradersAdidas to End Kanye West Partnership After ControversiesKorean Air Plane Overruns Runway While Landing in PhilippinesDove, Other Unilever Dry Shampoos Recalled Over Cancer RiskSales rose 6.5% to $14.1 billion in the third quarter, the Armonk, New York-based company said Wednesday in a statement. Analysts, on average, estimated $13.5 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. IBM expects full-year revenue growth will exceed the company’s previous mid-single digit guidance while free cash flow will hit the estimate of $10 billion.The shares climbed about 4% in extended trading after closing at $122.51 in New York. IBM has been a relative safe haven in the tech market meltdown, falling only 8.3% this year compared with a 36% loss for the iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF.IBM’s resilience comes from its focus on mission-critical services for businesses, Chief Executive Officer Arvind Krishna said on a call with analysts after the results were released. Looking forward, Krishna said demand for information technology in the Americas and Asia is “very robust,” while energy price volatility and inflation in Europe could result in “a bit of a downturn.”Though Krishna is betting IBM’s future growth on the lucrative market for cloud computing and artificial intelligence, mainframe sales helped its infrastructure unit generate a 15% increase in revenue -- the fastest-growing division in the quarter. A new model should support mainframe sales through at least the first half of next year, Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan wrote in a note ahead of earnings.Software sales jumped 7.5% to $5.8 billion, while consulting gained 5.4% to $4.7 billion. Revenue produced by Red Hat, the acquired division that has been a key part of Krishna’s turnaround strategy, increased 12%, another comparatively slow quarter for a unit that has regularly posted growth of more than 20% since the 2019 purchase.Story continuesThe figures indicate steady IT spending, but “given persistent pressure in the global economic environment, we expect to see some deceleration in these segments,” wrote Bloomberg Intelligence’s Anurag Rana after the results.Big Blue’s internationally skewed sales continue to be damped by a historically strong US dollar. The company said currency fluctuations cut its third-quarter revenue by 9 percentage points and would slice full-year growth by about 7 percentage points.The strong dollar is impacting margins and the company has responded by increasing prices for products and consulting, Chief Financial Officer Jim Kavanaugh said in an interview. Gross margin was 52.7% in the period ended Sept. 30, more than 2 percentage points below analysts’ average estimate. IBM has spent more than $1 billion on acquisitions this year, which has been “more than offset by proceeds from the vested businesses,” Kavanaugh said on the call.Earnings, excluding some items, was $1.81 a share in the quarter, in line with estimates.

Perhaps the roar ahead of 3-4% going back from five trading days ago was due for a trim. The Dow closed -0.32%, the S&amp;P 500 was -0.61% and the Nasdaq -0.85%. The Russell 2000 saw a more significant sell-off on the day, -1.72%.Quickly, the 10-year Treasury bond yield, which breached 4% yesterday, ramped up to +4.127% today. The 2-year, which had already surpassed this psychological level weeks ago, accelerated to +4.554% today. Consider the Fed funds rate, currently at 3-3.25%: at its next monetary policy meeting, its nearly unanimous that another 75 basis-point (bps) hike, which would bring us to 3.75-4%. These bond yields are now “forecasting” another 50-75 bps hike at the Fed’s December meeting. Worth keeping in mind.Long-awaited Q3 earnings figures for Tesla TSLA are out after today’s closing bell, posting a mixed overall headline: earnings of $1.05 per share beat the Zacks consensus by a solid dime, while revenues in the quarter of $21.45 billion missed the expected $22.32 billion. Operating cash flow in the quarter reached $3.3 billion; operating margin came in at 17.2%.Today’s conference call is likely to be discussing weakness in Tesla’s China market — the company’s largest operating venue, but one that has been marred by Covid shutdowns and subsequent economic anemia. Also, for the first time, we may hear CEO Elon Musk field questions related to his pending purchase of Twitter TWTR, and whether he would be required to sell more shares of Tesla to finalize that deal.Tesla saw a +30% increase in gross margins including emissions credits, but only +26.8% without those credits — below what analysts were expecting. This may explain the -6% sell-off of Tesla shares in late trading (but ahead of the conference call), which now puts the vaunted EV leader -50%+ from its peak trading highs. Hopefully Musk will be able to soothe his investors’ fears; he’s done so several times in the past.IBM Corp. IBM also posted A# results this afternoon, and the Big Tech staple outperformed on both top and bottom lines: earnings of $1.81 per share outpaced the Zacks consensus by 3 cents — though this was downwardly guided from $1.91 per share previously — on $14.11 billion in revenues, which bettered the $13.73 billion analysts were predicting. Full-year revenue guidance was also bumped up; shares are +5% in the after-market.Las Vegas Sands LVS continues its comeback story, albeit rather slowly: a bottom-line loss of -27 cents per share was 7 cents lower than consensus, while revenues tipped the billion-scale to $1.01 billion in the quarter, above the anticipated $975 million. Its Singaporean Marina Bay Sands rebounded nicely, while results from Macau show lower losses than predicted. Shares were flat-to-low ahead of the Q3 report, and that’s where they remain at his hour.Questions or comments about this article and/or its author?

Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Waters' current trading price of US$277 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Waters’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Waters What's The Opportunity In Waters?According to my valuation model, Waters seems to be fairly priced at around 12% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Waters today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $315.80, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. What's more, Waters’s share price may be more stable over time (relative to the market), as indicated by its low beta.Can we expect growth from Waters?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by a double-digit 20% over the next couple of years, the outlook is positive for Waters. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? WAT’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on WAT, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved.

This move lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.67%. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.33%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.25%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the company had lost 12.31% over the past month. This has was narrower than the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector's loss of 18.96% and lagged the S&amp;P 500's loss of 3.76% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from General Motors Company as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be October 25, 2022. In that report, analysts expect General Motors Company to post earnings of $1.91 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 25.66%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $41.83 billion, up 56.22% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $6.71 per share and revenue of $154.01 billion. These totals would mark changes of -5.09% and +21.26%, respectively, from last year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for General Motors Company. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 1.21% lower within the past month. General Motors Company is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Story continuesDigging into valuation, General Motors Company currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 5.1. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 10.37, which means General Motors Company is trading at a discount to the group.Also, we should mention that GM has a PEG ratio of 0.52. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. Automotive - Domestic stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 0.77 based on yesterday's closing prices.The Automotive - Domestic industry is part of the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 133, putting it in the bottom 48% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

249,71b113a4-cd05-3d4b-9acf-1bbf239e1b5f,GM,2022-10-20,Harley-Davidson (HOG) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/harley-davidson-hog-earnings-expected-140102530.html,1666188062,STORY,"['HOG', 'GM']","[Harley-Davidson (HOG) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 26, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis motorcycle maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.45 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +38.1%.Revenues are expected to be $1.33 billion, up 14.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 9.68% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Harley-Davidson?For Harley-Davidson, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Harley-Davidson will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Harley-Davidson would post earnings of $1.21 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.46, delivering a surprise of +20.66%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Harley-Davidson doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, General Motors Company (GM) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.91 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +25.7%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $41.83 billion, up 56.2% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for General Motors Company has been revised 1.8% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -13.99%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that General Motors Company will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. Having said that, from a first glance at United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for United Airlines Holdings:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.017 = US$791m ÷ (US$69b - US$22b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).So, United Airlines Holdings has an ROCE of 1.7%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Airlines industry average of 4.9%. See our latest analysis for United Airlines Holdings roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for United Airlines Holdings compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.The Trend Of ROCEOn the surface, the trend of ROCE at United Airlines Holdings doesn't inspire confidence. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 14%, but since then they've fallen to 1.7%. However, given capital employed and revenue have both increased it appears that the business is currently pursuing growth, at the consequence of short term returns. If these investments prove successful, this can bode very well for long term stock performance.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayWhile returns have fallen for United Airlines Holdings in recent times, we're encouraged to see that sales are growing and that the business is reinvesting in its operations. And there could be an opportunity here if other metrics look good too, because the stock has declined 35% in the last five years. As a result, we'd recommend researching this stock further to uncover what other fundamentals of the business can show us.On a separate note, we've found   1 warning sign for United Airlines Holdings   you'll probably want to know about.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Netflix NFLX, Intuitive Surgical ISRG, Lockheed Martin LMT and United Airlines UAL.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:These Stocks Have Popped: Here's WhyAs the Q3 earnings season gathers momentum, investors appear to be handsomely rewarding the companies that improve their revenue and earnings, provided there are also signs of improved visibility.Here is a group of companies that were rewarded this week: Netflix shares jumped 13.8%, Intuitive Surgical 12.1%, Lockheed Martin 8.7%, and United Airlines 7.0%. Let’s see why-NetflixNetflix reported earnings of $3.10 per share that came in higher than the $2.11 estimated. Revenue came in about 1% higher than estimated.The results may have been much better if it wasn’t for the strong dollar, which significantly impacted inflows from its international business. Investors cheered the fact that memberships continued to grow even if it was mainly driven by Asia, signaling that the pandemic-related disruption was probably over.In the earnings release, management highlighted how Amazon and Disney lagged Netflix in engagement, both in the UK and the U.S. But competition is clearly heating up across geographies. Some on the street are saying that the lower-priced ad-supported plan is designed to target an increasingly competitive market. Others have argued the lack of sense in paying for a plan that comes with ads. But management remains optimistic about the launch next month. We’ll have to see how it goes.Netflix is clearly better positioned than its peers today because they are in the initial investment phase and management is probably right in guessing that they’re making huge losses.Story continuesIntuitive SurgicalIntuitive Surgical’s earnings missed estimates by 1.1% but its sales beat by 2.2%.Investors piled into the shares after management stated that the company’s business fundamentals strengthened in the third quarter, as reflected by the growth in its installed base, increases in utilization per system per year and solid performance across geographies.General surgery was the strongest in the U.S.; Europe continued to grow and diversify with particular strength in Germany, the U.K. and Ireland, Italy, and Spain. Asia was also very strong. Despite the COVID-related shut-downs in China, procedure growth in the region did slightly better than the global average. Japan and South Korea also grew strongly.Lockheed MartinLockheed Martin’s reported earnings of $6.87 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.1%. Revenue missed by 1.4%.The Aeronautics segment was the biggest driver of profit, along with the Space segment. Management attributed the increase in cash flows to the “timing of production and billing cycles (primarily the F-35 program” ($325 million of sales from the previous quarter was recognized in the last quarter). Demand remains strong but revenue continues to be impacted by supply chain issues.Lockheed returns value to investors through dividends and share repurchases. The quarterly dividend was increased substantially (by $0.20 to $3.00 per share). Including the increase, the dividend yields 2.7%.Management expects 2023 sales to be consistent with 2022 with growth returning in 2024.United AirlinesUnited Airlines’ earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 27.2% on sales that beat by 1.3%.Better still, management said that Q4 revenue grew 13.2% over 2019 levels, total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) grew 25.5% and even costs came in lower than expected. Additionally, holiday demand in the current quarter is expected to exceed 2019 levels as well.General industry commentary was very positive, and similar to Delta, which reported earlier: “air travel is still in the COVID recovery phase, hybrid work gives customers the freedom and flexibility to travel for leisure more often, and external supply challenges will limit industry supply for years to come.” Management believes these trends will offset the effects of economic headwinds.Netflix, Intuitive Surgical and Lockheed Martin carry #3 Zacks Ranks, which translates to a Hold Rating.

""People want to travel and have experiences, and hybrid work environment untethered them from the office and gave them the newfound flexibility to travel far more often than before.""All this comes despite airlines raising ticket prices while only slowly adding flights they had cut during the pandemic. Round-trip airfare had surged 41% as of June 2022 compared to the same time one year ago, according to the most recent data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. In terms of the upcoming holiday season, the appetite for travel is expected to remain strong after two years of pandemic-related softness. For Thanksgiving, the average domestic flight will cost around $350 per ticket, up 43% from 2021 levels, according to Hopper, a travel agency. During Christmas, that fare is likely to be higher than the Thanksgiving average by over $100.United said Tuesday that air travel is still recovering from the pandemic. And it expects sales to increase gradually over time.For one thing, the strong U.S. dollar is prompting more Americans to travel overseas for both business and leisure.""Despite growing concerns about an economic slowdown, the ongoing COVID recovery trends at United continue to prevail and we remain optimistic that we'll continue to deliver strong financial results in the fourth quarter, 2023 and beyond,” Kirby said in a press release. In its third-quarter earnings, United beat Wall Street expectations with revenue of $12.88 billion versus a forecasted $12.72 billion. Its earnings per share was $2.81, versus an average analyst estimate of $2.29.  United’s shares surged 7.1% during early trading on Wednesday before retreating somewhat to close with a 5% gain.Story continuesThis story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: The best high-yield savings accounts of 2022Van life is just ‘glorified homelessness,’ says a 33-year-old woman who tried the nomadic lifestyle and ended up brokeMark Zuckerberg has a $10 billion plan to make it impossible for remote workers to hide from their bossesAmericans carry 4 credit cards on average.

United is seeing strong demand for its Polaris business class seats from leisure travelers, although they don't generally pay as much for the lie-flat seats. United AirlinesDo you remember when the airline industry embraced existential concerns early in the pandemic about a drop-off in business travel, and questioned how leisure travel could possibly fill the gap?During their third quarter earnings call Wednesday, United Airlines officials expressed optimism that business travel would almost certainly pick up in the future from current levels, but touted the “permanent” advantageous changes, including new efficiencies, that current hybrid work environments have created for the airline.“There’s been a permanent structural change in leisure demand because of the flexibility that hybrid work allows,” CEO Scott Kirby said.Chief Commercial Officer Andrew Nocella told analysts that traditional troughs in demand on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, and holiday traffic spread out beyond a weekend or several days would enable United to operate a “less peak schedule,” leading to “really enormous efficiency gains.”“I think [it is] a really interesting opportunity for United as it transitions from a very peaky schedule to something that’s less peaked,” Nocella said.Even “secondary holidays are incredibly strong, not just the primary holidays,” he added.Nocella said “that the marginal cost of an ASM (available seat mile) in February is very different than that in July.”Kirby acknowledged that pessimism is rampant about the global economy, but several factors will help the the airline industry, including United, in “overcoming those macro headwinds.”Kirby cited the “permanent structural changes” that flexible work environments have created.“And regardless of what you think demand for business travel will ultimately return to 100 percent or something less, it almost certainly is going higher from here,” Kirby said.There eventually will be an additional upside because the global airline industry currently is 10-15 percent smaller compared with pre-Covid gross domestic product because of a variety of factors, including pilot shortages, aircraft delivery shortfalls, and airport constraints, Kirby said.Story continuesAn upsurge in leisure travel and airline efficiencies tied to pent-up demand or flexible work arrangements won’t in themselves make United whole, although the airline is witnessing “incredible strength” from flyers booking coach seats, and the Premium Plus cabin, Nocella said.“The more leisure-oriented nature of some of the Polaris [business class] traffic today does fly at a lower yield than has traditionally been in that cabin,” Nocella said. “So as that returns to normal, however fast or slow that occurs, that will continue to provide, I think, more of a tailwind going forward.”United said during the third quarter it beat analysts’ expectation on “operating revenue, unit costs and adjusted operating margin.” The airline’s operating revenue in the third quarter of $12.9 billion was 13.2 percent higher than the comparable period in 2019.United’s notched third quarter net income of $942 million, almost twice that of the same period a year ago, but still well below the more than $1 billion in profits it generated in the third quarter of 2019.United said it expects its operating margin the fourth quarter of 2022 to exceed 2019 marks for the first time.Kirby said he’d wager that many of the analysts or investors listening to the company’s earnings call Wednesday “have taken an extra trip or two this year because you can work remotely for a couple of those days.”Added Kirby: “This is not pent-up demand. It’s the new normal.”Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

Nor was I taken aback by the shiny marble floors or the modern conference rooms equipped with state-of-the-art technology in what is now PNC Plaza in Houston, Texas.My self-doubt came from observing two employees wearing freshly pressed suits who were chatting in the hallway. I assumed they were in the middle of rounding out a major financial decision that could make a huge impact on a small business, corporation, consumer, or community. It was an intimidating sight for a young Latino professional who had never been in that environment before. It also brought up an unexpected question in my mind:Do I really belong here?PNC Unidos Hispanic and Latino Leaders ForumI never felt more out of place. Before the interview's first question, I was already telling myself that I didn't fit in. I'm sure my story isn't the same for all Latinos in the corporate world. However, I can't help but think that most have wrestled with the feeling of belonging at some point in their career.This experience has been running on a constant loop in my head lately, and for good reason.In mid-September, on the cusp of Hispanic Heritage Month, I attended the inaugural PNC Unidos Hispanic and Latino Leaders Forum in Miami, Fla. The two-day conference gathered select Latino and Hispanic leaders from across the bank to discuss leadership, challenges, and career growth, among other topics.I heard a number of relatable stories, especially from the keynote speaker. He spoke about how he immigrated to the U.S. from Spain, his journey towards fitting in and learning a new language, and building credibility in any way he could, including serving as an Army Ranger in Afghanistan before a successful stint in pro football.Story continuesChallenging Limiting BeliefsThat concept of building credibility and fitting in was an underlying theme throughout his speech. His experiences struck a chord with me because I took a similar approach during my first days in the corporate world. I chose to say my last name without a Spanish accent. I was also careful not to reveal too much of my Mexican heritage. I also wanted to present myself a certain way while I built that same credibility our keynote speaker described.My physical appearance became an obsession. My tie had to be impossibly straight. Not one shred of lint, no matter how small, should be on my suit. My anxiety level reached unprecedented heights every morning when I stepped in front of my bathroom mirror.""You don't have to wear a suit every day,"" my supervisor told me one time.""It's ok, I like wearing suits,"" I responded.While I do love a good suit, I insisted on wearing them because I needed to ""fit in."" I needed to dress better than anyone else. In my mind, that's the only way I could be taken seriously as a Latino in Corporate America.One of my favorite parts of the Unidos forum examined this type of behavior during a seminar about challenging ""limiting beliefs"" to be your true self at work. The presenter spoke of authenticity instead of repressing parts of your persona, like choosing not to speak Spanish, saying your name a certain way, or over-modifying your appearance to conform to traditional standards. It sounded all too familiar. I kept thinking back to my first year in the corporate world, and how many limiting beliefs I didn't challenge.The Right (Corporate) CultureIn overcoming that self-imposed obligation to be a certain way, two developments helped me.First: I eventually - and confidently - decided that I did fit in. One of my parents worked in the corporate world at one point. Both eventually became successful small business owners. My upbringing and the example my parents set for me didn't allow me to continue thinking that success was unreachable.Like our keynote speaker said in his speech: ""Defeat is a personal choice.""Secondly, the more I worked at this company, the more I noticed that my employer saw me as a distinct individual, not just an employee ID number or just ""a suit and tie."" They saw me as a person with a certain background, heritage, culture, and more. I could bring my authentic self to work and not repress the parts that make me who I truly am.I learned that they encouraged diversity, equity and inclusion. When PNC acquired that company, I quickly saw that they lived those same values.I see it even more after attending this forum.The entire event was complex, deep, and multidimensional. To me, though, the bottom line to the PNC Unidos Hispanic and Latino Leaders Forum was simply this: I felt heard. We felt heard.There are now more than 6,500 Latino/Hispanic employees working at PNC. The forum's launch speaks volumes about how much the bank is committed to listening to our unique perspectives for continued growth.The day of my interview with what is now PNC seems like a lifetime ago. But I can still remember the uneasy emotions bubbling furiously in the pit of my stomach. I wish I could tell my past self what was to come. That I was about to step into an environment that not only accepts your background but celebrates and promotes it.In that situation, I've learned that you can both fit in and flourish.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from PNC Financial Services Group on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: PNC Financial Services GroupWebsite: https://www.pnc.com/en/personal-banking.htmlEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: PNC Financial Services GroupView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/721049/A-Firsthand-Look-at-PNCs-Inaugural-Unidos-HispanicLatino-Leaders-Forum]"
262,79174160-81dc-3cab-b705-92c33b3262c3,PNC,2022-10-20,Improve Your Retirement Income with These 3 Top-Ranked Dividend Stocks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/improve-retirement-income-3-top-131001619.html,1666185001,STORY,['PNC'],"[Strange but true: seniors fear death less than running out of money in retirement.Also, retirees who have constructed a nest egg have valid justifications to be concerned, since the traditional ways to plan for retirement may mean income can no longer cover expenses. Some retirees are now tapping their principal to make a decent living, pressed for time between decreasing investment balances and longer life expectancies.The tried-and-true retirement investing approach of yesterday doesn't work today.In the past, investors going into retirement could invest in bonds and count on attractive yields to produce steady, reliable income streams to fund a predictable retirement. 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s hovered around 6.50%, whereas the current rate is much lower.While this yield reduction may not seem drastic, it adds up: for a $1 million investment in 10-year Treasuries, the rate drop means a difference in yield of more than $1 million.And lower bond yields aren't the only potential problem seniors are facing. Today's retirees aren't feeling as secure as they once did about Social Security, either. Benefit checks will still be coming for the foreseeable future, but based on current estimates, Social Security funds will run out of money in 2035.Unfortunately, it looks like the two traditional sources of retirement income - bonds and Social Security - may not be able to adequately meet the needs of present and future retirees. But what if there was another option that could provide a steady, reliable source of income in retirement?Invest in Dividend StocksWe feel that these dividend-paying equities - as long as they are from high-quality, low-risk issuers - can give retirement investors a smart option to replace low-yielding Treasury bonds (or other bonds).Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.Story continuesGoing beyond those familiar names, you can find excellent dividend-paying stocks by following a few guidelines. Look for companies that pay a dividend yield of around 3%, with positive annual dividend growth. The growth rate is key to help combat the effects of inflation.Here are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.Cambridge (CATC) is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.64 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.06%. This compares to the Banks - Northeast industry's yield of 2.34% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.77%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 4.92%. Check Cambridge (CATC) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc (PNC) is paying out a dividend of $1.5 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.84% compared to the Banks - Major Regional industry's yield of 3.7% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 20% over the past year. Check The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc (PNC) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $0.31 per share, S&amp;T Bancorp (STBA) has a dividend yield of 3.71%. This is compared to the Banks - Northeast industry's yield of 2.34% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 7.14%. Check S&amp;T Bancorp (STBA) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?Yes, that's true. As a broad category, bonds carry less risk than stocks. However, the stocks we are talking about - dividend -paying stocks from high-quality companies - can generate income over time and also mitigate the overall volatility of your portfolio compared to the stock market as a whole.Combating the impact of inflation is one advantage of owning these dividend-paying stocks. Here's why: many of these stable, high-quality companies increase their dividends over time, which translates to rising dividend income that offsets the effects of inflation.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.You may be thinking, ""I like this dividend strategy, but instead of investing in individual stocks, I'm going to find a dividend-focused mutual fund or ETF."" This approach can make sense, but be aware that some mutual funds and specialized ETFs carry high fees, which may reduce your dividend gains or income, and defeat the goal of this dividend investment approach. If you do wish to invest in a fund, do your research to find the best-quality dividend funds with the lowest fees.Bottom LineWhether you select high-quality, low-fee funds or stocks, seeking the steady income of dividend-paying equities can potentially offer you a path to a better and more stress-free retirement.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.67%. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.33%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.25%.Coming into today, shares of the retailer had lost 1.75% in the past month. In that same time, the Retail-Wholesale sector lost 4.51%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 3.76%.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Target as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be November 16, 2022. On that day, Target is projected to report earnings of $2.15 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 29.04%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $26.31 billion, up 2.58% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $8.11 per share and revenue of $109.76 billion, which would represent changes of -40.19% and +3.55%, respectively, from the prior year.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Target. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.29% higher within the past month. Target currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).In terms of valuation, Target is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 19.39. This represents a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 21.21.Story continuesWe can also see that TGT currently has a PEG ratio of 1.97. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Retail - Discount Stores was holding an average PEG ratio of 2 at yesterday's closing price.The Retail - Discount Stores industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 221, putting it in the bottom 13% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

The demand for faucets, Fortune Brands CEO Nicholas Fink stops by for an in-depth look into the building products maker amid the housing market slowdown. And no recession-- that's the take from Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan in my chat with him just moments ago. We'll have that interview coming up. Brad, over to you.BRAD SMITH: All right, taking a look at the major averages here, as we've struck the top of the 10:00 AM hour, 30 minutes into trade. And I want to give you a three-day look at what's kind of taking place here over the course of this week, even despite today's little blippity blip. We are seeing us hold on to a three-day gain of about 2.8% here for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The NASDAQ composite, you're seeing that hold onto gains of about 3.7% over that three-day period. But here today, right now, down by about 6/10 of a percent 35 minutes into trade.Also, the S&amp;P 500, you're seeing that lower on the day. That's down by about half a percent. We ran through some of the sectors earlier, but I'd love to shift your attention over to retail, as we're keeping an eye on some of those names, especially within that consumer discretionary construct or discussion here, and especially going into a holiday season where we're still going to be looking through Amazon, Walmart, and some of these sales that are set to commence that have already actually kicked off. Walmart actually announcing this morning that they are not going to be open on Thanksgiving. That continues what we had seen over some recent years as well in 2020 and 2021.And so keep a close eye on these retail names. Amazon down by about 1.7%. Walmart down by about 2/10 of a percent. Target also lower on the day by about 6/10 of a percent. So that's a retail roundup, if you will, for right now at the top of the 10:00 AM hour. Julie, over onto you. Actually, no, we've got a guest that's coming in. Although it may feel like we're already in one, many economists still don't think the US meets the formal definition of a recession, based on broader measures such as income spending and job growth.]"

(NASDAQ:ISRG) may be sending very bearish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios under 14x and even P/E's lower than 8x are not unusual. Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.Intuitive Surgical could be doing better as its earnings have been going backwards lately while most other companies have been seeing positive earnings growth. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this poor earnings performance will turn the corner. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. See our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Intuitive Surgical will help you uncover what's on the horizon.Does Growth Match The High P/E?Intuitive Surgical's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market.Retrospectively, the last year delivered a frustrating 19% decrease to the company's bottom line. This has erased any of its gains during the last three years, with practically no change in EPS being achieved in total. Therefore, it's fair to say that earnings growth has been inconsistent recently for the company.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 21% per annum during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. With the market only predicted to deliver 9.5% per annum, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.In light of this, it's understandable that Intuitive Surgical's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.The Key TakeawayWhile the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.Story continuesWe've established that Intuitive Surgical maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.A lot of potential risks can sit within a company's balance sheet.

271,00431984-50f2-3af1-884c-2bba5e914777,ISRG,2022-10-20,These Stocks Have Popped: Here's Why,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stocks-popped-heres-why-193707219.html,1666208227.0,STORY,"['LMT', 'NFLX', 'ISRG']","[As the Q3 earnings season gathers momentum, investors appear to be handsomely rewarding the companies that improve their revenue and earnings, provided there are also signs of improved visibility.Here is a group of companies that were rewarded yesterday: Netflix NFLX shares jumped 13.8%, Intuitive Surgical ISRG 12.1%, Lockheed Martin LMT 8.7%, and United Airlines UAL 7.0%. Let’s see why-NetflixNetflix reported earnings of $3.10 per share that came in higher than the $2.11 estimated. Revenue came in about 1% higher than estimated.The results may have been much better if it wasn’t for the strong dollar, which significantly impacted inflows from its international business. Investors cheered the fact that memberships continued to grow even if it was mainly driven by Asia, signaling that the pandemic-related disruption was probably over.In the earnings release, management highlighted how Amazon and Disney lagged Netflix in engagement, both in the UK and the U.S. But competition is clearly heating up across geographies. Some on the street are saying that the lower-priced ad-supported plan is designed to target an increasingly competitive market. Others have argued the lack of sense in paying for a plan that comes with ads. But management remains optimistic about the launch next month. We’ll have to see how it goes.Netflix is clearly better positioned than its peers today because they are in the initial investment phase and management is probably right in guessing that they’re making huge losses.Intuitive SurgicalIntuitive Surgical’s earnings missed estimates by 1.1% but its sales beat by 2.2%.Investors piled into the shares after management stated that the company’s business fundamentals strengthened in the third quarter, as reflected by the growth in its installed base, increases in utilization per system per year and solid performance across geographies.General surgery was the strongest in the U.S.; Europe continued to grow and diversify with particular strength in Germany, the U.K. and Ireland, Italy, and Spain. Asia was also very strong. Despite the COVID-related shut-downs in China, procedure growth in the region did slightly better than the global average. Japan and South Korea also grew strongly.Story continuesLockheed MartinLockheed Martin’s reported earnings of $6.87 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.1%. Revenue missed by 1.4%.The Aeronautics segment was the biggest driver of profit, along with the Space segment. Management attributed the increase in cash flows to the “timing of production and billing cycles (primarily the F-35 program” ($325 million of sales from the previous quarter was recognized in the last quarter). Demand remains strong but revenue continues to be impacted by supply chain issues.Lockheed returns value to investors through dividends and share repurchases. The quarterly dividend was increased substantially (by $0.20 to $3.00 per share). Including the increase, the dividend yields 2.7%.Management expects 2023 sales to be consistent with 2022 with growth returning in 2024.United AirlinesUnited Airlines’ earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 27.2% on sales that beat by 1.3%.Better still, management said that Q4 revenue grew 13.2% over 2019 levels, total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) grew 25.5% and even costs came in lower than expected. Additionally, holiday demand in the current quarter is expected to exceed 2019 levels as well.General industry commentary was very positive, and similar to Delta, which reported earlier: “air travel is still in the COVID recovery phase, hybrid work gives customers the freedom and flexibility to travel for leisure more often, and external supply challenges will limit industry supply for years to come.” Management believes these trends will offset the effects of economic headwinds.Netflix, Intuitive Surgical and Lockheed Martin carry #3 Zacks Ranks, which translates to a Hold Rating. United Airlines is ranked #2 (Buy).One-Month Price MovementZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

276,91951204-0a47-3a64-a43d-9daf31609e99,NAVI,2022-10-20,Analysts Estimate Mr Cooper (COOP) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-mr-cooper-coop-140102780.html,1666188062,STORY,"['NAVI', 'COOP']","[The market expects Mr Cooper (COOP) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 26. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis reinsurance company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.50 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -79.3%.Revenues are expected to be $431.6 million, down 49.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.32% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Mr Cooper?For Mr Cooper, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +5.30%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Mr Cooper will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Mr Cooper would post earnings of $0.02 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.17, delivering a surprise of +750%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Mr Cooper doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsNavient (NAVI), another stock in the Zacks Financial - Consumer Loans industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.78 for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -12.4%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $291.89 million, down 2.4% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Navient has been revised 1.9% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 2.56%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Navient will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of Third Point's strategy and Daniel Loeb's background and go directly to the 5 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Dan Loeb.Daniel Loeb is the founder and CEO of Third Point. He graduated from the University of Columbia with a degree in economics in 1983. Soon after his graduation, he started his career in the investment sector by working at Warburg Pincus, a private equity firm. Over the course of his successful career, Daniel served on boards of several publicly traded companies, including Massey Energy, Ligand Pharmaceuticals, and Sotheby's. On October 2020, he was awarded the Alexander Hamilton Award for his philanthropic service by the Manhattan Institute.Third Point is a hedge fund based out of New York, which was launched in 1995 by Daniel Loeb. The fund invests in equity as well as fixed-income markets and invests in value stocks with a long-term view to generate outsized returns for its investors. At the end of Q2 2022, Third Point's investment in the equity market amounted to over $4.2 billion. The firm holds a concentrated portfolio with PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) as its biggest holding.Our MethodologyWe picked the top 10 stocks from Third Point's portfolio as of Q2 2022.10. Cenovus Energy Inc. (NYSE:CV­E)Third Point Stake: $138,298,000 Percentage of Third Point's Portfolio: 3.27%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42Cenovus Energy Inc. (NYSE:CVE) is an oil company engaging in the development of its oil assets. Moreover, the firm produces conventional crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas. Third Point continued to add onto its investment in Cenovus Energy Inc. (NYSE:CVE), as it increased its stake in the company by 264% during the second quarter. The total investment value of the fund in Cenovus Energy Inc. (NYSE:CVE) amounted to approximately $138 million at the end of Q2 2022.Story continuesOn October 14, 2022, Jason Bouvier, an analyst at Scotiabank, trimmed his price target to C$33 while maintaining an Outperform rating on the company's shares. Cenovus Energy Inc. (NYSE:CVE) has outperformed the market in 2022 and is up 48.7% YTD.L1 Capital mentioned the firm in its Q2 2022 investor letter, outlining that:MEG Energy and Cenovus Energy Inc. (NYSE:CVE): We continue to remain positive on the outlook for Energy. While a potential U.S. recession would result in softer oil demand, we believe this would be more than outweighed by China re-opening over the coming year (which would see a major lift in car and air traffic). Oil supply continues to remain constrained with sustained declines in global inventories and OPEC+ remains unable to grow production significantly. With the sell-off in energy stocks, MEG and Cenovus are currently generating more than 20% of their market cap in cash flow with large dividends and share buybacks to come.Cenovus Energy (Long +14%) shares rallied driven by continued strong free cash flow generation, as well as being positioned to benefit from strong refining margins and downstream operations. The company recently announced a significant increase in dividends, which gives us greater confidence on the potential for a 100% return of free cash flow generation via dividends and buybacks from early CY23. Given the long-life nature of its oil sand assets and its low cost of production, we estimate the company is free cash flow break-even at an oil price of ~US$40/bbl. At present, oil prices are more than double this break-even point, implying considerable upside to consensus cash flow estimates (if prices remain near current levels). There are also additional value realisation catalysts with the company continuing to progress the de-gearing of its balance sheet via organic cash generation and asset sales.At the end of Q2 2022, Soroban Capital Partners remained the leading stakeholder of the company, with a holding of 50,338,822. As per Insider's Monkey database, 42 hedge funds owned stakes in Cenovus Energy Inc. (NYSE:CVE) at the end of the second quarter.In addition to Cenovus Energy Inc. (NYSE:CVE), Third Point had investments in UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR), and PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG).9.

The fund's investment in CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) at the end of the Q2 2022 amounted to approximately $144 million.On September 30, 2022, Brandon Oglenski, an analyst at Barclays, reduced his price target on CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) to $35. Although the analyst has an Overweight rating on the shares, he believes that margins in the railroad sector will continue to face pressure in the short term due to volume decline and labor issues.Clearbridge Investments mentioned CSX Corporation (NYSE:CSX) in their Q4 2021 investor letter. This is what they had to say:On a regional basis, the U.S. and Canada was the top contributor to quarterly performance, of which U.S. rail operators CSX (NYSE:CSX) was among the lead performers. CSX (NYSE:CSX) is one of five leading North American rail companies, with over 21,000 miles of rail, covering 23 states and 40+ ports. CSX (NYSE:CSX) is engaged in the transportation of rail freight in the Southeast, East, and Midwest via interchange with other rail carriers, to and from the rest of the U.S. and Canada. CSX (NYSE:CSX) performed well during the quarter after the company beats market expectations on its third-quarter results. The beats were largely driven by strong pricing, which could be hitting record highs, and healthy commodity/coal volume driven by the current energy crisis.As per Insider's Monkey database, 63 hedge funds owned stakes in Cheniere Energy, Inc. (NYSE:LNG) at the end of the June quarter.  Soroban Capital Partners was the most bullish fund on the company's stock, with a total holding of 52,600,295.8.

The analyst believes that Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) has a strong history of surviving in all business cycles and will continue to do well, but the foreign exchange impact due to the appreciation of the US dollar will have an adverse impact on the company.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, First Eagle Investments Global Fund mentioned Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) and explained its insights for the company. Here is what the fund said:Shares of consumer staples giant Colgate-Palmolive have performed well as investors rotated into more recessionary-resilient defensive stocks amid the broader selloff during the second quarter. The company raised revenue guidance for 2022 but lowered its margin outlook because of higher costs for raw materials, packaging and logistics; we believe that the company's size and market share provide it with options to mitigate the inflation challenges it faces. We continue to like Colgate- Palmolive's dividend and previously announced $5 billion stock buyback program.7. DuPont de Nemours, Inc. (NYSE:DD)Third Point Stake: $171,186,000 Percentage of Third Point's Portfolio: 4.05%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44DuPont de Nemours, Inc.

Juvekar, an analyst at Citi, made a downward revision to his price target on DuPont de Nemours, Inc. (NYSE:DD). The analyst now has a price target of $67 on the company's shares. He believes that chemical companies will not thrive at least till spring next year as global economies face a recession and the spending in the housing and construction sector slows down.Here is what Rhizome Partners has to say about DuPont de Nemours, Inc. (NYSE:DD) in its Q1 2021 investor letter:We have written extensively about the anticipated DuPont's Reverse Morris Trust merger with International Flavors and Fragrances (IFF) in January of 2021. During the quarter, DuPont shares traded up significantly in anticipation of the deal. We tendered about 40% of our DuPont shares for IFF and received about half of the allocation due to pro-ration. Investors are finally starting to appreciate DuPont's effort to cut costs, streamline operations, and spin off companies into pure-play companies that trade at higher multiples. We are still getting used to the higher multiples that investors will pay for larger market cap and pure play companies such as DuPont.6. EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT)Third Point Stake: $258,860,000 Percentage of Third Point's Portfolio: 6.12%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) is a producer of natural operating in the United States.

Here is what the fund said:We initiated a position in EQT (NYSE:EQT), the largest natural gas producer in the U.S., which possesses high-quality acreage within the Marcellus Shale basin. EQT has benefited from tight supply and demand dynamics as cleaner-burning natural gas takes global share from coal and exports to Europe and Asia provide an avenue of demand growth. Longer-term contracts enhance EQT's earnings visibility as Europe eliminates its dependence on Russian gas. Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Dan Loeb.Suggested articles:10 Best International Stocks To Buy Today10 Best Hurricane Stocks To Invest InBest Golf Stocks To Buy Now Disclosure: None. 10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Dan Loeb is originally published on Insider Monkey. ]"

Each one is a destination in and of itself filled with an array of experiences, live entertainment and ways to grab a bite and a drink, so that everyone can make memories their way every day.Ways to Play Across Five New NeighborhoodsThrill Island – Vacationers can test their limits, scale new heights and reach top speeds at the center of thrill. This lost island adventure is home to highlights like Category 6, the largest waterpark at sea, with six record-breaking slides: Pressure Drop and its 66-degree incline make it the industry's first open free-fall slide; the 46-foot-tall Frightening Bolt, the tallest drop slide at sea; Storm Surge and Hurricane Hunter, the first family raft slides at sea with four riders per raft; and Storm Chasers, cruising's first mat-racing duo. Living on the edge takes new meaning with Crown's Edge. Part skywalk, part ropes course and part thrill ride, it culminates in a surprising, shocking moment that will see travelers swing 154 feet above the ocean.Chill Island – Among the seven pools on board, four are in this three-deck slice of paradise. There's a pool for every mood, each with prime ocean views: the vibrant Swim &amp; Tonic, the line's first swim-up bar at sea; Royal Bay Pool, the largest pool at sea; Cloud 17, an adults-only retreat; and the serene, infinity-edge Cove Pool. Plus, The Lime &amp; Coconut returns with four locations, including Royal Caribbean's first frozen cocktail bar.Surfside – Introducing a neighborhood made for young families from end to end, where adults and kids ages six and under will want to stay and play all day. Grownups can soak up the endless views at Water's Edge pool, as they keep an eye on the kids at Splashaway Bay and Baby Bay. Only steps away are dining options, places to lounge, a bar, the signature carousel, an arcade, Adventure Ocean, and Social020 for teens. The Hideaway – Tucked away, this neighborhood 135 feet above the ocean combines the good vibes of beach club scenes around the world and the uninterrupted ocean views only a cruise can offer. The first suspended infinity pool at sea is at the center of it all, and it's surrounded by a multilevel sun terrace with whirlpools, a variety of seating and a dedicated bar.AquaDome – Perched at the top of Icon, what's in store is a transformational place unlike any other. In a tranquil oasis by day, guests can take in wraparound ocean views and an awe-inspiring waterfall as they enjoy a bite or drink. By night, it becomes a vibrant place great for a night out, complete with restaurants, bars and the cruise line's marquee aqua shows at the next-level AquaTheater. The signature entertainment venue takes artistry and cutting-edge technology to new heights, with a transforming pool, four robotic arms, state-of-the-art projection and more.Ways to Play Across Three Familiar Neighborhoods and FavoritesThe cruise line has raised the bar even further with each of its signature neighborhoods: A grander Royal Promenade features its first floor-to-ceiling ocean views, plus more than 15 restaurants, cafes, bars and lounges; a more lush and livelier Central Park has more ways to dine and be entertained; and the largest Suite Neighborhood is three decks of luxury, offering a multilevel suite sun deck – The Grove – that has a private pool, whirlpool and dining, and a two-story Coastal Kitchen. More returning favorites include experiences like new takes on mini golf at Lost Dunes, rock climbing at Adrenaline Peak, and Absolute Zero, Royal Caribbean's largest ice arena, and dining venues such as Giovanni's Italian Kitchen &amp; Wine Bar on the Royal Promenade and the Asian-inspired Izumi in Central Park.With 28 ways to stay, even the rooms are thoughtfully designed for every type of vacationer. It's come one, come all with more choices, ocean views and room. There are new layouts made for families of three, four, five and more, like the Family Infinite Balcony and Surfside Family Suite – with kids alcoves tucked away from the adults – and the three-story Ultimate Family Townhouse, complete with its own white picket fence and mailbox. When it comes to views, among the best are from the brand's first Sunset Corner Suites and Panoramic Ocean Views in AquaDome.The debut of Icon Class will also mark firsts and the next step in Royal Caribbean's journey toward a clean-energy future. Icon will be the cruise line's first ship with fuel cell technology and powered by liquefied natural gas (LNG), the cleanest-burning marine fuel. Along with other proven applications, such as shore power connection and waste heat recovery systems, the new ship will be the cruise line's most sustainable to date.The bold, new standard of vacations also extends to the home away from home for those at the heart of Icon – the crew. Where they live and work has been reimagined with more intuitive design, amenities, room and activities, including a new, patented stateroom created by crew for crew.Icon will sail year-round, 7-night Eastern and Western Caribbean vacations from Miami. Every cruise will visit Royal Caribbean's top-rated private island destination, Perfect Day at CocoCay, The Bahamas, where adventurers can create their ideal vacation day. In store is everything thrill and chill, from Thrill Waterpark's 13 waterslides, including the tallest in North America; to Coco Beach Club, featuring the first overwater cabanas in The Bahamas; and Up, Up &amp; Away, a helium balloon adventure. When Icon arrives, the cruise line will debut the island's adults-only oasis, Hideaway Beach, with an expansive pool, private cabanas with pools, and unmatched views of the ocean hues. Vacationers will also visit Caribbean gems like Cozumel, Mexico; Philipsburg, St. Maarten; and Roatan, Honduras.More details about Icon will be revealed in the coming months.

October is National Disability Employment Awareness Month, an observance held to recognize the contributions of America's workers with disabilities and promote supportive and inclusive employment policies and practices. Below, we highlight a nonprofit empowering youth who are blind or visually impaired. Learn how Regions Bank team members are providing their support.Regions Bank, Wednesday, October 19, 2022, Press release pictureBy Kim Borges""He's never going to ride a bike.""They would have been soul-crushing words for many parents to hear. But not Alan Chase's.""My parents had to be my advocates,"" said Chase, reflecting on his youngest days in rural Eastern North Carolina. ""For me as a child, the expectations were low. The teachers really didn't know how to deal with me. I think they were mostly worried about me getting hurt and wanted to put me in bubble wrap.""But Chase and his parents knew he was capable of achieving anything he desired despite a visual impairment. Today, Dr. Chase - he earned a doctoral degree in Education - is instilling that same message in middle and high school youth who are blind or visually impaired. He's doing so through his Envisioning Youth Empowerment (EYE) Retreat.""We needed an avenue to bring people together to see how we could increase employability and opportunities for education,"" Chase said of the nonprofit he established in 2009.Each summer, 40 teens from across the country head to the Governor Morehead School in Raleigh for the EYE Retreat camp covering topics like adapting to college life, daily living skills, assistive technology resources, self-advocacy strategies and more.""What I tell parents is that we try to squeeze about five years of life into five days,"" said Chase. ""We ask questions like, ‘What should you be thinking about as you're preparing to graduate from high school? How do you access services on a college campus?' We also emphasize that college isn't just about taking classes; there are social and independence aspects as well.""Story continuesRegions Bank associates recently delivered financial education for EYE Retreat campers discussing that independence aspect. The connection occurred thanks to Juan Pablo Ceballos Garcia, manager of Regions' Northpark branch in Raleigh, where Chase is a customer.""I think the bank's involvement with projects like the EYE Retreat shows our customers and the community that we not only talk the talk when it comes to being inclusive, we live by it in making accessible products available.""LaShon Fletcher, supervisor of Regions' Deposit and Document Operations group""When Alan expressed interest in teaching the campers about financial literacy and how to apply to college, I was excited to find out how we could help make the seminar possible,"" said Garcia. ""Our teammates did a phenomenal job following up to make this event a reality.""Leading that team? Kathy Lovell and Keren Treme from Regions' Community Affairs group, who taught the Money Basics for Life workshop. The course is designed for people with disabilities and is part of Regions' Next Step curriculum.""We are passionate about empowering people through financial wellness, so we were very eager to work with Alan,"" said Lovell, disability services and outreach manager for Regions. ""Our Money Basics for Life workshops are highly interactive sessions discussing ways to bank independently, and that was certainly the case with the EYE Retreat campers who asked incredibly thoughtful questions.""Lovell enlisted additional support from the Deposit and Document Operations team to secure Braille materials for the session. But the group did more than just obtain the handouts from a Braille provider.""We covered the cost of the materials as a way of supporting our Disability Services team while also promoting financial education,"" said LaShon Fletcher, supervisor of Regions' Deposit and Document Operations group. ""I think the bank's involvement with projects like the EYE Retreat shows our customers and the community that we not only talk the talk when it comes to being inclusive, we live by it in making accessible products available.""That welcoming approach was noticed by campers Anagha Puranik and Terrell Covington.""I loved the Regions Bank presentation and their work being so inclusive,"" said Puranik. ""The main takeaway I had was how anything is possible if you put your mind to it and how hard work always pays off. I gained a whole new perspective and learned lifelong lessons that will improve my future.""""This session encouraged me to be creative with managing and saving my own money,"" Covington added. ""I am more independent when coming to the EYE Retreat. I'm extremely happy to be in this positive and safe environment every summer around peers who are like me.""Campers are also partnered with adult mentors who are visually impaired. It's all part of Chase's purpose to create that safe, positive space while encouraging campers to push beyond their comfort zones.""At the end of the week, which is my favorite time, we go off campus, taking the campers to a local university and businesses,"" said Chase. ""They also navigate public transportation. It offers students a chance to consider, ‘How do I advocate for myself?' and ‘How do I ask for assistance?'""Chase and team also encourage campers to think about what their long-term employment resembles.""‘What career am I going to pursue?' and ‘What accommodations do I need in the workplace?' are additional questions we explore,"" said Chase.The week is filled with questions; but it's also filled with fellowship and self-discovery.""For many students, they might be the only visually impaired student in their whole county,"" said Chase. ""Because of that, the opportunity for social interaction and networking is limited. We have students come to the EYE Retreat from Ohio, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and Florida. That tells me what we're doing is unique.""And fun. Many campers are repeat participants.""Fourteen years ago, we had no idea if this was going to be successful, effective and popular,"" said Chase. ""I'm now asked every year when camp is going to be two weeks long.""Alan Chase's life is far bigger than others may have imagined it would be. But not to him - or his parents.""I had to find my own voice,"" Chase recalled, thinking of how his parents gave him faithful support; the rest was based on his own determination.It's a model for others to follow - and one that more advocates and businesses are proud to support.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Regions Bank on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Regions BankWebsite: profiles/regions-bankEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Regions BankView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/721153/With-Tools-and-Training-From-Regions-North-Carolina-Teens-Retreat-From-No-Challenge]"

285,96a834a2-33d5-39ef-b60e-a5046d2a5f7a,APH,2022-10-20,Amphenol (APH) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amphenol-aph-earnings-expected-grow-140102832.html,1666188062,STORY,['APH'],"[Amphenol (APH) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 26. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis maker of fiber-optic products is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.75 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +15.4%.Revenues are expected to be $3.08 billion, up 9.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.98% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Amphenol?For Amphenol, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.48%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Amphenol will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Amphenol would post earnings of $0.67 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.75, delivering a surprise of +11.94%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Amphenol doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Netflix NFLX, Intuitive Surgical ISRG, Lockheed Martin LMT and United Airlines UAL.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:These Stocks Have Popped: Here's WhyAs the Q3 earnings season gathers momentum, investors appear to be handsomely rewarding the companies that improve their revenue and earnings, provided there are also signs of improved visibility.Here is a group of companies that were rewarded this week: Netflix shares jumped 13.8%, Intuitive Surgical 12.1%, Lockheed Martin 8.7%, and United Airlines 7.0%. Let’s see why-NetflixNetflix reported earnings of $3.10 per share that came in higher than the $2.11 estimated. Revenue came in about 1% higher than estimated.The results may have been much better if it wasn’t for the strong dollar, which significantly impacted inflows from its international business. Investors cheered the fact that memberships continued to grow even if it was mainly driven by Asia, signaling that the pandemic-related disruption was probably over.In the earnings release, management highlighted how Amazon and Disney lagged Netflix in engagement, both in the UK and the U.S. But competition is clearly heating up across geographies. Some on the street are saying that the lower-priced ad-supported plan is designed to target an increasingly competitive market. Others have argued the lack of sense in paying for a plan that comes with ads. But management remains optimistic about the launch next month. We’ll have to see how it goes.Netflix is clearly better positioned than its peers today because they are in the initial investment phase and management is probably right in guessing that they’re making huge losses.Story continuesIntuitive SurgicalIntuitive Surgical’s earnings missed estimates by 1.1% but its sales beat by 2.2%.Investors piled into the shares after management stated that the company’s business fundamentals strengthened in the third quarter, as reflected by the growth in its installed base, increases in utilization per system per year and solid performance across geographies.General surgery was the strongest in the U.S.; Europe continued to grow and diversify with particular strength in Germany, the U.K. and Ireland, Italy, and Spain. Asia was also very strong. Despite the COVID-related shut-downs in China, procedure growth in the region did slightly better than the global average. Japan and South Korea also grew strongly.Lockheed MartinLockheed Martin’s reported earnings of $6.87 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.1%. Revenue missed by 1.4%.The Aeronautics segment was the biggest driver of profit, along with the Space segment. Management attributed the increase in cash flows to the “timing of production and billing cycles (primarily the F-35 program” ($325 million of sales from the previous quarter was recognized in the last quarter). Demand remains strong but revenue continues to be impacted by supply chain issues.Lockheed returns value to investors through dividends and share repurchases. The quarterly dividend was increased substantially (by $0.20 to $3.00 per share). Including the increase, the dividend yields 2.7%.Management expects 2023 sales to be consistent with 2022 with growth returning in 2024.United AirlinesUnited Airlines’ earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 27.2% on sales that beat by 1.3%.Better still, management said that Q4 revenue grew 13.2% over 2019 levels, total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) grew 25.5% and even costs came in lower than expected. Additionally, holiday demand in the current quarter is expected to exceed 2019 levels as well.General industry commentary was very positive, and similar to Delta, which reported earlier: “air travel is still in the COVID recovery phase, hybrid work gives customers the freedom and flexibility to travel for leisure more often, and external supply challenges will limit industry supply for years to come.” Management believes these trends will offset the effects of economic headwinds.Netflix, Intuitive Surgical and Lockheed Martin carry #3 Zacks Ranks, which translates to a Hold Rating.

The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Snap-on What's The Estimated Valuation?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$969.1mUS$900.0mUS$928.0mUS$944.0mUS$946.3mUS$953.5mUS$964.2mUS$977.5mUS$992.8mUS$1.01bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 0.24%Est @ 0.76%Est @ 1.13%Est @ 1.38%Est @ 1.56%Est @ 1.69% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.7% US$908US$790US$763US$727US$683US$645US$611US$580US$552US$526(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$6.8bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.0b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.7%– 2.0%) = US$22bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$22b÷ ( 1 + 6.7%)10= US$11bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$18b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$214, the company appears quite undervalued at a 37% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Snap-on as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.018. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

Management evaluates the company’s sales performance based on organic sales growth, which primarily reflects growth from the company’s existing businesses as a result of increased output, expanded customer base, geographic expansion, new product development and pricing changes, and excludes sales contributions from acquired operations the company did not own as of the comparable prior-year reporting period. Organic sales also exclude the effects of foreign currency translation as foreign currency translation is subject to volatility that can obscure underlying business trends. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure of organic sales is meaningful to investors as it provides them with useful information to aid in identifying underlying growth trends in the company’s businesses and facilitates comparisons of its sales performance with prior periods.About Snap-onSnap-on Incorporated is a leading global innovator, manufacturer, and marketer of tools, equipment, diagnostics, repair information and systems solutions for professional users performing critical tasks including those working in vehicle repair, aerospace, the military, natural resources, and manufacturing.

299,25668c66-812c-3bf5-a483-662b09203c30,VZ,2022-10-20,Telecom Earnings Preview: Can AT&T and Verizon Stocks Rebound?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/telecom-earnings-preview-t-verizon-205608610.html,1666212968,STORY,"['VZ', 'T', 'T-PA', 'T-PC']","[Consumer demand for mobile devices and wireless services will always be relatively strong. But the increasing competition among telecommunication providers has been more apparent than ever in the past few years.That being said, the Wireless National Industry is currently in the top 36% out of 251 Zacks Industries and a long-term expansion and pivotal role wireless communication plays should leave room for multiple players.Let’s take a look at the two largest wireless service providers going into their third quarter earnings.AT&amp;T T Trading 27% from its highs, investors will be watching AT&amp;T (T) when it reports Q3 earnings on October 28. AT&amp;T is the second largest wireless service provider in North America offering a wide range of communication and business solutions that include wireless, local exchange, long distance, data/broadband and internet video managed networking, wholesale and cloud-based services.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AT&amp;T Q3 earnings is $0.61 a share, which would represent a -30% decline from Q3 2021. Sales are also expected to be down -25% at $29.82 billion. Estimates for the period have gone down from $0.64 at the beginning of the quarter. Year over year, AT&amp;T earnings are expected to decline -25% in 2022. Fiscal year 2023 earnings are expected to stabilize but still be down -1% at $2.49 a share. Sales are also expected to decline -25% in FY22 and drop another -3% in FY23 at $122.38 billion. Operating costs for expanding its 5G infrastructure are currently weighing on the company’s earnings and late phone payments have affected AT&amp;T’s free cash flow and sales.AT&amp;T stock has fallen -37% year to date to underperform the S&amp;P 500’s -22% and its peer group’s -9%. AT&amp;T’s poor performance started before the current market conditions. AT&amp;T is down -59% over the last three years to underperform the benchmark’s +25% and its peer group’s -31% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesInvestors will hope that AT&amp;T can get back to its past performance. AT&amp;T’s 20-year total return performance which includes its favorable dividend is +134%. While this still underperformed the benchmark, it crushed its peer group’s +27%.The company’s attempt to enter the Cable and Television industry by acquiring DirectTV had an ill effect on the stock. Higher operating costs to expand into the industry on top of the $49 billion acquisition price weighed down AT&amp;T’s earnings. Things could start to turn around for AT&amp;T now that it has spun off DirectTV and is back to its bread in butter as a wireless service provider.Trading around $15 a share, AT&amp;T trades at a 6.1X forward earnings multiple, well below the industry average of 23.4X. This is also well below its decade-high of 15.3X and the median of 12.1X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAT&amp;T currently holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and is starting to offer longer-term investors value at current levels. Investors will want to see if the company can post a Q3 earnings beat and possibly raise its guidance going into Q4 and FY23.This will certainly get more investors interested in the stock again and bode well with its higher than average 7.12% annual dividend yield at $1.11 a share. The average Zacks Price Target of $23.14 also suggests 48% upside from current levels.Verizon VZ Trading 33% from its highs, Verizon (VZ) reports third quarter earnings on October 21. Verizon has passed AT&amp;T as the largest wireless service provider in North America. Verizon services millions of customers nationwide through local phone service, long distance, wireless and data services.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Verizon’s Q3 earnings is $1.28 per share, which would represent a -9% decrease from Q3 2021. Sales for Q3 are expected to be up 2% at $33.78 billion which suggests operating costs may be wearing on the company’s bottom line.Year over year, VZ earnings are expected to decline -4% in 2022. However, FY23 earnings are set to rise by 2% at $5.28 per share. Top line growth is expected, with FY22 sales projected to be up 2% and rise another 1% in FY23 to $138.45 billion.It will be important to see if Verizon still has more growth ahead of it given the tougher operating environment along with the fact that it’s already the largest wireless service provider in the nation. VZ is down -29% YTD, near the S&amp;P 500’s decline and below its peer group’s -9%. VZ is also down -40% over the last three years to underperform the benchmark’s +25% and its peer group’s -31%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Investors are hoping that Verizon can also get back to its strong past performance. Over the last 20 years, VZ’s total return performance including dividends is a solid +173%. While this is below the benchmark, it crushed its peer group’s +27%.Currently trading around $37 a share, VZ has a P/E of 7.1X. This is much lower than the industry average of 23.4X. Even better, VZ trades at a discount to its decade-long highs of 19.2X and the median of 12.3X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVerizon currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Management’s ability to show the company can be profitable amid rising inflation will be key to the stock rebounding. For now, patient investors are rewarded with Verizon’s stellar 7.04% dividend yield at $2.61 per share. The average Zacks Price Target also offers 46% upside from current levels.Bottom LinePositive third quarter earnings reports and strong guidance could give a much needed boost to the nation’s two largest wireless service providers. Both AT&amp;T and Verizon trade at a discount relative to their past and offer high dividend yields to reward patient investors. In addition to income in the portfolio, holding their stocks could further payoff as their low valuations also make them look poised to rebound.  Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with both ""A"" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.One company value investors might notice is MINISO Group Holding Limited (MNSO). MNSO is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 8.42 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 10.26. Over the past 52 weeks, MNSO's Forward P/E has been as high as 29.32 and as low as 8, with a median of 16.32.Another valuation metric that we should highlight is MNSO's P/B ratio of 1.46. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks solid versus its industry's average P/B of 2.48. Over the past 12 months, MNSO's P/B has been as high as 5.07 and as low as 1.30, with a median of 2.27.Investors could also keep in mind Tapestry (TPR), an Retail - Apparel and Shoes stock with a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and Value grade of A.Shares of Tapestry are currently trading at a forward earnings multiple of 7.86 and a PEG ratio of 0.63 compared to its industry's P/E and PEG ratios of 10.26 and 0.67, respectively.Story continuesOver the past year, TPR's P/E has been as high as 13.39, as low as 6.70, with a median of 8.97; its PEG ratio has been as high as 1.09, as low as 0.57, with a median of 0.23 during the same time period.Additionally, Tapestry has a P/B ratio of 3.31 while its industry's price-to-book ratio sits at 2.48. For TPR, this valuation metric has been as high as 4.14, as low as 2.63, with a median of 3.46 over the past year.These are just a handful of the figures considered in MINISO Group Holding Limited and Tapestry's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment. Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook, and we can clearly see that MNSO and TPR is an impressive value stock right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Get it sent directly to your inbox every Wednesday by 4 p.m. ET. SubscribeWednesday, Oct. 19, 2022The pandemic rubber band is hitting the tech industry.Microsoft (MSFT) made headlines this week when reports emerged that it slashed nearly 1,000 jobs, making it the latest tech giant to respond to economic turmoil.The company characterized its layoffs as “structural adjustments,” stressing that it would keep hiring in “key growth areas.” The cuts still might have surprised some observers. While Microsoft's stock is down 22% over the past 12 months, some competitors have fared worse. Amazon is down nearly 32%. Salesforce plummeted 47%, and Google is down 28%.The recent bad news in the tech industry could be a delayed blow from the pandemic. Interest rate hikes, inflation hovering at 40-year highs and sinking demand are hitting tech companies that have benefited from two years of pandemic-driven growth that saw valuations for some companies eclipse the $2 trillion mark.“As we entered the pandemic, everybody was afraid that there were going to be these disastrous layoffs and it was going to be horrible. And there were, very briefly, in a few places…but that immediately turned around,” TECHnalysis president and chief analyst Bob O’Donnell told Yahoo Finance.“In a weird way, it almost feels like now we're getting some of the impact of the pandemic after the fact,” he added. “I think people are recognizing they maybe over extended their hiring when they expected some of the growth that happened during the pandemic to continue in the tech industry.”Slowing sales, falling stock prices, and layoffsWhile Microsoft is easily the largest tech company to lay off employees, it’s far from the only one. Netflix (NFLX) cut off hundreds of employees as subscriber numbers faltered following the pandemic, and Snap eliminated 20% of its employees.Story continuesMicrosoft is laying off workers as it deals with falling PC sales. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson, File)Meta, meanwhile, is slowly pushing workers out the door via department reorganizations. Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), for its part, shuttered projects at its Area 120 division and asked employees to reapply for jobs elsewhere.Microsoft’s downsizing efforts come as the PC market is experiencing its worst contraction in years. According to Gartner, PC shipments slipped 19.5% in Q3 2022. The reason for the decline? During the pandemic, consumers ran out to stores in search of PCs for everything from work to entertainment. As a result, shipments jumped 32% in Q1 2021 to 69.9 million units. Now that pandemic-powered expansion is rubberbanding back.The drop in PC sales is hitting chip makers, too. Intel (INTC) is expected to lay off thousands of workers, with an announcement likely to take place sometime around its Oct. 27 earnings report. AMD (AMD), Nvidia (NVDA), and Micron (MU) have all been slammed by a decline in PC sales, too. Nvidia already froze hiring for the rest of its fiscal 2023.But Microsoft doesn’t just rely on PC sales. The company’s cloud business has been a growth juggernaut for years. So why the layoffs? Falling share prices could be one reason.“I think there's a sense of internal pressure to deliver better results for shareholders,” O’Donnell said. “And that means increasing the profitability, even though they're already making a lot of money. And I think that's what part of the challenge that we're seeing now is that the market has reacted in such a way, And therefore there's more pressure to deliver better results. And the way you can do that is reduce your costs.”Other tech companies are looking for ways to cut costs without eliminating jobs. Apple (AAPL), for instance, is reducing production of its iPhone 14 Plus, less than two weeks after the smartphone hit the market, according to The Information.Amazon (AMZN), which overextended itself during the pandemic boom, is looking to cut back on the number of warehouses it owns. It has shut down a number of projects including its delivery robot and a product that lets children video chat with distant family members.The downturn could be short lived, at least for techOn Tuesday, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos became the latest corporate titan to predict an economic downturn could come in the next few months. But according to BofA Global Research analyst Wamsi Mohan, such a decline could be short-lived if the Federal Reserve continues hiking rates.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.“If we go into a protracted downturn where inflation is persistently out of control, and we go into an economic slowdown or recession, where both of those are paired together, absolutely, there will be rationalization of jobs,” Mohan told Yahoo Finance.“But if we’re getting to the peak of rates somewhat quickly because the Fed is trying to do this in an accelerated way, we might end up in the first half of next year moving through most of the job cuts that are needed for companies to get back on the operating profit trajectory.”This week brought a sign that tech’s downturn might be fleeting. On Tuesday, Netflix reported better than expected quarterly results, beating earnings and revenue expectations and adding 2.4 million subscribers, after it had reported declines every quarter earlier this year.Netflix was one of the first big tech companies to lose its pandemic sheen, with subscribers sinking after millions signed up while quarantined. Perhaps, after spending time re-connecting with loved ones, Americans are finally ready to get back to their couches — and back to enjoying all that Big Tech has to offer.By Daniel Howley, tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

He contends that the chip shortage that began at the onset of COVID-19 forced people beyond the industry to understand the importance of semiconductors. Qualcomm's chips are in products as varied as mobile phones, laptops, connected cars, and VR devices.""People realized chips are an essential ingredient for the digital economy and when they look at economic growth,"" he told Yahoo Finance at Thursday's Qualcomm Ventures CEO Summit. ""When you think about the digital transformation of the enterprise, it’s necessary for companies that need to be more efficient. Chips become incredibly important for all of this because you need connectivity.”In other words, he said, “The story about chips is probably as good as it gets.""For now, the volatility of the stock market, high inflation and a hawkish Fed all pose challenges not only to Qualcomm, but to tech companies across the board — for instance, the Nasdaq 100 is down about 32% year-to-date as of Wednesday. Qualcomm's revenue and earnings for the last quarter beat analysts' expectations, and it's set to report its Q4 earnings in early November. The company's shares are down about 40% year-to-date.Chief Executive Officer and President of Qualcomm Incorporated Cristiano Amon speaks at a keynote conference during GSMA's 2022 Mobile World Congress (MWC), in Barcelona, Spain, March 1, 2022. REUTERS/Albert Gea“In the short-term, consistent with what we said in earnings, we have seen a little bit of a slowdown because of the macro,"" said Amon.As Qualcomm finds its way forward in the near-term, the company's diversification strategy — initiated by Amon when he took the helm in 2021 — is front-and-center. For example, Qualcomm Ventures, the company's VC arm, has been focused on investing in companies that build out Qualcomm's ecosystem in forward-looking areas like VR, said Qualcomm Ventures Global Head Quinn Li.Story continuesLi says it's a better time to invest than you might think.“If you look at the last cycle, a lot of big companies actually started and grew in difficult times,"" he said. ""So, from an investor’s perspective, we have the capital to deploy and I think it’s probably a better time to invest than it was the same time last year… I don’t think it’s necessarily a bad time.”A macro environment that's impossible to ignorePolitics have also affected the overarching chips environment, as President Joe Biden recently rattled the industry by restricting chip exports to China. The move grabbed headlines, and Amon said he was concerned in the near-term as to how it might affect chip demand. However, that's not the China-related situation that's most top-of-mind for Amon.“The other thing that’s happening right now is that China is in lockdown,"" he said. ""We’ve seen what’s happening in markets, and when you’ve got a lot of people locked down, you don’t go out and decide the best thing to do is buy a new phone. That has a huge impact on consumer spending.”It doesn't help that the headlines surrounding chip stocks haven't been great lately. Last week, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fell more than 4% before rebounding — another tough day on an index that's down more than 40% year-to-date.“The macro component here, you just can’t ignore it,” Amon said.Allie Garfinkle is a Senior Tech Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

The collaboration will bring Nvidia’s full accelerated computing stack — from GPUs to systems to software — to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).OCI will add tens of thousands of Nvidia GPUs, including the A100 and upcoming H100, to its capacity. Enterprises will also get a broad, accessible portfolio of options for AI training and deep learning.Nvidia and Oracle plan to make an upcoming release of Nvidia AI Enterprise available on OCI, offering customers access to Nvidia’s accelerated, secure and scalable platform for end-to-end AI development and deployment.Oracle is also offering early access to Nvidia RAPIDS acceleration for Apache Spark data, processing on the OCI Data Flow fully managed Apache Spark service.Data processing is one of the top cloud computing workloads. To support this demand, OCI Data Science plans to offer support for OCI bare-metal shapes, including BM.GPU.GM4.8 with Nvidia A100 Tensor Core GPUs, across managed notebook sessions, jobs and model deployment.The announcements fall into three broad categories. One is taking advantage of Nvidia AI software and layering it on to Oracle’s AI strategy. Oracle is focused on an Nvidia GPU solution that allows it to train AI models at scale. Lastly, Oracle is focusing on a real-time GPU, using the Nvidia MPI technology.

Oracle shares have declined 23.2% in the year-to-date period compared with the Zacks Computer - Software industry’s decline of 31.6%.As part of Oracle’s planned expansion of its cloud region footprint to support strong customer demand for OCI and Oracle Fusion Cloud Applications services worldwide, Oracle aims to open additional cloud regions in Colombia, Chile, and Israel and plans to offer at least 44 cloud regions.In first-quarter 2023, Oracle's total quarterly revenues were up 18% year over year, largely due to a 14% increase in cloud services and license support subscriptions. Total cloud services and license revenues for the quarter hit $8.4 billion — driven by Oracle Fusion Cloud, Oracle Autonomous Database and OCI Gen 2.Nvidia Clara, a healthcare AI and HPC application framework for medical imaging, genomics, natural language processing and drug discovery, will be coming soon. Oracle and Nvidia are also collaborating on new AI-accelerated Oracle Cerner offerings for healthcare, spanning areas such as analytics, clinical solutions, operations and patient management systems.An expanding clientele is enabling the company to maintain its leading position in the cloud ERP market. The healthy adoption of cloud-based applications, comprising NetSuite Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Fusion ERP and Fusion Human Capital Management (HCM), bode well for the long term.Partnerships with Accenture, Microsoft MSFT and VMware VMW are helping Oracle to win new clientele. The company’s share buybacks and dividend policy are noteworthy.Last quarter, Microsoft and Oracle delivered a high-speed interconnection between Azure and Oracle's cloud to give Azure customers direct access to Oracle databases. Multi-cloud interoperability is a major contributor to the growth of Oracle Database and Oracle's MySQL HeatWave database.Oracle’s partnership with VMware for Oracle Cloud VMware Solution has been gaining prominence, which is expected to have aided customer growth in the to-be-reported quarter. The solution has gained popularity among leading enterprises in retail, telecommunication, finance and banking, manufacturing, government and others.This Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company’s higher spending on product enhancements, especially on the cloud platform, amid increasing competition, is likely to limit margin expansion in the near term.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Top-line results were strong, too, reported at $4.4 billion and reflecting a strong 13% Y/Y uptick.Dan Durn, EVP and CFO, said, “Adobe achieved record revenue and strong profitability in the quarter, demonstrating that our products are mission-critical to individuals, small businesses and the world’s largest enterprises.”Story continuesNvidiaNvidia shares currently trade at a 47.5X forward earnings multiple, certainly not cheap by any stretch. However, the current value is nowhere near the steep 2021 highs of 93.5X during the semiconductor melt-up.While the company’s Gaming revenue has taken a hit amid a slowdown in demand, NVDA’s Data Center results are definitely worth highlighting – Data Center revenue climbed 61% Y/Y to $3.8 billion in its latest quarter, with sales from hyperscale customers nearly doubling.Nvidia’s Automotive results are undoubtedly worth a spotlight as well; Automotive revenue climbed a double-digit 45% Y/Y and 59% sequentially, with the strong growth driven by Auto AI Solutions (this includes AI Cockpit and Self-Driving revenue).While the company’s Gaming revenue has experienced quite a slowdown, other areas of its business are still enjoying strong growth.NVDA’s earnings are forecasted to decline by more than 20% in its current fiscal year (FY23), but things kick back into the green for FY24, with estimates calling for 30% growth.Further, revenue is forecasted to climb a marginal 1.8% in FY23 and a sizable 14% in FY24.AlphabetAlphabet shares could be the most enticing of all three – the company’s shares trade at a 19.2X forward earnings multiple, reflecting a 7% discount relative to its Zacks Computer and Technology sector.Further, the current value reflects a sizable 32% discount relative to the five-year median of 26.7X.GOOGL knows how to generate cash – Alphabet came in hot in its latest print, reporting quarterly free cash flow of $12.6 billion, the fourth highest of any S&amp;P 500 company in Q2.The company’s Google Cloud platform has been a notable success; in its latest quarter, Google Cloud revenue came in at $6.3 billion, reflecting a stellar 35.6% Y/Y uptick and a 9% sequential increase.Keeping a Long-Term MindsetIt’s been anything but fun for tech stocks in 2022, with a vast number witnessing double-digit percentage share price declines.However, amid all the negativity, long-term investors have been presented with a buying opportunity not seen in some time.Of course, there is always risk to the downside, but that’s why investors need to keep a long-term mindset, especially during uncertain times.Many strong companies, such as Nvidia, Adobe and Alphabet, have seen their valuation multiples pull back notably.Implementing a dollar-cost average strategy would be great for those looking to build up their positions and reap the rewards on the way back up.

IDXX is slated to report third-quarter 2022 results on Nov 1, before market open.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings per share of $1.56 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.3%. Moreover, earnings outpaced the consensus estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 5.84%.Let’s take a look at how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayThe Companion Animal Group (CAG) business is expected to have gained from consistent strong organic CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues backed by an increasing number of pet patients. With a gradual decline in pandemic severity, we anticipate growth in U.S. clinical visits to lead to substantial CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains in Q3. The CAG arm is also likely to gain from continued organic revenue growth in CAG diagnostic instruments, aided by strong execution trends and benefits from incremental price increases.Sales contributions from veterinary software and diagnostic imaging, including the benefits from the ezyVet acquisition, are likely to have been advantageous for the business in the to-be-reported quarter. The company’s veterinary software is also expected to report strong growth for the third quarter on gains from recurring software and digital imaging revenues and continued strong momentum in cloud-based software placements.IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseIDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseIDEXX Laboratories, Inc. price-eps-surprise | IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. QuoteIDEXX’s CAG premium instrument placements are expected to have recorded strong growth in Q3 on the continued rise in Catalyst and premium hematology placements. In the prior quarter, consumable gains were supported by 15% year-on-year growth in the global premium instrument installed base, reflecting double-digit increases across the company’s catalyst, premium hematology and SediVue platforms. Similar to the last reported quarter, we anticipate IDEXX to have recorded strong sales contributions from Rapid Assay in Q3. Strong customer retention backed by ProCyte One momentum and global expansion efforts in premium hematology placements are likely to have benefited the company’s CAG arm in Q3.Story continuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for CAG revenues is pegged at $755 million, suggesting an improvement of 3% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.IDEXX’s Water business is likely to have delivered impressive revenue performance on strong price gains. The business is expected to have benefited from a continued increase in water testing demand across the world as the effects of the pandemic abate and economies gradually recover from the pandemic.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Water revenues is pegged at $39.5 million, suggesting a rise of 3.5% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Within the Livestock, Poultry and Dairy (LPD) arm, we expect revenue growth in Q3 to have been impacted by lower African swine fever and core swine testing in China compared to the year-ago period. Apart from this, we expect a continued drop in human COVID testing revenues, similar to the second quarter, to have affected LPD sales performance in Q3.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LPD revenues is pegged at $28 million, suggesting a fall of 3.9% from the last reported quarter’s figure.Q3 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $830.4 million, suggesting a rise of 2.5% from the year-ago reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter 2022 net earnings of $2.04 per share indicates a 0.5% improvement from the year-ago reported figure.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) along with a positive Earnings ESP has a higher chance of beating estimates.

This compares to net income of $229 million, or $1.59 per diluted share, in the prior year period.Adjusted net income, which excludes a net expense of $5 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, in non-recurring costs related to the integration of Kaman Distribution Group (KDG), was $317 million, an increase of 17.3% compared to adjusted net income of $270 million for the same period of the prior year.

We were also pleased to further strengthen our balance sheet and generate continued strong cash flow.""The solid growth in Automotive was broad-based, with double-digit total sales growth in local currency in each of our global operations. Likewise, the continued strength in Industrial led to its sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales comps,"" said Mr. Stengel.Nine Months 2022 ResultsSales for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 were $16.6 billion, a 17.8% increase from $14.1 billion for the same period in 2021. Net income for the nine months was $931 million, or $6.53 per diluted share. The Company's adjusted net income was $896 million, or $6.29 per diluted share, an increase of 22.9% compared to $5.12 per diluted share last year.Balance Sheet, Cash Flow and Capital AllocationThe Company generated operating cash flow from operations of $1.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, an increase from $1.0 billion in the same period last year driven primarily by higher net income and effective management of our working capital. We used $1.7 billion in cash for investing activities, primarily in connection with the acquisition of KDG, in addition to $244 million for capital expenditures. We also had $386 million in cash provided by financing activities, which includes $961 million of net proceeds from debt, primarily related to the KDG acquisition. This was partially offset by quarterly dividends of $369 million paid to shareholders and $173 million of share repurchases. Free cash flow was $1.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, a 15% increase from $870 million for the nine months in 2021.The Company ended the quarter with $2.1 billion in total liquidity, consisting of $1.5 billion availability on the revolving credit facility and $629 million in cash and cash equivalents.2022 OutlookIn consideration of several factors, the Company is updating full-year 2022 guidance previously provided in its earnings release on July 27, 2022.

These items include adjusted net income from operations, adjusted diluted net income from operations per common share and free cash flow. We believe that the presentation of adjusted net income from operations, adjusted diluted net income from operations per common share and free cash flow, when considered together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to those measures, provide meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of our core operations. We considered these metrics useful to investors because they provide greater transparency into management's view and assessment of our ongoing operating performance by removing items management believes are not representative of our operations and may distort our longer-term operating trends. We believe these measures are useful and enhance the comparability of our results from period to period and with our competitors, as well as show ongoing results from operations distinct from items that are infrequent or not associated with our core operations. We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures as superior to, in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. We have included a reconciliation of this additional information to the most comparable GAAP measure following the financial statements below.Comparable SalesComparable sales is a key metric that refers to period-over-period comparisons of our sales excluding the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency and other. We consider this metric useful to investors because it provides greater transparency into management's view and assessment of the our core ongoing operations. This is a metric that is widely used by analysts, investors and competitors in our industry, although our calculation of the metric may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies, because not all companies and analysts calculate this metric in the same manner.Conference CallWe will hold a conference call today at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time to discuss the results of the quarter.

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Genuine Parts (GPC) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $2.05 a share one day away from its upcoming earnings release on October 20, 2022.GPC has an Earnings ESP figure of 0.82%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $2.05 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.03.GPC is part of a big group of Auto-Tires-Trucks stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at LKQ (LKQ) as well.LKQ is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on October 27, 2022. LKQ's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.97 a share eight days from its next earnings release.Story continuesFor LKQ, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.96 is 1.04%.GPC and LKQ's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Genuine Parts (NYSE:GPC). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. Check out our latest analysis for Genuine Parts How Quickly Is Genuine Parts Increasing Earnings Per Share?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Over the last three years, Genuine Parts has grown EPS by 14% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth.

So why not check out this free interactive visualization of Genuine Parts' forecast profits?Are Genuine Parts Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Insider interest in a company always sparks a bit of intrigue and many investors are on the lookout for companies where insiders are putting their money where their mouth is. That's because insider buying often indicates that those closest to the company have confidence that the share price will perform well. However, small purchases are not always indicative of conviction, and insiders don't always get it right.Story continuesIt's good to see Genuine Parts insiders walking the walk, by spending US$462k on shares in just twelve months. When you contrast that with the complete lack of sales, it's easy for shareholders to be brimming with joyful expectancy. Zooming in, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by Independent Director John Holder for US$261k worth of shares, at about US$119 per share.The good news, alongside the insider buying, for Genuine Parts bulls is that insiders (collectively) have a meaningful investment in the stock. Holding US$52m worth of stock in the company is no laughing matter and insiders will be committed in delivering the best outcomes for shareholders. This would indicate that the goals of shareholders and management are one and the same.Should You Add Genuine Parts To Your Watchlist?One important encouraging feature of Genuine Parts is that it is growing profits.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Genuine Parts is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for GPC in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $2.05 per share for GPC, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.03 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for GPC, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.82% heading into earnings season.Genuine Parts Company Price and EPS SurpriseGenuine Parts Company Price and EPS SurpriseGenuine Parts Company price-eps-surprise | Genuine Parts Company QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that GPC has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings.

Robinson Worldwide and Matson",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-industry-outlook-highlights-expeditors-091309362.html,1666257189,STORY,"['EXPD', 'CHRW', 'MATX', '^GSPC']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – October 20, 2022 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Expeditors International of Washington EXPD, C.H. Robinson Worldwide CHRW and Matson MATX.Industry: Transportation - ServicesLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/1993580/3-transport-services-stocks-to-watch-despite-industry-woesThe Zacks Transportation-Services industry is being hit by the inflation-induced extreme market volatility that characterized U.S. markets in the current year. Supply-chain woes and high-fuel costs are also denting the prospects of transport service providers.However, despite this gloom, there are some positives like impressive freight demand as economic activities gain pace following the easing of COVID-related restrictions. Stocks like Expeditors International of Washington, C.H. Robinson Worldwide and Matson are well-positioned to capitalize on this healthy demand environment.About the IndustryThe companies housed in the Zacks Transportation-Services industry offer transporters logistics, leasing and maintenance services. Some industry players focus on the business of global logistics management, including international freight forwarding. Third-party logistics entities provide innovative supply-chain solutions. They also focus on services like product sourcing, warehousing and freight shipping.The companies have expertise in trucking, air and ocean transportation. Additionally, some players in this industry deliver domestic and international express delivery services. The well-being of the companies in this industrial cohort is directly proportional to the health of the economy. An uptick in manufactured and retail goods, favorable pricing and improvement in global economic conditions bode well for the industry participants.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Transportation-Services IndustryFreight Demand Remains Impressive: Owing to the gradual recovery in economic activities, freight demand continues to be strong despite minor hiccups. This is supporting growth of the transport service providers. The Cass Freight shipments Index improved 4.8% year over year in September. The overall improving trend is evident from the fact that the measure has improved year over year in five (February, March, July, August and September) of the nine months reported so far this year.Story continuesEconomic Uncertainties a Woe: To tame the sky-high inflation in the United States, the Fed adopted a hawkish stance. Per the latest available data, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation for September 2022 was up 8.2% year over year. As a result of the higher-than-expected reading, the Fed, which has already raised its core interest rate 3% year-to-date, is likely to retain its interest-raising policy in its future meetings this year.  Higher interest rates result in the cost of borrowing moving north. This escalates the chances of an economic slowdown. Risks associated with economic slowdown, geopolitical tensions and supply-chain woes are hurting the prospects of stocks belonging to this industrial cohort.High Costs Hurting the Bottom Line: Operating expenses are on the rise, mainly due to increased fuel costs. Fuel expenses represent a key input cost for any transportation player. High oil price (up 48% in first-half 2022) is augmenting fuel costs. Even though oil price declined from its multi-year highs due to recession fears, it remains high.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Transportation - Services industry is a 28-stock group within the broader Zacks Transportation  sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #187, which places it in the bottom 25% of 250 plus Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates dismal near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. Since Mar 31, 2022, the industry's earnings estimates for 2022 have decreased 6.3%.Before we present a few stocks from the industry that you may want to consider, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and the valuation pictureIndustry Lags S&amp;P 500 and SectorThe Zacks Transportation-Services industry has underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and the broader Transportation sector over the past year.The industry has declined 27.8% over this period compared with the S&amp;P 500's depreciation of 21.8% and the broader sector’s plunge of 21.9%.Industry's Current ValuationBased on the forward 12-month price-to-sales, a commonly used multiple for valuing the Transportation-services stocks, the industry is currently trading at 1.41X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 3.06X.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s revenues and earnings is pegged at $37.7 billion and 37 cents a share, respectively.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ford’s third-quarter earnings per share has moved down by 17 cents in the past 30 days. The bottom-line projection implies a year-over-year decline of 27.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues, however, suggests a year-over-year increase of 10.7%.The U.S. auto biggie beat earnings estimates in the last reported quarter courtesy of higher-than-expected profits in its North America, South America and Europe segments. Over the trailing four quarters, Ford surpassed earnings estimates on two occasions for as many misses, with the average surprise being 24.5%. This is depicted in the graph below:Ford Motor Company Price and EPS SurpriseFord Motor Company Price and EPS SurpriseFord Motor Company price-eps-surprise | Ford Motor Company QuoteThings to NoteFord’s third-quarter revenues are likely to have been boosted by an increase in sales volume along with rising average prices of vehicles. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total wholesale shipments worldwide is pegged at 1,101,000 units, indicating an increase from 1,012,000 units in the year-ago period. Our projection for the same is 1,128,000 units, implying growth of 11.4% on a yearly basis. The consensus mark for revenues from automotive sales is $37,289 million, implying an uptick from $33,211 million recorded in the corresponding quarter of 2021. We project automotive revenues to grow 9% year over year to $36,194.5 million in the to-be-reported quarter.On the flip side, Ford issued a warning last month that its third-quarter 2022 profits are likely to take a hit in view of commodity cost headwinds stemming from exacerbated supply chain snarls and inflationary pressure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter adjusted automotive EBIT is pegged at $1,986 million, suggesting a fall from $2,459 million recorded in the year-ago period. Meanwhile, we project adjusted automotive EBIT to fall around 44% to $1,374 million.Story continuesThe consensus mark for revenues from Ford Credit is pegged at $2,314 million, implying a decrease from $2,434 million. Our estimate for the same is $2,356.2 million. The consensus mark for adjusted EBIT from the segment is $770 million, suggesting a fall from $1,077 million in the third quarter of 2021. We expect adjusted EBIT from the segment to contract 16% year over year.The consensus mark for revenues from Ford Mobility is pegged at $58 million, implying an increase from $38 million. Our estimate for the same is $65.9 million. The consensus mark for loss before interest and taxes from the segment is $270 million, widening from $258 million in the third quarter of 2021. We expect the bottom line from the segment to drop 13.1% year over year.It should be noted that F envisions third-quarter total adjusted EBIT to be $1.4-$1.7 billion, implying a drop from $3.7 billion recorded in the last reported quarter and $3 million earned in third-quarter 2021. The weak forecast is primarily attributed to $1 billion in added supplier costs for the three months ending September due to inflation and component shortages. Our estimates for total adjusted EBIT for the quarter under discussion imply a decline of more than 43%Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Ford for the to-be-reported quarter, as it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. This is not the case here.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: Ford has an Earnings ESP of -33.52%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate is pegged 13 cents lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Zacks Rank: It currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Stocks With the Favorable CombinationWhile an earnings beat appears uncertain for Ford, here are a few players from the auto space, which, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat for the quarter to be reported:Oshkosh OSK will release third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 27. The company has an Earnings ESP of +0.84% and a Zacks Rank #3.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Oshkosh’s to-be-reported quarter’s earnings and revenues is pegged at $1.16 per share and $2.14 billion, respectively.

Let’s take a deeper dive into the company’s recent quarterly print.Netflix Q3It was a much better-than-expected quarter for Netflix – revenue, operating income, and membership exceeded the company’s initial forecast, undoubtedly a major highlight.Netflix reported quarterly earnings of $3.10 per share, handily beating the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $2.11 by a double-digit 47%.The company generated $7.9 billion in revenue throughout the quarter, edging out the Zacks Consensus Sales Estimate by 1%.Following back-to-back quarters of subscriber losses, Netflix provided investors with much-needed positive news; NFLX added roughly 2.4 million net new paid subscribers, more than double the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 1.1 million, bringing the overall subscriber count to approximately 223.1 million.Further, the company’s lower-priced ad-supported plan is slated to be deployed in 12 countries in November, a massive step for the company.Netflix has been pushing the idea of an ad-supported tier for some time now, looking to add more ways to generate revenue. Netflix stated, “The reaction from advertisers so far has been extremely positive and we believe that more choice, especially for more price conscious consumers, will translate into meaningful incremental revenue and operating profit over time. That said, it’s still very early days and, since we’re keeping our existing plans ad-free, it will take us time to build up our membership base and the associated ad revenue.”Story continuesNFLX previously announced that Microsoft will be its technology and sales partner for its advertising venture.Additionally, Netflix has been undergoing a multi-year evolution of its content model; the company has been transforming its service from licensed second-run content to mostly Netflix originals.The evolution of its content model has proven successful; the streaming giant’s Q3 content portfolio was strong, with Stranger Things Season 4 generating roughly 1.4 billion hours viewed, NFLX’s biggest season of an English language series in its history.Netflix’s limited series, Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story, was also a significant hit, with it now being the second-largest English series in the company’s history with 824 million hours watched.Clearly, it was a strong quarter for the company, with two of its Q3 releases becoming their first and second most-watched English series of all time.The company also provided an optimistic view for its Q4 – it forecasts net new paid subscribers adds of a strong 4.5 million, and average revenue per membership (ARM) is expected to grow 6% Y/Y.Big CompetitionOne of Netflix’s biggest competitors is undoubtedly Disney with its Disney+ service.In fact, the Disney+ subscriber base actually overtook Netflix’s earlier in the year, with 221.1 million subscribers reported vs. Netflix’s roughly 220.7 million.With Netflix now reporting a subscriber base of 223.1 million in Q3, it’s taken back the throne.NFLX holding the title remains valid until Disney reports its Q4 results on November 11th.Disney+ has been growing at an unbelievable pace; the service added 14.4 million subscribers in its latest quarter.Further, DIS also plans to release an ad-supported tier for Disney+, slated to roll out on December 8th of this year, roughly a month after Netflix’s proposed initial rollout.Analysts have been bearish for the upcoming quarter, with four estimate revisions hitting the tape over the last several months. Still, the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $0.60 for DIS reflects a stellar 62% Y/Y uptick in earnings.With Netflix posting a better-than-expected quarter, it seems valid to question Disney’s upcoming quarterly results. The success that Disney+ has displayed has been remarkable, quickly catching up to Netflix. With seemingly no signs of subscriber slowdown, Disney+ can easily take back the top streaming position if it posts a strong quarter.This back-and-forth war between the two streaming titans will play out right before our eyes.Bottom LineNetflix shares have been the victim of a deep sell-off in 2022 thanks to a subscriber slowdown being a thorn in the company’s side.However, buyers have stepped up visibly for NFLX shares over the last three months, driving shares for a stellar run. Following the company’s better-than-expected Q3, shares skyrocketed in after-hours trading.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

That said, it’s still very early days and, since we’re keeping our existing plans ad-free, it will take us time to build up our membership base and the associated ad revenue.”Story continuesNFLX previously announced that Microsoft MSFT will be its technology and sales partner for its advertising venture.Additionally, Netflix has been undergoing a multi-year evolution of its content model; the company has been transforming its service from licensed second-run content to mostly Netflix originals.The evolution of its content model has proven successful; the streaming giant’s Q3 content portfolio was strong, with Stranger Things Season 4 generating roughly 1.4 billion hours viewed, NFLX’s biggest season of an English language series in its history.Netflix’s limited series, Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story, was also a significant hit, with it now being the second-largest English series in the company’s history with 824 million hours watched.Clearly, it was a strong quarter for the company, with two of its Q3 releases becoming their first and second most-watched English series of all time.The company also provided an optimistic view for its Q4 – it forecasts net new paid subscribers adds of a strong 4.5 million, and average revenue per membership (ARM) is expected to grow 6% Y/Y.Big CompetitionOne of Netflix’s biggest competitors is undoubtedly Disney DIS with its Disney+ service.In fact, the Disney+ subscriber base actually overtook Netflix’s earlier in the year, with 221.1 million subscribers reported vs. Netflix’s roughly 220.7 million.With Netflix now reporting a subscriber base of 223.1 million in Q3, it’s taken back the throne.NFLX holding the title remains valid until Disney reports its Q4 results on November 11th.Disney+ has been growing at an unbelievable pace; the service added 14.4 million subscribers in its latest quarter.Further, DIS also plans to release an ad-supported tier for Disney+, slated to roll out on December 8th of this year, roughly a month after Netflix’s proposed initial rollout.Analysts have been bearish for the upcoming quarter, with four estimate revisions hitting the tape over the last several months. Still, the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $0.60 for DIS reflects a stellar 62% Y/Y uptick in earnings.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWith Netflix posting a better-than-expected quarter, it seems valid to question Disney’s upcoming quarterly results. The success that Disney+ has displayed has been remarkable, quickly catching up to Netflix. With seemingly no signs of subscriber slowdown, Disney+ can easily take back the top streaming position if it posts a strong quarter.This back-and-forth war between the two streaming titans will play out right before our eyes.Bottom LineNetflix NFLX shares have been the victim of a deep sell-off in 2022 thanks to a subscriber slowdown being a thorn in the company’s side.However, buyers have stepped up visibly for NFLX shares over the last three months, driving shares for a stellar run. Following the company’s better-than-expected Q3, shares skyrocketed in after-hours trading.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Community solar allows customers to participate in the benefits of clean solar energy without installing panels on their own homes. Participants subscribe to a solar energy project and earn credits on their monthly utility bills for their portion of the energy produced by the solar project.Give-A-Ray is the first program of its kind in Illinois. The three projects serve a total of more than 560 customers, and ComEd pays their monthly subscription fees. Subscribers to the Rockford project started receiving monthly bill credits averaging $83 in August, and Kankakee participants began receiving credits in October. Give-A-Ray projects are open to income-eligible residents with an active ComEd account who live in the communities ComEd serves. While the three projects are currently fully subscribed, customers can learn more about the program requirements and register their interest for future openings at: www.ComEd.com/GiveARay.""We are encouraged to see ComEd customers taking advantage of Give-A-Ray as we continue to increase access to solar energy across northern Illinois, with a focus on our neighbors in under-resourced communities,"" said Scott Vogt, vice president of strategy and energy policy at ComEd. ""We are closely monitoring these projects and engaging subscribers through this three-year demonstration phase with an eye toward expanding the program. The future is bright for solar in Illinois, and we want everyone to be able to participate regardless of their income.""Story continues""The chance to participate in ComEd’s Give-A-Ray program could not come at a better time given the rising cost of energy and daily living,"" said Brenda Booth, who subscribes to the Rockford project. ""The savings on our energy bill are real and we’re happy to support the growth of clean energy in our community.""The Rockford Give-A-Ray project, developed by Trajectory Energy Partners of Illinois and owned and operated by Massachusetts-based Nexamp, Inc., is located on a previously empty field north of downtown. It has more than 6,600 solar panels with 2.6 megawatts (MW) of solar generation capacity. Trajectory Energy also developed the Gar Creek project in Kankakee while BW Fosler, Freeport, Ill., managed construction. The Gar Creek project is located in a low-income neighborhood and its two solar arrays contain a total of 12,000 solar panels with a combined solar generation capacity of 4.8 MW.""Community solar is unique as it offers customers access to the benefits of clean, solar energy by providing them with meaningful savings on their energy bill,"" said Nathaniel Dick, director of energy, Preservation of Affordable Housing, Inc., which supported enrollment in the Gar Creek Solar project. ""ComEd’s Give-A-Ray program is the best program we have seen to help reduce the energy burden at sites for low-to-moderate income families, some of whom will have zero-dollar energy bills in the coming months.""By the end of this year, ComEd expects to have more than 80 community solar projects interconnected to its grid and serving approximately 30,000 residential customers. The company estimates that it will increase solar generation on the ComEd system from a current level of almost 500 MW to 2,700 MW by 2030, including rooftop and community solar systems.

Higher provisions and lack of sequential loan growth weighed on investor sentiments.The results were adversely impacted by an increase in credit costs, higher expenses and a fall in non-interest income. Yet, a rise in net interest income (NII) on net interest margin expansion, higher rates and balance sheet strength offered some support.The net income available to common shareholders in the reported quarter was around $621 million, jumping 30% from the prior year.Revenues Jump on Higher NII, Expenses RiseM&amp;T Bank’s quarterly revenues totaled $2.24 billion, missing the consensus mark of $2.30 billion. Nonetheless, the reported figure jumped 46% year over year.NII, on a taxable-equivalent basis, surged 74% year over year to $1.7 billion. This was mainly driven by a higher net interest margin and the impact of earning assets from the People's United acquisition. The net interest margin expanded 94 basis points (bps) to 3.68%.The company’s non-interest income was $563 million, down 1%. Lower mortgage banking revenues mainly led to the fall.The non-interest expenses totaled $1.3 billion, flaring up 42%. The upsurge mainly stemmed from the impact of the acquisition of People's United. Excluding non-operating charges, the non-interest operating expenses were $1.2 billion.The efficiency ratio was 53.6%, down from 57.7% in the year-earlier quarter. A lower ratio indicates a rise in profitability.Loans and leases, net of unearned discount, were $128.2 billion at the end of the reported quarter, relatively stable from the prior quarter. The total deposits declined 4% to $163.8 billion.Story continuesCredit Quality DeterioratesThe net charge-offs increased 58% on a year-over-year basis to $63 million. The non-performing assets rose 9% to $2.5 billion. The company recorded a provision for credit losses of $115 million against a recapture of $20 million in the year-ago quarter.Nonetheless, the ratio of non-accrual loans to total net loans was 1.89%, down from 2.40% year over year.Capital &amp; Profitability Ratios StrongM&amp;T Bank’s estimated Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.7%, down from 11.1% as of Sep 30, 2020.

Balance sheet and revenue growth was primarily driven by its acquisition of People's United. The solid loan balance will likely continue aiding organic growth in the days to come. However, worsening credit quality and elevated expenses were headwinds.M&amp;T Bank Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseM&amp;T Bank Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseM&amp;T Bank Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | M&amp;T Bank Corporation QuoteCurrently, M&amp;T Bank carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The results included $959 million or 24 cents of net investment securities losses in the Corporate segment. Our estimate for earnings was $2.98 per share.Disappointing IB performance, bigger reserve build and increase in operating expenses hampered JPM’s quarterly performance to some extent.Truist Financial’s TFC third-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings of $1.24 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.26. The bottom line declined 12.7% from the prior-year quarter. Our estimate for earnings was $1.30.Results have been primarily hurt by a decline in non-interest income and higher provisions.

Don't Ignore These 2 Oils-Energy Stocks Set to Beat Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/want-better-returns-dont-ignore-130001566.html,1666184401,STORY,"['EQNR', 'STOHF', 'HP']","[Wall Street watches a company's quarterly report closely to understand as much as possible about its recent performance and what to expect going forward. Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Equinor (EQNR) holds a Zacks Rank #1 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $2.22 a share seven days away from its upcoming earnings release on October 26, 2022.EQNR has an Earnings ESP figure of 25.07%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $2.22 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.78.EQNR is one of just a large database of Oils-Energy stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Helmerich &amp; Payne (HP).Helmerich &amp; Payne, which is readying to report earnings on November 16, 2022, sits at a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $0.46 a share, and HP is 28 days out from its next earnings report.Helmerich &amp; Payne's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 10.12% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.42.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, EQNR and HP could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Discover how leading ESG companies are incorporating ESG factors into their corporate strategy, achieving meaningful impact and communicating with their stakeholders.For this edition, Randall Hopkins, Head of Nasdaq OneReport, spoke with Ken Gianella, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategy at Itron (ITRI). As a leader in ESG, Itron is helping cities and utilities better manage energy and water. ESG is embedded into Itron's corporate culture and provides an inspirational model for scalable impact. Hear from Gianella on how he and the Itron team continue to set the trend.How do you associate ESG with Itron's corporate strategy and purpose?ESG has been core to Itron's mission since our founding over 40 years ago. At Itron, we believe that the way we manage energy and water will define this century, and Itron has been enabling utilities and cities to safely, securely and reliably deliver critical infrastructure for energy and water to the customers and communities they serve more effectively and sustainably.Itron leverages a holistic approach that integrates our strategy, operational efforts and risk management with our ESG initiatives. Throughout Covid, our efforts have not changed. If anything, they have accelerated because our long-term view is focused on delivering products and services that support sustainability. When we hold our key stakeholders and ourselves accountable to these ESG principles and our mission, we will create a more resourceful and sustainable future for future generations.From your experience, what are some of the main benefits of completing ESG reporting in terms of valuation from an IR perspective, stakeholders and investors?Transparency and alignment. All stakeholders are looking to have insight into how your organization or company is keeping its commitments, whether they are societal, environmental, operational or financial. The addition of ESG reporting creates a nexus for organizations to be transparent and align all their stakeholders. That nexus is where companies show their stakeholders that they are not only doing well, but they are also doing good. We know the doing well part-which is the financial and operational performance that organizations have always reported on-but this has evolved over the last few years as stakeholders are now looking for more transparency and more alignment on doing good. By being just as transparent on your ESG reporting as you've been on your financial and operational reporting, you're able to keep all your stakeholders, both internal and external, aligned.Story continuesWhat are some of the main challenges you've experienced with ESG reporting?To start, I want to remind folks that it's not about the reporting-it's about driving the right environmental, social and governance outcomes for the stakeholders that you are representing. Being able to track and demonstrate the impact of your efforts as an organization is extremely important. To do this, there are two big challenges that we faced, one internal and the other external.The first challenge was ensuring that you have full alignment within your organization, from the board down to the rank and file, on what your goals are and how you are going to achieve them. The external challenge is that third-party reporting frameworks can be very daunting and challenging. In answering all of your stakeholders' requests, you quickly find out that your organization is going to get reporting fatigue pretty quickly. That's why it's important to get alignment internally and externally on what your targeted outcomes are going to be, and then you put in place the right processes, tools and partners before you begin the reporting process because it will save you a ton of time and headaches.How have you found the Nasdaq OneReport adds value to your journey as an ESG provider and reporter?First off, everything that we have discussed takes time and dedicated resources. Between the proliferation of third-party frameworks and the changing standards, it's a lot for any organization to keep up with. OneReport and the Nasdaq team have been awesome in supporting us and are great partners in helping us organize our way through the ESG reporting landscape. At Itron, we are dedicated to our ESG reporting efforts. Still, it takes time and effort. So, having the Nasdaq team help us navigate the different reporting standard changes and organize our thoughts in one place and with a collaborative tool, as OneReport does, has been extremely helpful in helping us on our journey.You mentioned the proliferation of frameworks. How do you think about prioritizing the different responses, or how do you keep track of which ones you should do first, as your organization gets inundated with new research organizations or frameworks coming online?It starts with our priorities and what we're trying to achieve, whether it be demonstrating our ability to become carbon neutral, supporting our customers and understanding their journey on what they need to do to reduce their carbon footprint or sharing more insights into how we're operating. When I talked earlier about understanding your internal and external goals, that was our very first step in doing that prioritization. Then you have to pick and choose. There are two buckets. There's that one bucket of the main external reports that you can do that can cover a wide swath of your investors and external stakeholders. Then there's a customer set of reports that you need to do from their supplier interactions with you that you need to do to be compliant. Using OneReport, we try to leverage the answers that we give to all the reports to be as fulsome as we can be, but we rank based upon priority for both internal and external stakeholders.Given that investor relations play a central role in ESG data management within Itron, how do you think about engaging other internal stakeholders?The first thing is it starts from the top. I would love to say that it's all IR-driven, but [Itron Chief Executive Officer] Tom Deitrich and our board really drive the meaning of what this is to the company from the top down. Getting alignment really isn't the issue when you have such great support from the top of the organization, but it's important for people to understand that ESG should not be this monolithic standalone pillar. It really should be deeply integrated into your organization, and so, as you're rolling out a program, helping people understand that this isn't just some extra reporting task you're doing, but you're really trying to find ways to report on how you make your organization more efficient and effective, not only for internal operations but also for how you're helping the global community out by reducing their global footprint of carbon and being socially responsible with how you operate the company.When you think about Itron's journey to date, can you describe the evolution within Itron? How do you think about 2022 and beyond; how do you think the future is likely to unfold for your organization and what you've observed more broadly?You can see the stakeholder pressure building up not only within our company but also within the industries that we serve, the utility industry and the smart-city industry. Being more vigilant and making sure that we're being transparent in our reporting is going to be more important than ever in 2022. While we've been serving this community and helping them decarbonize for over 40 years, we've taken an extra effort this year to make sure that we're not just reporting out stats or setting targets that are unachievable. We've been very focused on setting goals for ourselves and for our customers to help us really show a path to where we can decarbonize. You're going to see a lot more out of Itron as we find ways to decarbonize more efficiently and effectively and show how we can help our customers be more efficient and effective with their usage. Because the thing about the utilities and how they operate is if we don't find ways as customers to lower our overall usage and carve off that peak usage, it's very difficult for the utilities to reduce their carbon footprint. It's going to take us all working together. At Itron, we're going to really focus this year on helping the utilities and their customers find ways to be more efficient and effective.How do you think about the impact of your work, sitting at the intersection of utilities and consumers? How do you measure that or think about the impact of that work?At the heart of what we do is connecting utilities and their customers, and as much as people in society want to go after the utilities for causing greenhouse gas or being a major contributor to it, they forget that it's them, you and I, who actually create the need for that greenhouse gas to be generated. As we go through this energy transition, it's going to be more important than ever with the rise of the middle class and the electrification of the world; whether it be EVs or taking natural gas offline and making households more electrified, you're going to need more energy. During peak times, it's going to be important to find ways to reduce our load so that we can work through this energy transition and not have to bring on peaker plants and burn more fossil fuels in order to generate that energy. To give you some statistics, if society can reduce just one gigawatt of power a day, that's equivalent to burning four rail cars of coal. It's also equivalent to nine tanker trucks of gasoline being burned or 800 acres of forest trapping carbon for one year, or perhaps more relevantly, 86 million cellphones being charged simultaneously. Just by taking the effort to turn lights off or not plug in the hybrid during peak times or do things to change the way we behave day-to-day, we can make a difference. At Itron, we help our utilities connect to their customers to help send signals to them to find ways to reduce their overall load, and in the long run, make this a more resourceful world.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Nasdaq, Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Nasdaq, Inc.Website: https://www.nasdaq.com/solutions/corporate-esg-solutionsEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Nasdaq, Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/721036/ESG-Trendsetters-Itron]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of Third Point's strategy and Daniel Loeb's background and go directly to the 5 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Dan Loeb.Daniel Loeb is the founder and CEO of Third Point. He graduated from the University of Columbia with a degree in economics in 1983. Soon after his graduation, he started his career in the investment sector by working at Warburg Pincus, a private equity firm. Over the course of his successful career, Daniel served on boards of several publicly traded companies, including Massey Energy, Ligand Pharmaceuticals, and Sotheby's. On October 2020, he was awarded the Alexander Hamilton Award for his philanthropic service by the Manhattan Institute.Third Point is a hedge fund based out of New York, which was launched in 1995 by Daniel Loeb. The fund invests in equity as well as fixed-income markets and invests in value stocks with a long-term view to generate outsized returns for its investors. At the end of Q2 2022, Third Point's investment in the equity market amounted to over $4.2 billion. The firm holds a concentrated portfolio with PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) as its biggest holding.Our MethodologyWe picked the top 10 stocks from Third Point's portfolio as of Q2 2022.10.

Third Point continued to add onto its investment in Cenovus Energy Inc. (NYSE:CVE), as it increased its stake in the company by 264% during the second quarter. The total investment value of the fund in Cenovus Energy Inc. (NYSE:CVE) amounted to approximately $138 million at the end of Q2 2022.Story continuesOn October 14, 2022, Jason Bouvier, an analyst at Scotiabank, trimmed his price target to C$33 while maintaining an Outperform rating on the company's shares. Cenovus Energy Inc. (NYSE:CVE) has outperformed the market in 2022 and is up 48.7% YTD.L1 Capital mentioned the firm in its Q2 2022 investor letter, outlining that:MEG Energy and Cenovus Energy Inc. (NYSE:CVE): We continue to remain positive on the outlook for Energy. While a potential U.S. recession would result in softer oil demand, we believe this would be more than outweighed by China re-opening over the coming year (which would see a major lift in car and air traffic). Oil supply continues to remain constrained with sustained declines in global inventories and OPEC+ remains unable to grow production significantly. With the sell-off in energy stocks, MEG and Cenovus are currently generating more than 20% of their market cap in cash flow with large dividends and share buybacks to come.Cenovus Energy (Long +14%) shares rallied driven by continued strong free cash flow generation, as well as being positioned to benefit from strong refining margins and downstream operations. The company recently announced a significant increase in dividends, which gives us greater confidence on the potential for a 100% return of free cash flow generation via dividends and buybacks from early CY23. Given the long-life nature of its oil sand assets and its low cost of production, we estimate the company is free cash flow break-even at an oil price of ~US$40/bbl. At present, oil prices are more than double this break-even point, implying considerable upside to consensus cash flow estimates (if prices remain near current levels). There are also additional value realisation catalysts with the company continuing to progress the de-gearing of its balance sheet via organic cash generation and asset sales.At the end of Q2 2022, Soroban Capital Partners remained the leading stakeholder of the company, with a holding of 50,338,822.

Although the analyst has an Overweight rating on the shares, he believes that margins in the railroad sector will continue to face pressure in the short term due to volume decline and labor issues.Clearbridge Investments mentioned CSX Corporation (NYSE:CSX) in their Q4 2021 investor letter. This is what they had to say:On a regional basis, the U.S. and Canada was the top contributor to quarterly performance, of which U.S. rail operators CSX (NYSE:CSX) was among the lead performers. CSX (NYSE:CSX) is one of five leading North American rail companies, with over 21,000 miles of rail, covering 23 states and 40+ ports. CSX (NYSE:CSX) is engaged in the transportation of rail freight in the Southeast, East, and Midwest via interchange with other rail carriers, to and from the rest of the U.S. and Canada. CSX (NYSE:CSX) performed well during the quarter after the company beats market expectations on its third-quarter results. The beats were largely driven by strong pricing, which could be hitting record highs, and healthy commodity/coal volume driven by the current energy crisis.As per Insider's Monkey database, 63 hedge funds owned stakes in Cheniere Energy, Inc. (NYSE:LNG) at the end of the June quarter.  Soroban Capital Partners was the most bullish fund on the company's stock, with a total holding of 52,600,295.8. Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL)Third Point Stake: $159,078,000 Percentage of Third Point's Portfolio: 3.76%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) has developed to become a significant worldwide consumer goods company since its establishment in 1806. Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) was a new addition to the fund's portfolio during the second quarter as Dan Loeb purchased 1,985,000 shares of the company.On October 14, 2022, Peter Grom, an analyst at UBS, reduced his price target on the company to $80 while maintaining a Buy rating on the stock. The analyst believes that Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) has a strong history of surviving in all business cycles and will continue to do well, but the foreign exchange impact due to the appreciation of the US dollar will have an adverse impact on the company.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, First Eagle Investments Global Fund mentioned Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) and explained its insights for the company. Here is what the fund said:Shares of consumer staples giant Colgate-Palmolive have performed well as investors rotated into more recessionary-resilient defensive stocks amid the broader selloff during the second quarter. The company raised revenue guidance for 2022 but lowered its margin outlook because of higher costs for raw materials, packaging and logistics; we believe that the company's size and market share provide it with options to mitigate the inflation challenges it faces. We continue to like Colgate- Palmolive's dividend and previously announced $5 billion stock buyback program.7. DuPont de Nemours, Inc. (NYSE:DD)Third Point Stake: $171,186,000 Percentage of Third Point's Portfolio: 4.05%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44DuPont de Nemours, Inc. (NYSE:DD) is a multinational specialty chemicals firm that was established in 2019. Third Point decreased its stake in the company during the second quarter as the fund sold 9% of its stake. The firm's investment value at the end of Q2 2022 amounts to approximately $171 million.On October 10, 2022, P.J. Juvekar, an analyst at Citi, made a downward revision to his price target on DuPont de Nemours, Inc. (NYSE:DD). The analyst now has a price target of $67 on the company's shares. He believes that chemical companies will not thrive at least till spring next year as global economies face a recession and the spending in the housing and construction sector slows down.Here is what Rhizome Partners has to say about DuPont de Nemours, Inc. (NYSE:DD) in its Q1 2021 investor letter:We have written extensively about the anticipated DuPont's Reverse Morris Trust merger with International Flavors and Fragrances (IFF) in January of 2021. During the quarter, DuPont shares traded up significantly in anticipation of the deal. We tendered about 40% of our DuPont shares for IFF and received about half of the allocation due to pro-ration. Investors are finally starting to appreciate DuPont's effort to cut costs, streamline operations, and spin off companies into pure-play companies that trade at higher multiples. We are still getting used to the higher multiples that investors will pay for larger market cap and pure play companies such as DuPont.6. EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT)Third Point Stake: $258,860,000 Percentage of Third Point's Portfolio: 6.12%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) is a producer of natural operating in the United States.

The analyst has a price target of $65 on the company's stock and believes that the management of the company has taken effective cost management measures. Along with that, the analyst argues that gas prices are expected to remain elevated in the future, which will lead to better performance for the company in 2023.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks, and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:We initiated a position in EQT (NYSE:EQT), the largest natural gas producer in the U.S., which possesses high-quality acreage within the Marcellus Shale basin. EQT has benefited from tight supply and demand dynamics as cleaner-burning natural gas takes global share from coal and exports to Europe and Asia provide an avenue of demand growth. Longer-term contracts enhance EQT's earnings visibility as Europe eliminates its dependence on Russian gas. Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Dan Loeb.Suggested articles:10 Best International Stocks To Buy Today10 Best Hurricane Stocks To Invest InBest Golf Stocks To Buy Now Disclosure: None. 10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Dan Loeb is originally published on Insider Monkey. ]"

Swiss Re estimates claims stemming from Hurricane Ian claims in the range of $50 billion to $65 billion. The Progressive Corporation incurred $760 million of catastrophe losses due to Hurricane Ian in the third quarter of 2022 that weighed on its quarterly results. Arch Capital Group expects pre-tax net catastrophe losses of $530 million to $560 million across the property casualty insurance and reinsurance segments for the third quarter.Story continuesInsurers witnessed improved pricing in the third quarter of 2022. An active catastrophe environment accelerated the policy renewal rate and aided better pricing. These, coupled with reinsurance programs, favorable reserve development and solid capital level, are likely to have aided underwriting profitability.Insurers, being beneficiaries of an improving rate environment, are expected to come up with improved investment results. The third quarter itself saw two rate hikes.  A larger investment asset base and alternative investments in private equity, hedge funds, and real estate, among others, coupled with an improving rate environment, are expected to have aided net investment income, an important component of insurers’ top line.Life insurers have been redesigning products by moving away from guaranteed savings products toward protection products of unit-linked savings products. Also, life insurers continue to roll out investment products that provide bundled covers of guaranteed retirement income, life and healthcare to cater to customers preferring policies with “living” benefits more than those with death benefits. Increasing demand for protection products is likely to have driven sales.The insurance industry continues to invest in digitalization. Accelerated digitalization is likely to have saved costs and driven margin expansion.Banking on operational efficiency resulting in a solid capital position, insurers continue to engage in strategic mergers and acquisitions, build on a niche, expand globally, diversify their portfolio and deploy capital to make dividend hikes and pay special dividends.

361,729e11b3-736b-3eae-9fe0-8094ff85048a,DVN,2022-10-20,Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) shareholders have earned a 59% CAGR over the last three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/devon-energy-nyse-dvn-shareholders-132048690.html,1666185648,STORY,['DVN'],"[It might seem bad, but the worst that can happen when you buy a stock (without leverage) is that its share price goes to zero. But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. For example, the Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) share price has soared 238% in the last three years. Most would be happy with that. On top of that, the share price is up 21% in about a quarter.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. Check out our latest analysis for Devon Energy To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Devon Energy was able to grow its EPS at 45% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. We don't think it is entirely coincidental that the EPS growth is reasonably close to the 50% average annual increase in the share price. This observation indicates that the market's attitude to the business hasn't changed all that much. Quite to the contrary, the share price has arguably reflected the EPS growth.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how Devon Energy has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. Take a more thorough look at Devon Energy's financial health with this free report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Devon Energy the TSR over the last 3 years was 304%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Devon Energy has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 87% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 20%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Devon Energy   (of which 1 doesn't sit too well with us!) you should know about.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

Inflation is up, returns are down and retirement accounts are taking it on the chin. There’s probably nothing that would make you feel better more than some safe, high-yield dividend stocks to buy.While there’s no sure thing when it comes to investing, you can tip the odds greatly in your favor by investing in equities that are safe high-yield dividend stocks. Dividend stocks are some of the safest investments you can make.I love dividend stocks because they pay you to hold them, and you can take the monthly or quarterly income and reinvest it in the market to turbocharge your portfolio growth.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe stock market is surely challenging right now. So consider these safe high-yield dividend stocks:SJTSan Jan Basin Royalty Trust $10.01UANCVR Partners$121.93ABRArbor Realty Trust$12.20OMFOneMain Holdings$32.71GNKGenco Shipping &amp; Trading$14.05APAMArtisan Partners Asset Management$26.62SCCOSouthern Copper Corporation$47.08 San Juan Basin Royalty Trust (SJT)In the field, the oil pump in the evening, the evening silhouette of the pumping unit, the silhouette of the oil pump. Oil stocks and energy stocksSource: zhengzaishuru / Shutterstock.comI’ll be the first to admit that San Jan Basin Royalty Trust (NYSE:SJT) isn’t on everyone’s radar. Maybe that’s why I like it. Or maybe it’s because of the solid payout record.San Juan Basin Royalty Trust owns royalty interests in oil and gas properties in the San Juan basin of New Mexico. It pays out royalties in the form of distributions, which can be really attractive when oil prices are high, as they have been recently.Despite a recent pullback, SJT stock is up 69% so far this year and it has a monthly dividend yield of 14.4%. Earnings for the second quarter included revenue of $13.72 million (up 81.4% from a year ago) and a profit margin of 97.2%.SJT stock has an “A” rating in the Dividend Grader.CVR Partners (UAN)A tractor spreading fertilizer over a farm field.Source: Fotokostic / Shutterstock.comCVR Partners (NYSE:UAN) is a master limited partnership in the fertilizer business. As the price of fertilizer spiked this year following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, UAN stock has been the beneficiary.Story continuesAt one point this year, UAN stock was more than $177 per share and showed gains of over 110%. But even with a recent pullback, CVR Partners is still showing a gain of over 55%. And the war in Ukraine shows no signs of letting up. CEO Mark Pytosh told analysts in August that war tensions will likely keep prices of fertilizer elevated for the rest of the year.Earnings for the second quarter included revenue of $244 million, which was up 76.8% from a year ago, and earnings per share of $11.12. Currently paying a dividend of 16.4%, it has a solid “A” rating in the Dividend Grader.Arbor Realty Trust (ABR)the Arbor Realty Trust (ABR) logo on a web browser, magnified by a magnifying glassSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comArbor Realty Trust (NYSE:ABR), a New York-based lender, handles direct-lending services for multi-family and commercial real estate. It handles everything from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loan programs, FHA and low-income loans, bridge loans and more.Earnings for the second quarter included revenue of $94.26 million, which was better than analysts’ expectations of $82.38 million. Earnings per share came in at 52 cents, better than the 43 cents that the Street was expecting.And to top it off, ABR stock offers a whopping dividend yield of 12.7%, which helps take the sting off the stock’s year-to-date loss of more than 30%.ABR stock has an A rating in the Dividend Grader.OneMain Holdings (OMF)Picture of a loan agreement with a pen.Source: William Potter / ShutterstockOneMain Holdings (NYSE:OMF) is an Indiana-based company that is one of the nation’s biggest personal installment loan companies.It specializes in working with customers with low credit scores – something that may be more common with the nation battling high inflation and the threat of a recession.However, the market hasn’t been kind to shareholders in recent months. OMF stock is down 33% so far in 2022, including a drop of 12% in the last three months.Earnings in the most recent quarter were also a disappointment, with OneMain recording $1.04 billion in Q2 revenue, missing estimates of $1.05 billion. Earnings per share of $1.87 missed analysts’ estimates by a dime.However, OneMain takes the sting off that performance by offering a solid dividend yield of 11.8%, helping give it an “A” rating in the Dividend Grader.Genco Shipping &amp; Trading (GNK)Genco Shipping cargo ship in Russia. GNK stock.Source: Pres Panayotov / ShutterstockIf you’re familiar with supply chain and shipping challenges around the world – a common theme since the outbreak of Covid-19 in 2020 – then you probably have some appreciation for Genco Shipping &amp; Trading (NYSE:GNK).The company provides dry bulk transportation services for shipping grain, coal, iron ore and other commodities around the globe. It owns a fleet of 44 Capesize, Ultramax and Supramax ships that it rents out for more than $27,000 per day. That provides some solid cash flow for shareholders.Earnings for the second quarter included revenue of $105.3 million, beating expectations of $103.88 million. EPS of $1.10 was less than expectations of $1.17, however.Even so, GNK provides an outstanding dividend yield of 14.8%, which helps push it into an “A” rating in the Dividend Grader.Artisan Partners Asset Management (APAM)Artisan Partners (APAM) logoSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comYou may think of this as another one of those under-the-radar picks, but I’ve had my eye on Artisan Partners Asset Management (NYSE:APAM) for a long time. In fact, it was on my list of top dividend stocks to buy for 2022.The Wisconsin-based company provides investment management services, primarily to commercial customers. It has more than $120 billion in assets under management and maintains offices in major cities in the U.S. and around the world.Earnings for the second quarter were a minor disappointment, with revenue of $251.4 million and EPS of 79 cents per share missing analysts’ estimates of $253.82 million and EPS of 85 cents. But with a dividend yield of nearly 13%, APAM stock still has a “B” rating in my Dividend Grader.Southern Copper Corporation (SCCO)Southern Copper Corporation logo on a phone screen in front of the logo on a computer screen. SCCO stock.Source: viewimage / ShutterstockSouthern Copper Corporation (NYSE:SCCO) produces refined gold, silver, copper and other precious metals, with its primary operations being in South America. It operates as an indirect subsidiary of Grupo Mexico SAB de CV (OTCMKTS:GMBXF).While the prices for some precious metals fall in a rising interest-rate environment, many metals are critical to manufacturing. The demand for gold is expected to grow by a compound annual growth rate of 3.1% between now and 2026.SCCO stock is down 21% on the year – slightly worse than the Dow Jones Industrial Average, but slightly better than the S&amp;P 500. The performance is certainly in the middle of the pack. But commodities provide some baseline security for investors, particularly in a challenging market, and are a good way to diversify a portfolio.When you add in a dividend yield of 8.5%, you can see why Southern Copper still gets an “A” rating in the Dividend Grader.On the date of publication, neither Louis Navellier nor the InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article held (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Louis Navellier, who has been called “one of the most important money managers of our time,” has broken the silence in this shocking “tell all” video… exposing one of the most shocking events in our country’s history… and the one move every American needs to make today.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayEarly Bitcoin Millionaire Reveals His Next Big Crypto Trade “On Air”It doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis equipment rental company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $9 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +36.8%.Revenues are expected to be $3.09 billion, up 19% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.33% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for United Rentals?For United Rentals, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.46%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that United Rentals will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that United Rentals would post earnings of $6.57 per share when it actually produced earnings of $7.86, delivering a surprise of +19.63%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.United Rentals appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Oracle What's The Estimated Valuation?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$11.1bUS$13.4bUS$15.9bUS$19.0bUS$20.3bUS$21.2bUS$22.1bUS$22.8bUS$23.5bUS$24.1bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x14Analyst x15Analyst x9Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 4.73%Est @ 3.91%Est @ 3.33%Est @ 2.92%Est @ 2.64% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.0% US$10.2kUS$11.5kUS$12.6kUS$14.0kUS$13.8kUS$13.4kUS$12.9kUS$12.3kUS$11.8kUS$11.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$124bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.0%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$24b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (8.0%– 2.0%) = US$410bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$410b÷ ( 1 + 8.0%)10= US$190bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$314b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$66.3, the company appears quite undervalued at a 43% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Oracle as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.281. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Oracle, there are three relevant items you should assess:Risks: For instance, we've identified   4 warning signs for Oracle (2 are concerning)  you should be aware of.Future Earnings: How does ORCL's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

If you want to skip our industry introduction and jump ahead to the top five stocks in this list, then head on over to 5 Best Machine Learning Stocks to Buy. Machine learning refers to a set of technologies that enable researchers and others to use large or small datasets to their advantage by making predictions. It often requires breaking the data set into pieces, and depending on the size of the data set, often requires large amounts of computing power too.The basics of machine learning involve two kinds, supervised and unsupervised. In the former, the data set is assigned categories for the conclusions that the software has to reach, and this also involves dividing the data into two sets - one for training the algorithm and the other for testing it. The latter simply involves the software itself identifying the 'interesting' details about the data, and one such technique is principal component analysis, which determines the key explanatory factors of a data set.These techniques have transformed the manner in which corporations handle their data, and one strong beneficiary is supply chain management. Big and small enterprise resource planning software providers now provide machine learning as part of their software suites, and companies use them regularly to drive data driven insights that would have been science fiction just a couple of decades ago.Therefore, the machine learning industry has one of the strongest compounded annual growth rates (CAGRs) that we have come across. For instance, a report from Fortune Business Insights assigns the industry with an astounding CAGR of 38.8% for the time period spanning between 2022 and 2029. It estimates that the sector will be worth $21 billion by the end of this year, and through strong CAGR, it will go on to be worth a whopping $210 billion in just seven years. Driving this demand will be the healthcare sector, as automated data analysis will provide companies with advanced ways of spearheading drug discovery. Healthcare has already proven pivotal for machine learning as drug makers relied on the technology to develop vaccines for the coronavirus pandemic.Story continuesA report from Market Research Future ascribes a similar 38.8% CAGR to the industry and it estimates that by the end of 2030, the machine learning industry will be worth $106 billion. Among the different segments that make up this industry, such as software developers, enterprise resource planning systems providers, and hardware manufacturers, Market Research Future believes that the hardware segment is slated to benefit the most, and enterprise machine learning will have the strongest demand.Therefore, the future is bright for machine learning, and today we will identify the key players in the industry. Some top names likely to catch your attention are Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).Our  Methodology We took a broad look at the industry and identified the different segments that it is divided into. Then, the key players in each segment were identified based on market trends, product strengths, and financial performance. They were then ranked according to hedge fund interest courtesy of Insider Monkey's 895 hedge fund survey for Q2 2022.Best Machine Learning Stocks to Buy11.

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Synchrony (SYF) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.62 a share, just six days from its upcoming earnings release on October 25, 2022.By taking the percentage difference between the $1.62 Most Accurate Estimate and the $1.45 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Synchrony has an Earnings ESP of 11.33%.SYF is part of a big group of Finance stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Public Storage (PSA) as well.Public Storage is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on November 1, 2022. PSA's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $4.10 a share 13 days from its next earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Public Storage is $4.05, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 1.34%.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, SYF and PSA could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

This compares to FFO of $1.04 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an FFO surprise of 3.59%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this industrial real estate developer would post FFO of $1.12 per share when it actually produced FFO of $1.11, delivering a surprise of -0.89%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates three times.Prologis , which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry, posted revenues of $1.15 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.97%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.04 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Prologis shares have lost about 37.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -22%.What's Next for Prologis?While Prologis has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's FFO outlook. Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Prologis: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. (PG), The Coca-Cola Co. (KO) and TotalEnergies SE (TTE). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Procter &amp; Gamble have declined -9.5% over the past year against the S&amp;P 500 decline of -19.9%. The company is going through a phase of unfavorable mix, commodity cost inflation, increase in freight costs, product and packaging investments and other impacts that hurt margins. It expects higher commodity and freight costs to persist in fiscal 2023.That said, what has helped the stock hold its ground in the ongoing market sell off is the stability and resilience of its business across all stages of the economic cycle. We saw this in the last quarterly report and will most likely get more confirmation of that in the Q3 earnings report on October 19th.Management issued a favorable view for fiscal 2023 at the time of the last quarterly release. It witnessed SG&amp;A expense leverage, owing to savings from overhead and marketing expenses, and cost leverage gains due to higher sales and real estate.(You can read the full research report on Procter &amp; Gamble here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Story continuesCoca-Cola shares have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over the past year (+2.9% vs. -19.9%). The company’s top and bottom lines surpassed estimates for the sixth straight quarter in the last quarterly report on July 26th and it is reasonable to expect a replay of that performance in next week's Q3 release. The company’s results reflect elasticity in the marketplace despite the ongoing global challenges. Sales gained from revenue growth across its operating segments, aided by an improved price/mix and an increase in concentrate sales.Coca-Cola benefited from underlying share gains in both at-home and away-from-home channels. It raised the organic revenues and comparable earnings per share growth guidance for 2022. It is poised to gain from innovations and accelerating digital investments.However, pressures from higher supply chain costs, including transportation and input costs remain. Higher marketing spends and currency headwinds are also concerning.(You can read the full research report on Coca-Cola here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of TotalEnergies have declined -1.0% over the past year against the S&amp;P 500 decline of -19.9%. The company’s production is impacted by the natural decline in the oil and natural gas fields. It remains exposed to acquisition-related risks as these assets contribute a sizable volume to production. TotalEnergies operates in some politically-troubled regions, and the ongoing Russia and Ukraine conflict might affect profitability.However, TotalEnergies continues to gain from startups, increased commodity prices, well-spread LNG assets and an expanding upstream portfolio that has exposure to fast-growing hydrocarbon-producing regions.TTE streamlines its portfolio through acquisitions, partnerships and divestitures.

388,0984acac-5eb7-3678-8468-71d7e55e35a1,STX,2022-10-20,Analysts Estimate Seagate (STX) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-seagate-stx-report-140102303.html,1666188062,STORY,['STX'],"[The market expects Seagate (STX) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 26, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis electronic storage maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.68 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -71.1%.Revenues are expected to be $2.1 billion, down 32.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Seagate?For Seagate, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -5.88%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #5.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Seagate will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Seagate would post earnings of $1.89 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.59, delivering a surprise of -15.87%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Seagate doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

On average, about 68% of large-cap funds underperform their benchmarks, but this study shows that only 51% underperformed benchmark indices in the first half of 2022. Market capitalization is largely used as an indicator to judge a company's financial performance and business outlook. Large-cap stocks have a reputation for offering quality goods and services, and a resilient profile of dividend payments and steady growth.

394,bc42fbcc-f572-3b63-99f4-9bdd7046813f,FTI,2022-10-20,FMC Technologies (FTI) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fmc-technologies-fti-earnings-expected-140102692.html,1666188062,STORY,"['FTI', 'NEX']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when FMC Technologies (FTI) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 26. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis provider of equipment and services to energy companies is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.09 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +250%.Revenues are expected to be $1.75 billion, up 10.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for FMC Technologies?For FMC Technologies, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +6.40%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that FMC Technologies will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that FMC Technologies would post earnings of $0.04 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.02, delivering a surprise of -50%.The company has not been able to beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.FMC Technologies appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsNexTier Oilfield Solutions (NEX), another stock in the Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.50 for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +554.6%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $921.72 million, up 134.4% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for NexTier Oilfield Solutions has been revised 15.6% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 1.00%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), suggests that NexTier Oilfield Solutions will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.

In a dynamic environment, the underlying health of our business remains resilient given our needs-based, demand-driven product categories, best-in-class customer service and customer relationship management capabilities. I want to thank the entire Tractor Supply team for their hard work to deliver our strong third quarter results, their dedication to advance our strategic plans to deliver sustainable long-term growth and their commitment to living our Mission and Values,"" said Hal Lawton, Tractor Supply’s President and Chief Executive Officer.""Our Life Out Here strategy is gaining traction and widening our competitive moat, and we are excited about the many growth vectors ahead. We are honored to welcome the Orscheln Farm and Home team to Tractor Supply. With 25% of our store base now in our Project Fusion store format and over 260 Garden Centers operating across the chain, we are on track to achieve major milestones in the history of Tractor Supply with net sales exceeding $14 billion, more than 2,100 Tractor Supply stores and 50,000 dedicated Team Members. We believe we have the right strategies to manage through the near-term and to deliver long-term balanced growth and value creation,"" said Lawton.Story continuesThird Quarter 2022 ResultsNet sales for the third quarter of 2022 increased 8.4% to $3.27 billion from $3.02 billion in the third quarter of 2021. Comparable store sales increased 5.7%, as compared to an increase of 13.1% in the prior year's third quarter. Comparable store sales for the third quarter of 2022 were driven by comparable average ticket growth of 7.0%, partially offset by a comparable average transaction count decline of 1.3%. Comparable store sales growth reflects continued strength in every day, needs-based merchandise, including consumable, usable and edible (""C.U.E."") products and year-round product categories.Gross profit increased 7.4% to $1.17 billion from $1.09 billion in the prior year's third quarter, and gross margin decreased 32 basis points to 35.6% from 36.0% in the prior year's third quarter. The gross margin rate decrease was primarily attributable to product mix from the robust growth of C.U.E. products as the Company's price management actions and other margin driving initiatives were able to offset the impact from significant product cost inflation pressures and higher transportation costs.Selling, general and administrative (""SG&amp;A"") expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased 9.0% to $859.4 million from $788.1 million in the prior year's third quarter. As a percent of net sales, SG&amp;A expenses increased 16 basis points to 26.3% from 26.1% in the third quarter of 2021. The increase in SG&amp;A as a percent of net sales was primarily attributable to the Company’s strategic growth initiatives, including depreciation and amortization, and investments in hourly wages and benefits. These items were partially offset by a moderation of COVID-19 response costs, more normalized incentive compensation, and leverage in occupancy and other costs from the increase in comparable store sales.Operating income increased 3.1% to $306.4 million compared to $297.2 million in the third quarter of 2021.The effective income tax rate improved to 22.0% compared to 22.9% in the third quarter of 2021 due to certain state tax credits.Net income increased 4.3% to $234.1 million from $224.4 million, and diluted earnings per share increased 7.7% to $2.10 from $1.95 in the third quarter of 2021.The Company repurchased approximately 0.6 million shares of its common stock for $123.6 million and paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $101.9 million, returning $225.5 million of capital to shareholders in the third quarter of 2022.The Company opened 11 new Tractor Supply stores and two new Petsense by Tractor Supply stores in the third quarter of 2022.Fiscal 2022 Financial OutlookThe Company is updating its fiscal 2022 financial guidance, previously provided on July 21, 2022, to reflect the strong performance year to date and its outlook for the fourth quarter of 2022. The Company’s fiscal 2022 financial outlook has been updated for the recent acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home which closed on October 12, 2022. The acquisition is anticipated to add approximately $75 million to net sales in the fourth quarter and fiscal 2022. Given the transaction expenses and early implementation costs to be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022, the impact of the acquisition is expected to be relatively neutral to operating income in the fourth quarter and for the fiscal year.Fiscal 2022 comprises 53 weeks, one additional week compared to fiscal 2021. The fiscal 2022 guidance includes a benefit for the 53rd week, which is estimated to be approximately 1.5 percentage points of net sales and $0.15 of diluted EPS.For fiscal 2022, the Company now expects the following:UpdatedPreviousNet Sales$14.06 billion - $14.12 billion$13.95 billion - $14.05 billionComparable Store Sales+5.4% - +5.8%+5.2% - +5.8%Operating Margin Rate10.10% - 10.15%~10.2%Net Income$1.07 billion - $1.08 billion$1.065 billion - $1.085 billionEarnings per Diluted Share$9.55 - $9.63$9.48 - $9.60Capital expenditures for fiscal 2022 are currently forecasted to be in the range of $650 million to $700 million, including the opening of approximately 60 to 70 new Tractor Supply stores and 10 new Petsense by Tractor Supply stores. New store openings of Tractor Supply stores in 2022 have been delayed due to external conditions of the real estate and construction industries.Conference Call InformationTractor Supply Company will hold a conference call today, Thursday, October 20, 2022 at 10:00 a.m. ET, hosted by Hal Lawton, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Kurt Barton, Chief Financial Officer.

If you want to skip our introduction to the investment guru, and want to take a look at the top five stocks in this list, then head on over to 5 Warren Buffett Stocks That Are Too Cheap To Ignore. The bloodbath in the stock market this year that has shocked investors and rattled retail investors has seen major stock market indexes once again bleed big chunks of their value just as they had started to recover from the coronavirus pandemic. The NASDAQ Composite index is down a painful 35% year to date, the New York Stock Exchange has lost an equally painful 21% and the Dow Jones Index is now down 19%.During these times, it's hard to fathom putting more money in the market as the soaring U.S. dollar itself becomes a safe haven and cash funds become 'king.' However, for the astute investor, there might be opportunities to sift out which companies saw their fortunes turn simply due to the larger macroeconomic environment and not because of any fundamental weakness.Two ratios used by Wall Street to get a rough idea of whether a company is undervalued or overvalued are the price to earnings (P/E) and price to sales (P/S) ratios. These take a look at a firm's revenue or earnings and compare them with the share price to determine what is the 'premium' offered by the market over their ability to make money. The P/S ratio is used for firms that are yet to generate a profit, and the P/E ratio is for those that regularly churn out bottom line profits.The billionaire financial guru Warren Buffett is the most renowned name in the financial industry, and he is at the helm of the holding company Berkshire Hathaway. Berkshire's investment portfolio dwarfs all hedge funds out there, and by the end of this year's second quarter it was worth a staggering $300 billion - which is more than the central bank foreign exchange reserves of most of the world's countries, including the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States ($229 billion) and the Bank of England of the United Kingdom ($178 billion).Story continuesTherefore, it's safe to assume that Mr. Buffett is doing something right when it comes to investing, and over the course of his career, his firm has provided 20% average returns, which is more than double the Standard and Poor 500 index's return according to Forbes Magazine. The same magazine also has a net worth estimate for the investor and estimates that as of September 2022, Mr. Buffett was worth a staggering $95.5 billion. This estimate comes after he has donated more than $49 billion to a host of charitable organizations and causes.In today's piece, we will focus on which companies Mr. Buffett's firm has invested in that are undervalued based on traditional metrics. The top picks on this list are HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ), U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), and Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY).Our MethodologyWe sifted through Berkshire Hathaway's second quarter of 2022 portfolio to pick out which firms were trading at price to earnings and price to sales ratios that are lower than industry averages.10.

(Stone) today is seen as a payment provider with lower margins than its peers in a structurally difficult environment in Brazil: strong competition, declining take rates, increasing funding costs. The last two quarterly updates indicated improvement in all business lines for Stone and management did forecast further margin increases throughout all of 2022. In contrast to the other payment providers, Stone also has a sizable software business. In addition, Stone is working towards becoming a full-fledged financial services provider. Both endeavors add costs to the P&amp;L, but do not yet add meaningful profits, which is about to change. Particularly the lending business could become bigger and more profitable than the current bread-and-butter payments business. However, the lending business was suspended last year after experiencing issues that resemble those of the early PayPal from more than two decades ago (“X.com” was renamed “PayPal” in 2001)…” (Click here to see the full text)6.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Hot Stocks To Buy Right Now.One of Wall Street's Biggest Bull Slashes ForecastOn October 17 John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer, slashed his year-end price target for the S&amp;P 500 from 4,800 points to 4,000. Though this is down 17% from the bank's prior target, it still implies a 10% upside from current levels. John Stoltzfus noted that his projections for the end of 2022 factor in a ""massive rally short of a miracle"" based on the current uncertainty and volatility in the markets. Stoltzfus does not see the Fed pivoting by year-end, however, he sees the market in an ""extremely oversold"" condition"" which can ""become a catalyst for a modest rally"" as we approach the end of the year.Analyst Sees Stocks Rallying in the Short TermOn October 17 Morgan Stanley CIO, Mike Wilson, appeared on a call with CNBC where he pointed out that his ""intermediate-term view is more constructive"" and explained why he sees a rally in stocks in the short term. Mike Wilson said that he does not think it is a ""cost-push inflation"" situation, it is rather a ""demand-pull inflation"" situation and is ""very serious"". Here are some comments from Mike Wilson:""We think an earnings recession, and a technical recession at some point, will play through and that's not fully priced... We've had a bearish view all year, we think the 200-week moving average is a really important technical level that a lot of people don't talk about... The bear market is not over, but you can have major moves off of these technical support levels... We've been bearish all year and it's time for some relief...We overheated, the Fed reacted to that, financial conditions are tightening, and now we are gonna feel the effects of that on growth, mostly next year. the good news is the market has already discounted almost 100% of what the Fed's done at this point and I would say that they have discounted very little of the earnings impact that's going to be felt next year...We're not calling for rates to fall down, but maybe they will just stop going up, and that can be enough for equity markets to get excited...""Story continuesAs of October 17, the S&amp;P 500 has tanked 23% year to date, the Nasdaq is down 32% for the year, and the Dow has lost about 17% since the beginning of 2022.

402,aa099890-8178-309f-9b58-270f0fa54a6e,OXY,2022-10-20,Is Trending Stock Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY) a Buy Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-occidental-petroleum-corporation-130001903.html,1666184401,STORY,['OXY'],"[Occidental Petroleum (OXY) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this oil and gas exploration and production company have returned +5.4%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry, which Occidental falls in, has gained 4.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Occidental is expected to post earnings of $2.85 per share, indicating a change of +227.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -5.9% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $10.83 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +324.7%. This estimate has changed -1.8% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.79 indicates a change of -18.9% from what Occidental is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -4.9%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Occidental is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for OXY _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Occidental, the consensus sales estimate of $9.98 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +46.4%. The $39.03 billion and $36.24 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +48.3% and -7.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryOccidental reported revenues of $10.74 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +78.6%. EPS of $3.16 for the same period compares with $0.32 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.74 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +10.22%. The EPS surprise was +7.85%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Occidental is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Occidental. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

403,553bbfc3-3b1a-3b39-8cb4-f7ddf7582f98,BSX,2022-10-20,Boston Scientific (BSX) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boston-scientific-bsx-earnings-expected-140102266.html,1666188062,STORY,"['BSX', 'BSX-PA']","[The market expects Boston Scientific (BSX) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 26. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis medical device manufacturer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.44 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +7.3%.Revenues are expected to be $3.14 billion, up 7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.14% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Boston Scientific?For Boston Scientific, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.63%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Boston Scientific will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Boston Scientific would post earnings of $0.42 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.44, delivering a surprise of +4.76%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Boston Scientific appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

He expects that to increase as newer-generation farmers acquire knowledge of post-harvest processes to increase quality, such as fermentation, and apply that to family farms.(Reporting by Marcelo Teixeira; Editing by Josie Kao)]"

However, after investigating Textron (NYSE:TXT), we don't think it's current trends fit the mold of a multi-bagger.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Textron:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.088 = US$1.1b ÷ (US$16b - US$3.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2022).So, Textron has an ROCE of 8.8%.  On its own, that's a low figure but it's around the 8.3% average generated by the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry. View our latest analysis for Textron roceIn the above chart we have measured Textron's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Can We Tell From Textron's ROCE Trend?Things have been pretty stable at Textron, with its capital employed and returns on that capital staying somewhat the same for the last five years. This tells us the company isn't reinvesting in itself, so it's plausible that it's past the growth phase. So don't be surprised if Textron doesn't end up being a multi-bagger in a few years time.In Conclusion...In a nutshell, Textron has been trudging along with the same returns from the same amount of capital over the last five years. And investors may be recognizing these trends since the stock has only returned a total of 16% to shareholders over the last five years. As a result, if you're hunting for a multi-bagger, we think you'd have more luck elsewhere.Story continuesWhile Textron doesn't shine too bright in this respect, it's still worth seeing if the company is trading at attractive prices.

Our estimate of $3.68 earnings per share for the to-be-reported quarter indicates growth of 20.2% from the year-ago reported figure.Let’s see how things are shaping up for Norfolk Southern this earnings season.Q3 ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Norfolk Southern’s third-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $3.25 billion, indicating 13.89% growth year over year. Our estimate of $3.28 billion of revenues indicates growth of 15.1% from the year-ago reported figure. The top line is likely to have been aided by the strength across its all key segments — merchandise, intermodal and coal.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter Merchandise revenues is pegged at $1,903 million, indicating 11.3% growth from the year-ago reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter Intermodal revenues is pegged at $963 million, indicating 18.6% growth from the year-ago reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter Coal revenues is pegged at $394 million, indicating 19.4% growth from the year-ago reported figure.On the flip side, escalating operating expenses, primarily due to rising fuel prices, continue to bother NSC’s bottom line. Moreover, supply-chain disruptions and slower network velocity are expected to have weighed on volumes in the third quarter. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for NSC’s third-quarter 2022 earnings has been revised downward by 1.1% in the past 90 days to $3.66.What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Norfolk Southern this time around.

411,ad814ffe-016e-362e-83a6-660c7b10382e,NSC,2022-10-20,Norfolk Southern (NSC) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/norfolk-southern-nsc-earnings-expected-140102439.html,1666188062,STORY,['NSC'],"[The market expects Norfolk Southern (NSC) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 26. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis railroad is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.64 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +19%.Revenues are expected to be $3.22 billion, up 12.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.97% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Norfolk Southern?For Norfolk Southern, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.44%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Norfolk Southern will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Norfolk Southern would post earnings of $3.44 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.45, delivering a surprise of +0.29%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Norfolk Southern doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Investors are flocking to long-term investment strategies, with dividends gaining solid ground among them. Due to this, dividend stocks are outperforming other class assets this year. According to Matthew Bartolini, the head of SPDR Americas Research, the average return of 123 dividend strategies tracked in the firm's research was recorded at -8.4% as of August 2022. This was six percentage points above the return of the S&amp;P Global BMI Index. He further mentioned that dividend yields contributed significantly to such returns.The past performance of the stock market during bear markets shows that high-dividend stocks have outperformed their peers in nearly every market downturn. Moreover, reinvestment plans also make dividend stocks more reliable relative to other securities. Companies with strong dividend growth cycles allow shareholders with reinvestment plans to increase the value of their investments. According to Charles Schwab’s research, reinvesting dividends can significantly boost shareholders’ initial investment. Another report by the same financial services company shows that dividend securities surpassed the overall market in six out of seven bear markets from 1976 to 2022.

If you want to see some more high quality dividend stocks, go directly to 5 Dividend Stocks to Buy Amid the Market Decline.Like many other stocks in 2022, many dividend stocks have fallen substantially this year. The Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF, which seeks to track the performance of large cap equity stocks emphasizing stocks with a record of growing dividends year over year, has fallen 17.73% year to date as of 10/17.One reason for the decline is the five Federal Reserve rate hikes this year. With the rate hikes, risk free Treasuries are yielding more than before. While the 10 year Treasury yield was 1.512% at the end of last year, the yield is now 3.99% as of 10/17. As a result of higher Treasury yields, stocks with the same dividend yields as before the rate hikes are less attractive to many buyers.There is potential for more rate hikes in the future. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in September, “My main message has not changed since Jackson Hole. The FOMC is strongly resolved to bring inflation down to 2%, and we will keep at it until the job is done.” Currently core inflation is at 6.6%, which is a 40 year high.Given the rapid rate of the rate hikes, there is also a potential for a recession next year, which some economists estimate to be around a 60% probability. Other economists estimate an even higher probability for a recession.Given the interest rate and economic headwinds, many dividend stocks have fallen substantially. The S&amp;P 500 index has also fallen 23% year to date and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is comprised of larger cap stocks than the S&amp;P 500, is down around 17.5% year to date.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for investors to have a well diversified portfolio of stocks across different sectors. While there is potential for even more downside in the dividend sector if economic data fails to meet expectations, there could also be opportunities for long term investors who buy quality dividend stocks.Story continuesIn terms of some of the dividend stocks we think are worthy of consideration, here are 10:15 fastest growing dividend stocksCopyright: netsay / 123RF Stock PhotoMethodologyFor our list of 10 Dividend Stocks to Buy Amid the Market Decline, we picked 10 stocks with dividend yields of over 2% as of 10/17 that we think have the right mix of value and growth for long term investors. Using the collective wisdom of hedge funds, we then ranked the 10 based on the number of hedge fund holders that held shares in each stock at the end of Q2 2022.10 Dividend Stocks to Buy Amid the Market Decline10. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Dividend Yield as of 10/17: 3.16%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a high quality dividend stock given its dividend yield of 3.16% as of 10/17 as well as its 60 consecutive years of raising its annual dividend. Given the market decline, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) now trades at a forward P/E ratio of 21.75, which could be attractive in the long term given the company's high quality earnings.Aristotle Capital commented on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q2 2022 letter earlier in the year,“The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), the global beverage business, was a leading contributor for the period. Coca-Cola continues to benefit from the refranchising of its bottling operations and realignment of incentives, catalysts we previously identified. These initiatives are demonstrating their strength in an inflationary and supply-chain-challenged environment. Additionally, the company has focused on evolving its customer engagement practices by leveraging digital and social medias for targeted campaigns, such as the design and launch of Coke Byte in the metaverse. Lastly, Coca-Cola has furthered its transformation into a total beverage company, as it debuted its new Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey and Coca-Cola ready-to-drink premixed cocktail.

The company is going through a phase of unfavorable mix, commodity cost inflation, increase in freight costs, product and packaging investments and other impacts that hurt margins. It expects higher commodity and freight costs to persist in fiscal 2023.That said, what has helped the stock hold its ground in the ongoing market sell off is the stability and resilience of its business across all stages of the economic cycle.

In the trials (TRuE-V1 and TRuE-V2), application of ruxolitinib cream resulted in significant facial and total body repigmentation versus vehicle-control as shown by greater proportions of patients reaching the facial and total body Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (F-VASI and T-VASI, respectively) endpoints at Week 24 vs. vehicle, with a higher proportion of patients responding at Week 521.""Incyte is committed to developing innovative medicines for people with immune-mediated dermatologic conditions, and the publication of the TRuE-V results in NEJM is the culmination of years of work to advance science in vitiligo where there were no approved pharmacologic treatments for repigmentation,"" said Jim Lee, M.D., Ph.D., Group Vice President, Inflammation &amp; Autoimmunity, Incyte. ""These pivotal results demonstrate significant improvements in facial and total body repigmentation with ruxolitinib cream, and we are proud that these data served as the foundation for the recent approval of ruxolitinib cream as the first and only U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment for repigmentation in nonsegmental vitiligo.""Story continuesResults from the Phase 3 TRuE-V studies vehicle-controlled period (24 weeks) were previously announced, and Week 52 data were featured in an oral presentation at the late-breaking abstract session at the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) Annual 2022 Meeting. Key findings from the studies include:Results at Week 24, which were consistent across both studies, showed that approximately 30% of patients treated with ruxolitinib cream achieved ≥75% improvement from baseline in F-VASI (F-VASI75), the primary endpoint, while approximately 13% of patients applying vehicle in one study achieved the primary endpoint. At Week 52, approximately 50% of patients who received ruxolitinib cream from Day 1 achieved F-VASI75.Additionally, at Week 24, more than 15% of patients treated with ruxolitinib cream achieved ≥90% improvement from baseline in F-VASI (F-VASI90) vs. approximately 2% of patients applying vehicle met F-VASI90. At Week 52, the percentage of ruxolitinib cream-treated patients who achieved F-VASI90 doubled to approximately 30%.A greater proportion of patients at Week 52 achieved ≥50% improvement in T-VASI (T-VASI50), and further improvement on percentage change from baseline in facial body surface area (F-BSA) with application of ruxolitinib cream was also observed.In the vehicle-controlled period of the Phase 3 studies, the most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 1%) were application site acne, application site pruritus, nasopharyngitis, headache, urinary tract infection, application site erythema, and pyrexia2.""The primary and key secondary analyses from the TRuE-V program demonstrate the improvement in repigmentation possible with ruxolitinib cream,"" said David Rosmarin, M.D., Vice Chair of Research and Education, Department of Dermatology at Tufts Medical Center. ""As a physician, this is exciting. Vitiligo has historically been challenging to treat, and these data reinforce the potential that this new medical treatment can have for people who are interested in repigmentation.""Vitiligo is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by depigmentation of skin that results from the loss of pigment-producing cells known as melanocytes. Overactivity of the JAK signaling pathway is believed to drive inflammation involved in the pathogenesis and progression of vitiligo. In the United States, more than 1.5 million people are diagnosed with vitiligo3. The overall prevalence of the condition is estimated to be approximately 2-3 million4, with the majority of patients (approximately 85%) suffering from nonsegmental vitiligo5. Vitiligo can occur at any age, although many patients with vitiligo will experience initial onset before the age of 306.In July 2022, Opzelura (ruxolitinib) cream was approved by the FDA for the topical treatment of nonsegmental vitiligo in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Previously, in 2021, Opzelura was approved by the FDA for the topical short-term and non-continuous chronic treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis (AD) in non-immunocompromised patients 12 years of age and older whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies, or when those therapies are not advisable.The NEJM publication of the TRuE-V results is available online.About TRuE-VThe TRuE-V clinical trial program includes two Phase 3 studies, TRuE-V1 (NCT04052425) and TRuE-V2 (NCT04057573), evaluating the safety and efficacy of ruxolitinib cream in patients with vitiligo. Each study enrolled approximately 300 patients (age ≥12 years) who have been diagnosed with nonsegmental vitiligo.About Opzelura™ (ruxolitinib) Cream 1.5%Opzelura, a novel cream formulation of Incyte’s selective JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib approved by the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration for the topical treatment of nonsegmental vitiligo in patients 12 years of age and older, is the first and only treatment for repigmentation approved for use in the United States. Opzelura is also approved in the U.S. for the topical short-term and non-continuous chronic treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis (AD) in non-immunocompromised patients 12 years of age and older whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies, or when those therapies are not advisable. Use of Opzelura in combination with therapeutic biologics, other JAK inhibitors, or potent immunosuppressants, such as azathioprine or cyclosporine, is not recommended.The marketing authorization application (MAA) for ruxolitinib cream as a potential treatment for adolescents and adults (age &gt;12 years) with nonsegmental vitiligo with facial involvement is under review at the European Medicines Agency (EMA).Incyte has worldwide rights for the development and commercialization of ruxolitinib cream, marketed in the United States as Opzelura. In April 2022, Incyte entered into a strategic alliance agreement with Maruho Co., Ltd. for the development, manufacturing and exclusive commercialization of ruxolitinib cream for treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory dermatology indications in Japan.Opzelura is a trademark of Incyte.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONOPZELURA is for use on the skin only.

419,e91e66a0-62c1-3a7c-aa20-0a8f42bd4fa4,WM,2022-10-20,Waste Management (WM) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/waste-management-wm-earnings-expected-140102629.html,1666188062,STORY,['WM'],"[Waste Management (WM) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 26. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis garbage and recycling hauler is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.50 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +19.1%.Revenues are expected to be $5.04 billion, up 8.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.08% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Waste Management?For Waste Management, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.51%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Waste Management will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Waste Management would post earnings of $1.36 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.44, delivering a surprise of +5.88%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Waste Management doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

422,25db5fe4-e8e0-35cf-a50c-f6e5ddb0ed11,INTU,2022-10-20,Intuit QuickBooks Report Reveals Holiday Spending with Small Businesses Could Hit $88 Billion Despite Fragile Consumer Confidence,Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intuit-quickbooks-report-reveals-holiday-123000875.html,1666182600,STORY,['INTU'],"[US Consumers Set to Spend 40% of Total Holiday Budget at Small BusinessesMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., October 19, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Despite continued macroeconomic challenges facing consumers and small businesses, a new Intuit QuickBooks survey shows that consumers plan to spend 40% of their total holiday budget at small businesses, representing an $88 billion opportunity. These findings and more are highlighted in the QuickBooks Holiday Shopping Survey, based on a recent survey of 5,500 consumers and 1,500 businesses commissioned by Intuit (NASDAQ: INTU), the global financial technology platform that makes TurboTax, Credit Karma, QuickBooks, and Mailchimp.The report highlights consumer and small business plans for the upcoming holiday season, including an expected increase in consumer spending compared to last year, with small businesses a main beneficiary. This comes at a period when inflation is making consumers more price-sensitive. Small businesses are also predicting increased sales, with about 70% forecasting more revenue this holiday season compared to 2021. And about 80% of the small businesses surveyed say the 2022 holiday season is more important to their overall financial health than last year.""The holiday season is always the biggest time of the year for our business, but this year it is incredibly important for us to hit sales. Due to challenges in the marketplace such as higher supplier prices and supply chain issues, this holiday season is definitely a make or break for us,"" said Anthony and Courtney Bui, founders of The Long Dog Clothing Company in Torrance, California.Challenges Facing Small Businesses this Holiday SeasonGiven the economic climate, small businesses rank hiring and supply chain challenges as top factors that may impact holiday sales goals. According to the QuickBooks survey, 70% predict inventory or product shortfalls, and 90% are experiencing shipping and fulfillment woes.With more than half of consumers’ shopping budgets expected to be spent online and 70% of consumers shopping more online due to inflation concerns, small businesses need to have a strong omnichannel sales strategy. Consumers surveyed said quick-and-easy checkouts and online payments are the top features they desire from an online shopping experience. Consumers also say they will spend even more money at small businesses that offer holiday promotions and discounts, and fast, affordable shipping options.Story continues""To capture consumer spend, small businesses should embrace selling online across multiple sales channels, staying ahead of the game in procuring and effectively managing inventory, and delivering seamless shopping and shipping experiences,"" said Shilpa Reddy, vice president of QuickBooks Commerce.Additionally, consumers’ desire for experiences is increasing this holiday season. They want to do things they couldn’t during the pandemic, with 41% expecting to spend more on experiences this year because they finally feel safe to do so. This could be a boon for small businesses in the entertainment and dining industries, as well as service-based businesses overall.QuickBooks has created a special holiday hub to help small business owners with the tools and resources they need to thrive and grow. For more information, small businesses can visit https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/holidays.QuickBooks and Mailchimp Can Help Small Businesses SucceedThe QuickBooks platform helps small businesses better manage their finances and business operations year-round, with a suite of integrated tools ideal for holiday sales planning and management. Mailchimp, an email and marketing platform enables small businesses to find and engage customers across email, social media, landing pages, and advertising. With e-commerce projected to make up at least 50% of all consumer holiday shopping this year – up from 2021 levels – here are some tips for small businesses to optimize sales.Make shopping online easy with a simple, integrated checkout experience: More than seven out of 10 consumers want small businesses to make it easy for them to buy online this holiday season. Additionally, they say they’ll shop more with small businesses whose checkout experience is quick and easy. To improve customer checkout, small businesses can implement an integrated payments solution like QuickBooks Payments, accepting customers’ payments in every way they want to pay with online invoicing, mobile payment apps, and in-person card readers. Additionally, those customers who don't quite make it to checkout, businesses can use Mailchimp to set up Abandoned Cart Automations that remind shoppers to complete a purchase.Diversify revenue while keeping inventory up-to-date: It’s important for small businesses to not just sell online, but to sell across multiple channels. The QuickBooks data shows that consumers use third-party e-commerce sites and social media marketplaces as often as small businesses’ own websites. The importance of diversification of sales channels is also true for brick-and-mortar small businesses: up to one in two consumers say they are less likely to buy from a small business in-person if they can’t find them online. Once selling across multiple channels, small businesses can use QuickBooks Commerce Accounting to help track sales and inventory in one place. Keeping consumers updated on inventory will be especially crucial, as up to three-quarters of consumers are worried about product shortages this holiday season.Offer discounts where possible: Given consumer concerns about inflation, shoppers will be particularly price-conscious this holiday season. Where possible, small businesses should look to offer discounts. This can be a particularly effective strategy to drive in-person sales: the data shows in-store experiences and exclusive discounts will entice more people to a small business. Small businesses can leverage data insights from QuickBooks Online and QuickBooks Commerce Accounting to help identify the best products and sales channels to offer discounts. With Mailchimp, small businesses can turn their marketing data into personalized messaging to reach customers with the right discount at the right time.Remind consumers you’re local while spotlighting quality and service: The data shows consumers like to buy from small businesses because it supports their local economy. Further, more than 70% of consumers surveyed say they get the best service and quality from small businesses. For these reasons, when looking for unique holiday gifts, roughly two-thirds choose small businesses, such as local gift shops, over large businesses. Remind consumers of your local ties and commitment to high quality and service. One way small businesses can do this is through targeted marketing campaigns like those powered by Mailchimp.About IntuitIntuit is the global financial technology platform that powers prosperity for the people and communities we serve.

423,c1bffb33-26da-3cba-b05d-53109e5ee1f0,SYK,2022-10-20,Stryker Corporation's (NYSE:SYK) Has Had A Decent Run On The Stock market: Are Fundamentals In The Driver's Seat?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stryker-corporations-nyse-syk-had-110048389.html,1666263648,STORY,['SYK'],"[Most readers would already know that Stryker's (NYSE:SYK) stock increased by 8.2% over the past three months. Given that stock prices are usually aligned with a company's financial performance in the long-term, we decided to investigate if the company's decent financials had a hand to play in the recent price move. Specifically, we decided to study Stryker's  ROE in this article.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for Stryker How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Stryker is:13% = US$2.1b ÷ US$16b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.13 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.A Side By Side comparison of Stryker's Earnings Growth And 13% ROETo begin with, Stryker seems to have a respectable ROE. Even when compared to the industry average of 12% the company's ROE looks quite decent. Despite the moderate return on equity, Stryker has posted a net income growth of 2.2% over the past five years. So, there could be some other factors at play that could be impacting the company's growth. For instance, the company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is faced with competitive pressures.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Stryker's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 19% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is SYK fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Stryker Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Despite having a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 49% (implying that the company retains the remaining 51% of its income), Stryker's earnings growth was quite low. So there could be some other explanation in that regard. For instance, the company's business may be deteriorating.In addition, Stryker has been paying dividends over a period of at least ten years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 30% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected drop in the payout ratio explains the expected increase in the company's ROE to 21%, over the same period.ConclusionIn total, it does look like Stryker has some positive aspects to its business. Yet, the low earnings growth is a bit concerning, especially given that the company has a high rate of return and is reinvesting ma huge portion of its profits. By the looks of it, there could be some other factors, not necessarily in control of the business, that's preventing growth. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum.

But if you choose individual stocks with prowess, you can make superior returns. For example, the DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) share price is up 53% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 21% (not including dividends).The past week has proven to be lucrative for DaVita investors, so let's see if fundamentals drove the company's three-year performance. Check out our latest analysis for DaVita In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During three years of share price growth, DaVita achieved compound earnings per share growth of 41% per year. The average annual share price increase of 15% is actually lower than the EPS growth. So it seems investors have become more cautious about the company, over time. This cautious sentiment is reflected in its (fairly low) P/E ratio of 9.92.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..A Different PerspectiveWhile it's certainly disappointing to see that DaVita shares lost 21% throughout the year, that wasn't as bad as the market loss of 24%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 8%, each year, over five years. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with DaVita .Story continuesDaVita is not the only stock that insiders are buying.

Growth in commercial services and strength in spare parts sales are expected to reflect in segmental revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Aerospace revenues in the third quarter indicates a 21.6% jump from the year-ago reported number.The Healthcare segment is expected to have benefited from higher Imaging, Ultrasound and HTS services sales and strong order demand. The consensus mark for Healthcare revenues in the third quarter suggests a 6.4% rise from the year-ago reported number.However, low shipment volumes might have dented performance of the Power segment. Weak demand in the onshore wind unit and continued pressure from onshore North American market is expected to have weighed on the Renewable Energy segment’s revenues in the third quarter.Supply chain disruptions, including labor and material shortages and high logistics costs, are likely to have dampened GE’s third-quarter performance. Given the company’s substantial international exposure, foreign currency headwinds might have impeded its performance in the to-be-reported quarter.What Does the Zacks Model Say?Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for General Electric this time around.

433,9a6eea6b-97b3-34c4-9921-57397def483f,VLO,2022-10-20,Murphy USA (MUSA) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/murphy-usa-musa-earnings-expected-140102705.html,1666188062,STORY,"['MUSA', 'VLO']","[The market expects Murphy USA (MUSA) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 26. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis gasoline station operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of $7.82 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +96.5%.Revenues are expected to be $5.96 billion, up 29.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.15% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Murphy USA?For Murphy USA, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +12.68%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #1.So, this combination indicates that Murphy USA will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Murphy USA would post earnings of $5.35 per share when it actually produced earnings of $7.53, delivering a surprise of +40.75%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Murphy USA appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsValero Energy (VLO), another stock in the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $6.78 for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +455.7%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $41.79 billion, up 41.6% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Valero Energy has been revised 0.3% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, reflecting an equal Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Valero Energy will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

""UnitedHealthcare is committed to supporting local organizations through grants which address social determinants of health and foster improved health outcomes for the people of New Mexico.""The grant recipients include:New Mexico Doula Association — $50,000 to provide access to doula care for women and other pregnant people with financial need, promoting expanded maternal care in rural and frontier communities and a reduction in the maternal mortality rate.New Mexico Perinatal Collaborative — $40,000 to support and expand a statewide initiative with 27 birthing facilities. The initiative helps improve the health of and outcomes for pregnant families and their infants by promoting safe birthing best practices through a focus on quality improvement strategies and training for facilities, doctors, nurses, midwives and other perinatal care providers.National Latino Behavioral Health Association — $98,000 to launch trainings for behavioral health bilingual language interpreters, and two eight-week youth cohort groups focused on reducing risk factors in the onset of alcohol, tobacco and other drug use.""Resourcing New Mexico's communities by directly supporting prevention services and the state's behavioral health workforce are excellent strategies in building capacity of the behavioral health system in New Mexico,"" said Fredrick Sandoval, executive director, National Latino Behavioral Health Association. ""With the funding received from UnitedHealthcare, we are able to enhance current evidence-based prevention programs to help reduce the onset of substance use and other stressors among New Mexico youth.""Story continuesAccording to the New Mexico Human Services Department, New Mexico experiences a higher maternal mortality rate of 21.5 deaths per 100,000 live births compared to the national average of 17.4 deaths per 100,000 live births. Increased access to necessary maternal and doula care can help identify and solve for the most common challenges facing women and other pregnant people, infants and birthing families, including mental health conditions, cardiac conditions, embolism and hemorrhage.""The funding from UnitedHealthcare for New Mexico Perinatal Collaborative supports perinatal health care providers across New Mexico – particularly those in rural areas who have limited access to critical training and continuing education – by helping them improve outcomes for families in their local communities,"" said Jennifer Mastripolito, executive director, New Mexico Perinatal Collaborative.""Through this opportunity, we are able to mobilize a doula workforce which is an essential part of the birth team that improves both maternal health outcomes and helps families thrive,"" said Melissa Marie Lopez, executive director, New Mexico Doula Association.UnitedHealthcare’s commitment to addressing social determinants of health by supporting community-based initiatives is a continuing priority. In 2021, UnitedHealthcare provided $2.85 million to the March of Dimes to fund hospital quality improvement initiatives as part of a public-private partnership to address Black maternal health. Additionally, the company’s Empowering Health grants have invested $40 million to expand access to care through partnerships with local communities in 29 states since 2018.In New Mexico alone, UnitedHealthcare has provided several grants to local organizations including those addressing affordable housing, food insecurity and nutrition assistance in underserved communities, bringing the company’s investment in the state to more than $380,000.UnitedHealthcare serves more than 205,000 members enrolled in employer-sponsored, individual and Medicare and retirement plans in New Mexico, with a network of 41 hospitals, and over 11,000 physicians and other care providers statewide.

435,63a36b61-357d-3045-8c38-d32f977e6aa9,UNH,2022-10-20,Here is What to Know Beyond Why UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-unitedhealth-group-130001080.html,1666184401,STORY,['UNH'],"[UnitedHealth Group (UNH) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this largest U.S. health insurer have returned -0.1%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - HMOs industry, which UnitedHealth falls in, has gained 0.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.UnitedHealth is expected to post earnings of $5.30 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +18.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.9%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $21.93 points to a change of +15.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.5%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $24.81 indicates a change of +13.2% from what UnitedHealth is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.5%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for UnitedHealth.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For UnitedHealth, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $81.28 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +10.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $322.49 billion and $349.02 billion estimates indicate +12.1% and +8.2% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUnitedHealth reported revenues of $80.89 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.8%. EPS of $5.79 for the same period compares with $4.52 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $80.72 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.21%. The EPS surprise was +6.24%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.UnitedHealth is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about UnitedHealth. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

436,39baf781-817e-3bb4-ba52-4579f97ccadc,LKQ,2022-10-20,Is There An Opportunity With LKQ Corporation's (NASDAQ:LKQ) 35% Undervaluation?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/opportunity-lkq-corporations-nasdaq-lkq-161600100.html,1666196160,STORY,['LKQ'],"[How far off is LKQ Corporation (NASDAQ:LKQ) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for LKQ The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.08bUS$1.04bUS$1.13bUS$1.16bUS$1.19bUS$1.22bUS$1.25bUS$1.28bUS$1.30bUS$1.33bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x4Analyst x3Analyst x3Est @ 2.51%Est @ 2.35%Est @ 2.24%Est @ 2.16%Est @ 2.11%Est @ 2.07% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.0% US$1.0kUS$911US$921US$887US$849US$812US$776US$740US$706US$674(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$8.3bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.0%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.3b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.0%– 2.0%) = US$27bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$27b÷ ( 1 + 7.0%)10= US$14bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$22b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$51.4, the company appears quite undervalued at a 35% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at LKQ as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.080. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For LKQ, there are three important elements you should assess:Risks: Take risks, for example - LKQ has   3 warning signs  (and 1 which is a bit unpleasant)  we think you should know about.Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for LKQ's future outlook?

""But I was very fortunate to get my first job at Procter &amp; Gamble. I got to work with a lot of great people.

First, stabilize a business financially rocked by a E.Coli outbreaks. Second, relaunch the brand to concerned consumers.The now 48-year old executive has accomplished all of that and more, shepherding innovations from new menu items (at long last) such as cauliflower rice and quesadillas to testing robots out that make tortilla chips. Niccol has also supercharged Chipotle's store count to more than 3,000 locations and is taking aim at opening more drive-thru spots to better cater to customers.""One thing I did discover while I was at P&amp;G— I had the opportunity to work on Pringles— is I loved working in the space of food,"" Niccol said. ""And you know, it just resonated with me.

If you want to skip our introduction to the investment guru, and want to take a look at the top five stocks in this list, then head on over to 5 Warren Buffett Stocks That Are Too Cheap To Ignore. The bloodbath in the stock market this year that has shocked investors and rattled retail investors has seen major stock market indexes once again bleed big chunks of their value just as they had started to recover from the coronavirus pandemic. The NASDAQ Composite index is down a painful 35% year to date, the New York Stock Exchange has lost an equally painful 21% and the Dow Jones Index is now down 19%.During these times, it's hard to fathom putting more money in the market as the soaring U.S. dollar itself becomes a safe haven and cash funds become 'king.' However, for the astute investor, there might be opportunities to sift out which companies saw their fortunes turn simply due to the larger macroeconomic environment and not because of any fundamental weakness.Two ratios used by Wall Street to get a rough idea of whether a company is undervalued or overvalued are the price to earnings (P/E) and price to sales (P/S) ratios. These take a look at a firm's revenue or earnings and compare them with the share price to determine what is the 'premium' offered by the market over their ability to make money. The P/S ratio is used for firms that are yet to generate a profit, and the P/E ratio is for those that regularly churn out bottom line profits.The billionaire financial guru Warren Buffett is the most renowned name in the financial industry, and he is at the helm of the holding company Berkshire Hathaway. Berkshire's investment portfolio dwarfs all hedge funds out there, and by the end of this year's second quarter it was worth a staggering $300 billion - which is more than the central bank foreign exchange reserves of most of the world's countries, including the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States ($229 billion) and the Bank of England of the United Kingdom ($178 billion).Story continuesTherefore, it's safe to assume that Mr. Buffett is doing something right when it comes to investing, and over the course of his career, his firm has provided 20% average returns, which is more than double the Standard and Poor 500 index's return according to Forbes Magazine. The same magazine also has a net worth estimate for the investor and estimates that as of September 2022, Mr. Buffett was worth a staggering $95.5 billion. This estimate comes after he has donated more than $49 billion to a host of charitable organizations and causes.In today's piece, we will focus on which companies Mr. Buffett's firm has invested in that are undervalued based on traditional metrics. The top picks on this list are HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ), U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), and Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY).Our MethodologyWe sifted through Berkshire Hathaway's second quarter of 2022 portfolio to pick out which firms were trading at price to earnings and price to sales ratios that are lower than industry averages.10.

Each stock was up 1% in the quarter compared to the 16% price decline for the S&amp;P 500 and the positions were reduced as the valuations became somewhat less appealing, though still attractive enough to warrant inclusion.”7. StoneCo Ltd. (NASDAQ:STNE) Price to Sales Ratio as of October 17, 2022: 2.15 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30 Industry Average P/S: 3.07 StoneCo Ltd.

Here is what the fund said:StoneCo Ltd. (Stone) today is seen as a payment provider with lower margins than its peers in a structurally difficult environment in Brazil: strong competition, declining take rates, increasing funding costs. The last two quarterly updates indicated improvement in all business lines for Stone and management did forecast further margin increases throughout all of 2022. In contrast to the other payment providers, Stone also has a sizable software business. In addition, Stone is working towards becoming a full-fledged financial services provider. Both endeavors add costs to the P&amp;L, but do not yet add meaningful profits, which is about to change. Particularly the lending business could become bigger and more profitable than the current bread-and-butter payments business. However, the lending business was suspended last year after experiencing issues that resemble those of the early PayPal from more than two decades ago (“X.com” was renamed “PayPal” in 2001)…” (Click here to see the full text)6.

Caesars Rewards members will be able to use credits at Broadway shows, local hotels, restaurants, retail stores, comedy clubs, entertainment venues, and more, driving more tourists to area businesses and creating thousands of direct and indirect jobs in and around Times Square.In addition to major economic benefits to all Times Square stakeholders, SL Green and Caesars are proposing significant security and traffic improvements as part of their proposal, which would boost Mayor Adams and the NYPD's efforts in Times Square. These efforts will make visitors feel safer, improve mass transit, encourage pedestrian travel, and mitigate vehicle congestion in the area, pursuant to a proposed traffic plan to be included as part of the project.Caesars Palace Times Square will be designed to include a Broadway Theater for The Lion King.

We applaud the developer's commitment to make the neighborhood safer for arts workers and audience members alike.""""Carmine’s has been in business in Times Square for over 30 years, and the public-private investments that were made in the late 90s and early 2000s literally transformed Midtown,” said Jeffrey Bank, President and CEO of the Alicart Restaurant Group, which operates Carmine's and Virgil’s BBQ. “It is time for us to reinvest again - Times Square is the beating heart of New York, but everyone in Times Square is still hurting from the pandemic. The Caesars Palace proposal is the key to bringing tourists back, making Times Square safer, and is exactly the economic driver we need to not only recover but continue to grow and create more jobs.""""A successful bid will provide a much-needed boost to area theaters, hotels, restaurants, and businesses and commit to fund a wide range of neighborhood initiatives and improvements to make Times Square the safest, cleanest, and most pedestrian-friendly entertainment district in the world,"" said Michael Prohaska, Business Manager of Laborers’ Local 79. ""This would mean bringing thousands of good union jobs to Midtown and enabling innovative new training and apprenticeship programs — initiatives that will provide disadvantaged community members with pathways to sustainable employment.”“A trip to New York isn’t complete without a visit to Times Square – it’s the crossroads of the world,” said Geoff Ballotti, President and CEO Wyndham Hotels &amp; Resorts, which franchises 38 hotels in Manhattan and the Great State of New York. “A project of this scale and scope will help bring more tourists back to Times Square, fill hotel rooms not only here, but all across the City and create great jobs at the same time.”""We know how to bring crime rates down in Times Square because we’ve done it before. With better security infrastructure and 24/7 monitoring, we can anticipate and prevent crime – we just need the financial and political willpower to do so,” said former New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton. “SL Green and Caesars’ proposal for Times Square goes beyond routine, in-house security and would invest millions in a new public-private safety initiative. This investment will ensure Times Square is safe for years to come.”Caesars is the largest North American gaming operator with more than 50 casino properties across its portfolio, retail and/or mobile sports betting in 27 jurisdictions, and iGaming in five jurisdictions.

DISCLOSURESFunds from Operations (FFO)FFO is a widely recognized non-GAAP financial measure of REIT performance. The Company computes FFO in accordance with standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not compute FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, or that interpret the NAREIT definition differently than the Company does. The revised White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT in April 2002, and subsequently amended, defines FFO as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of properties, and real estate related impairment charges, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.The Company presents FFO because it considers it an important supplemental measure of the Company’s operating performance and believes that it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, particularly those that own and operate commercial office properties. The Company also uses FFO as one of several criteria to determine performance-based bonuses for members of its senior management. FFO is intended to exclude GAAP historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and related assets, which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time. Historically, however, real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions. Because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization unique to real estate, gains and losses from property dispositions, and real estate related impairment charges, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, and interest costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), as an indication of the Company’s financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of the Company’s liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the Company’s cash needs, including the Company's ability to make cash distributions.Funds Available for Distribution (FAD)FAD is a non-GAAP financial measure that is calculated as FFO plus non-real estate depreciation, allowance for straight line credit loss, adjustment for straight line operating lease rent, non-cash deferred compensation, and pro-rata adjustments for these items from the Company's unconsolidated JVs, less straight line rental income, free rent net of amortization, second cycle tenant improvement and leasing costs, and recurring capital expenditures.FAD is not intended to represent cash flow for the period and is not indicative of cash flow provided by operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP. FAD is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure with respect to liquidity because the Company believes it provides useful information regarding the Company’s ability to fund its dividends. Because all companies do not calculate FAD the same way, the presentation of FAD may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. FAD does not represent cash flow from operating, investing and finance activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), as an indication of the Company’s financial performance, as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), or as a measure of the Company’s liquidity.Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate (EBITDAre)EBITDAre is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company computes EBITDAre in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, which may not be comparable to EBITDAre reported by other REITs that do not compute EBITDAre in accordance with the NAREIT definition, or that interpret the NAREIT definition differently than the Company does. The White Paper on EBITDAre approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT in September 2017 defines EBITDAre as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP), plus interest expense, plus income tax expense, plus depreciation and amortization, plus (minus) losses and gains on the disposition of depreciated property, plus impairment write-downs of depreciated property and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, plus adjustments to reflect the entity's share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated joint ventures.The Company presents EBITDAre because the Company believes that EBITDAre, along with cash flow from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities, provides investors with an additional indicator of the Company’s ability to incur and service debt. EBITDAre should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), as an indication of the Company’s financial performance, as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), or as a measure of the Company’s liquidity.Net Operating Income (NOI) and Cash NOINOI is a non-GAAP financial measure that is calculated as operating income before transaction related costs, gains/losses on early extinguishment of debt, marketing general and administrative expenses and non-real estate revenue. Cash NOI is also a non-GAAP financial measure that is calculated by subtracting free rent (net of amortization), straight-line rent, and the amortization of acquired above and below-market leases from NOI, while adding operating lease straight-line adjustment and the allowance for straight-line tenant credit loss.The Company presents NOI and Cash NOI because the Company believes that these measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures and reconciliations, provide investors with meaningful information regarding the operating performance of properties. When operating performance is compared across multiple periods, the investor is provided with information not immediately apparent from net income that is determined in accordance with GAAP. NOI and Cash NOI provide information on trends in the revenue generated and expenses incurred in operating the Company's properties, unaffected by the cost of leverage, straight-line adjustments, depreciation, amortization, and other net income components. The Company uses these metrics internally as performance measures. None of these measures is an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) and same-store performance should not be considered an alternative to GAAP net income performance.Coverage RatiosThe Company presents fixed charge and debt service coverage ratios to provide a measure of the Company’s financial flexibility to service current debt amortization, interest expense and operating lease rent from current cash net operating income. These coverage ratios represent a common measure of the Company’s ability to service fixed cash payments; however, these ratios are not used as an alternative to cash flow from operating, financing and investing activities (determined in accordance with GAAP).SLG-EARNPRESS CONTACTslgreen@berlinrosen.com]"

In contrast individual stocks will provide a wide range of possible returns, and may fall short. For example, the UDR, Inc. (NYSE:UDR) share price fell 26% in the last year, slightly below the market decline of around 23%. However, the longer term returns haven't been so bad, with the stock down 20% in the last three years. The falls have accelerated recently, with the share price down 12% in the last three months. But this could be related to the weak market, which is down 6.5% in the same period.Although the past week has been more reassuring for shareholders, they're still in the red over the last year, so let's see if the underlying business has been responsible for the decline. View our latest analysis for UDR In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.The last year saw UDR's EPS really take off. While the business is unlikely to sustain such a high growth rate for long, it's great to see. As a result, we're surprised to see the weak share price. So it's worth taking a look at some other metrics.UDR managed to grow revenue over the last year, which is usually a real positive. Since we can't easily explain the share price movement based on these metrics, it might be worth considering how market sentiment has changed towards the stock.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthUDR is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecastsWhat About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, UDR's TSR for the last 1 year was -24%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveThe total return of 24% received by UDR shareholders over the last year isn't far from the market return of -23%. The silver lining is that longer term investors would have made a total return of 4% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data remains strong, and the share price is simply down on sentiment, then this could be an opportunity worth investigating. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 3 warning signs  with UDR (at least 1 which is a bit concerning)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.But note: UDR may not be the best stock to buy.

MET, Prudential Financial Inc. PRU, Reinsurance Group of America Inc. RGA, Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies Inc. MMC and Aflac Inc. AFL.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:5 Insurers Set to Outperform This Earnings SeasonPer the latest Earnings Preview, the Finance sector’s third-quarter 2022 earnings are expected to decline 8.5% while revenues are estimated to improve 3.2%. Earnings of Insurance, one of the Finance sector industries, are estimated to drop 7.3% while revenues are expected to increase 1.2%. Better pricing and exposure growth are likely to have driven premiums, which in turn are expected to have aided insurers’ revenues.With the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have identified five insurers namely, MetLife Inc., Prudential Financial Inc., Reinsurance Group of America Inc., Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies Inc. and Aflac Inc. which are poised to outshine the Zacks Consensus Estimate in third-quarter earnings. These stocks have the ideal combination of two ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy), #3 (Hold) — to surpass expectations. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Factors Likely to Impact Q3 ResultsThe third quarter of 2022 bore the brunt of Hurricane Ian. Swiss Re estimates claims stemming from Hurricane Ian claims in the range of $50 billion to $65 billion. The Progressive Corporation incurred $760 million of catastrophe losses due to Hurricane Ian in the third quarter of 2022 that weighed on its quarterly results. Arch Capital Group expects pre-tax net catastrophe losses of $530 million to $560 million across the property casualty insurance and reinsurance segments for the third quarter.Story continuesInsurers witnessed improved pricing in the third quarter of 2022. An active catastrophe environment accelerated the policy renewal rate and aided better pricing. These, coupled with reinsurance programs, favorable reserve development and solid capital level, are likely to have aided underwriting profitability.Insurers, being beneficiaries of an improving rate environment, are expected to come up with improved investment results. The third quarter itself saw two rate hikes.  A larger investment asset base and alternative investments in private equity, hedge funds, and real estate, among others, coupled with an improving rate environment, are expected to have aided net investment income, an important component of insurers’ top line.Life insurers have been redesigning products by moving away from guaranteed savings products toward protection products of unit-linked savings products. Also, life insurers continue to roll out investment products that provide bundled covers of guaranteed retirement income, life and healthcare to cater to customers preferring policies with “living” benefits more than those with death benefits. Increasing demand for protection products is likely to have driven sales.The insurance industry continues to invest in digitalization. Accelerated digitalization is likely to have saved costs and driven margin expansion.Banking on operational efficiency resulting in a solid capital position, insurers continue to engage in strategic mergers and acquisitions, build on a niche, expand globally, diversify their portfolio and deploy capital to make dividend hikes and pay special dividends. Share buybacks are expected to have provided an additional upside to the bottom line.Potential Q3 OutperformersMetLife is an insurance-based global financial services company providing protection and investment products to a range of individual and institutional customers.  Its focus on launching insurance products in different fields is likely to have aided premium growth. Cost control, improving efficiency and streamlining of business are likely to have added to the upside.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MetLife’s third-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.16, suggesting a decrease of 51.5% from the year-ago reported figure.

According to Pew Research, about 50% of U.S. adults 55 and older are out of the labor force due to retirement, in part because of the pandemic.1 Additionally, gig and contract work is on the rise. The most recent data shows a 33% increase in 1099-K form (indicating revenue collected outside of an employer/employee relationship) filing from 2020 to 2021.2 What's more, 16% of Americans say they've earned money from an online gig platform.3""Whether entering retirement or pursuing solopreneur, gig or contract work, there is a growing number of Americans earning a living outside of the traditional worksite; but what hasn't changed is their need for the type of financial security that Aflac products can help provide,"" said Aflac Senior Vice President of Distribution Expansion and Consumer Markets Jeramy Tipton. ""Because benefits are traditionally obtained through the employer, these trends leave a gap in accessibility to insurance coverage for many Americans, a gap that Aflac is helping close by introducing popular products with these individuals in mind.""The new Aflac Dental, Vision and Hearing product includes three plan tiers so individuals can select the coverage that best meets their needs.

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Extra Space Storage (EXR) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $2.21 a share 13 days away from its upcoming earnings release on November 1, 2022.Extra Space Storage's Earnings ESP sits at 1.31%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $2.21 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.18.EXR is just one of a large group of Finance stocks with a positive ESP figure. Aflac (AFL) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Slated to report earnings on October 31, 2022, Aflac holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $1.23 a share 12 days from its next quarterly update.Aflac's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 0.74% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.22.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, EXR and AFL could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Earnings of Insurance, one of the Finance sector industries, are estimated to drop 7.3% while revenues are expected to increase 1.2%. Better pricing and exposure growth are likely to have driven premiums, which in turn are expected to have aided insurers’ revenues.With the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have identified five insurers namely, MetLife Inc. MET, Prudential Financial Inc. PRU, Reinsurance Group of America Incorporated RGA, Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies Inc. MMC and Aflac Inc. AFL which are poised to outshine the Zacks Consensus Estimate in third-quarter earnings.

You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Factors Likely to Impact Q3 ResultsThe third quarter of 2022 bore the brunt of Hurricane Ian. Swiss Re estimates claims stemming from Hurricane Ian claims in the range of $50 billion to $65 billion. The Progressive Corporation incurred $760 million of catastrophe losses due to Hurricane Ian in the third quarter of 2022 that weighed on its quarterly results. Arch Capital Group expects pre-tax net catastrophe losses of $530 million to $560 million across the property casualty insurance and reinsurance segments for the third quarter.Insurers witnessed improved pricing in the third quarter of 2022. An active catastrophe environment accelerated the policy renewal rate and aided better pricing. These, coupled with reinsurance programs, favorable reserve development and solid capital level, are likely to have aided underwriting profitability.Insurers, being beneficiaries of an improving rate environment, are expected to come up with improved investment results. The third quarter itself saw two rate hikes.  A larger investment asset base and alternative investments in private equity, hedge funds, and real estate, among others, coupled with an improving rate environment, are expected to have aided net investment income, an important component of insurers’ top line.Life insurers have been redesigning products by moving away from guaranteed savings products toward protection products of unit-linked savings products. Also, life insurers continue to roll out investment products that provide bundled covers of guaranteed retirement income, life and healthcare to cater to customers preferring policies with “living” benefits more than those with death benefits. Increasing demand for protection products is likely to have driven sales.The insurance industry continues to invest in digitalization. Accelerated digitalization is likely to have saved costs and driven margin expansion.Banking on operational efficiency resulting in a solid capital position, insurers continue to engage in strategic mergers and acquisitions, build on a niche, expand globally, diversify their portfolio and deploy capital to make dividend hikes and pay special dividends. Share buybacks are expected to have provided an additional upside to the bottom line.Story continuesPotential Q3 OutperformersMetLife is an insurance-based global financial services company providing protection and investment products to a range of individual and institutional customers.  Its focus on launching insurance products in different fields is likely to have aided premium growth. Cost control, improving efficiency and streamlining of business are likely to have added to the upside.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MetLife’s third-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.16, suggesting a decrease of 51.5% from the year-ago reported figure.

464,fd70a6b3-4320-3943-a374-b0c05e27bf25,SHW,2022-10-20,There's Been No Shortage Of Growth Recently For Sherwin-Williams' (NYSE:SHW) Returns On Capital,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/theres-no-shortage-growth-recently-120401304.html,1666267441,STORY,['SHW'],"[If you're not sure where to start when looking for the next multi-bagger, there are a few key trends you should keep an eye out for. Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Sherwin-Williams' (NYSE:SHW) returns on capital, so let's have a look.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Sherwin-Williams:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.17 = US$2.5b ÷ (US$22b - US$7.2b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).Thus, Sherwin-Williams has an ROCE of 17%.  On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 12% generated by the Chemicals industry. View our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams roceIn the above chart we have measured Sherwin-Williams' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.How Are Returns Trending?Sherwin-Williams is showing promise given that its ROCE is trending up and to the right. More specifically, while the company has kept capital employed relatively flat over the last five years, the ROCE has climbed 51% in that same time. So our take on this is that the business has increased efficiencies to generate these higher returns, all the while not needing to make any additional investments. It's worth looking deeper into this though because while it's great that the business is more efficient, it might also mean that going forward the areas to invest internally for the organic growth are lacking.Story continuesFor the record though, there was a noticeable increase in the company's current liabilities over the period, so we would attribute some of the ROCE growth to that. Essentially the business now has suppliers or short-term creditors funding about 33% of its operations, which isn't ideal. It's worth keeping an eye on this because as the percentage of current liabilities to total assets increases, some aspects of risk also increase.What We Can Learn From Sherwin-Williams' ROCETo bring it all together, Sherwin-Williams has done well to increase the returns it's generating from its capital employed. Since the stock has returned a solid 65% to shareholders over the last five years, it's fair to say investors are beginning to recognize these changes. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Sherwin-Williams can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.One more thing to note, we've identified   1 warning sign  with Sherwin-Williams and understanding it should be part of your investment process.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

The company’s performance is expected to reflect strong domestic demand as well as pricing and cost-control initiatives.

Raw material availability associated with the pandemic is likely to have affected performance, especially in The Americas Group. Raw material pricing is likely to have been high in the September quarter. SHW is also likely to have been affected by higher labor and transportation costs.Sherwin-Williams is also expected to have been challenged by weaker DIY demand in North America in the third quarter. It is also likely to have witnessed softer demand in Europe due to the sluggish macroeconomic environment. Moreover, lack of meaningful recovery in China following the lifting of pandemic-led restrictions is also expected to have affected the company. The SherwinWilliams Company Price and EPS Surprise The SherwinWilliams Company Price and EPS SurpriseThe SherwinWilliams Company price-eps-surprise | The SherwinWilliams Company Quote Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies in the basic materials space you may want to consider, as our model shows these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Albemarle Corporation ALB, scheduled to release earnings on Nov 2, has an Earnings ESP of +8.13% and sports a Zacks Rank #1.

However, miners are battling rising costs and supply-chain constraints.Freeport said average unit net cash costs for the North America copper mines rose 40.6% to $2.56 per pound in the reported quarter, primarily due to increased costs for energy, labor, maintenance and supplies and lower molybdenum by-product credits.The company said net income attributable to common stock fell to $404 million, or 28 cents per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $1.4 billion, or 94 cents per share, last year.However, the miner's adjusted profit was 26 cents per share, 2 cents above Wall Street estimates, according to Refinitiv data.The company, which runs Indonesia's Grasberg, one of the world's largest copper mines, said its quarterly copper production rose 7% to 1.06 billion recoverable pounds.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. View our latest analysis for Freeport-McMoRan How Fast Is Freeport-McMoRan Growing Its Earnings Per Share?Over the last three years, Freeport-McMoRan has grown earnings per share (EPS) at as impressive rate from a relatively low point, resulting in a three year percentage growth rate that isn't particularly indicative of expected future performance. As a result, we'll zoom in on growth over the last year, instead. Outstandingly, Freeport-McMoRan's EPS shot from US$1.94 to US$3.40, over the last year. It's not often a company can achieve year-on-year growth of 75%. The best case scenario? That the business has hit a true inflection point.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. The good news is that Freeport-McMoRan is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 7.8 percentage points to 38%, over the last year. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this free report showing analyst forecasts for Freeport-McMoRan's future profits.Story continuesAre Freeport-McMoRan Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Insider interest in a company always sparks a bit of intrigue and many investors are on the lookout for companies where insiders are putting their money where their mouth is. Because often, the purchase of stock is a sign that the buyer views it as undervalued. Of course, we can never be sure what insiders are thinking, we can only judge their actions.The US$8.5k worth of shares that insiders sold during the last 12 months pales in comparison to the US$1.6m they spent on acquiring shares in the company. This adds to the interest in Freeport-McMoRan because it suggests that those who understand the company best, are optimistic. It is also worth noting that it was company insider Ryan Lance who made the biggest single purchase, worth US$988k, paying US$31.88 per share.Along with the insider buying, another encouraging sign for Freeport-McMoRan is that insiders, as a group, have a considerable shareholding. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$170m. We note that this amounts to 0.4% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Freeport-McMoRan but it's still worth mentioning. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.Is Freeport-McMoRan Worth Keeping An Eye On?Freeport-McMoRan's earnings per share growth have been climbing higher at an appreciable rate. Just as heartening; insiders both own and are buying more stock. These factors seem to indicate the company's potential and that it has reached an inflection point. We'd suggest Freeport-McMoRan belongs near the top of your watchlist. Still, you should learn about the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Freeport-McMoRan (including 1 which is a bit concerning).There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. So if you like the sound of Freeport-McMoRan, you'll probably love this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.Have feedback on this article?

475,0151b896-6356-31cb-94a2-16864cc01ebc,PEP,2022-10-20,10 Dividend Stocks to Buy Amid the Market Decline,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-dividend-stocks-buy-amid-130059215.html,1666184459,STORY,"['KO', 'PFE', 'PEP', 'PG', 'ABBV']","[In this article, we will take a look at 10 dividend stocks to buy amid the market decline. If you want to see some more high quality dividend stocks, go directly to 5 Dividend Stocks to Buy Amid the Market Decline.Like many other stocks in 2022, many dividend stocks have fallen substantially this year. The Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF, which seeks to track the performance of large cap equity stocks emphasizing stocks with a record of growing dividends year over year, has fallen 17.73% year to date as of 10/17.One reason for the decline is the five Federal Reserve rate hikes this year. With the rate hikes, risk free Treasuries are yielding more than before. While the 10 year Treasury yield was 1.512% at the end of last year, the yield is now 3.99% as of 10/17. As a result of higher Treasury yields, stocks with the same dividend yields as before the rate hikes are less attractive to many buyers.There is potential for more rate hikes in the future. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in September, “My main message has not changed since Jackson Hole. The FOMC is strongly resolved to bring inflation down to 2%, and we will keep at it until the job is done.” Currently core inflation is at 6.6%, which is a 40 year high.Given the rapid rate of the rate hikes, there is also a potential for a recession next year, which some economists estimate to be around a 60% probability. Other economists estimate an even higher probability for a recession.Given the interest rate and economic headwinds, many dividend stocks have fallen substantially. The S&amp;P 500 index has also fallen 23% year to date and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is comprised of larger cap stocks than the S&amp;P 500, is down around 17.5% year to date.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for investors to have a well diversified portfolio of stocks across different sectors. While there is potential for even more downside in the dividend sector if economic data fails to meet expectations, there could also be opportunities for long term investors who buy quality dividend stocks.Story continuesIn terms of some of the dividend stocks we think are worthy of consideration, here are 10:15 fastest growing dividend stocksCopyright: netsay / 123RF Stock PhotoMethodologyFor our list of 10 Dividend Stocks to Buy Amid the Market Decline, we picked 10 stocks with dividend yields of over 2% as of 10/17 that we think have the right mix of value and growth for long term investors. Using the collective wisdom of hedge funds, we then ranked the 10 based on the number of hedge fund holders that held shares in each stock at the end of Q2 2022.10 Dividend Stocks to Buy Amid the Market Decline10. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Dividend Yield as of 10/17: 3.16%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a high quality dividend stock given its dividend yield of 3.16% as of 10/17 as well as its 60 consecutive years of raising its annual dividend. Given the market decline, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) now trades at a forward P/E ratio of 21.75, which could be attractive in the long term given the company's high quality earnings.Aristotle Capital commented on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q2 2022 letter earlier in the year,“The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), the global beverage business, was a leading contributor for the period. Coca-Cola continues to benefit from the refranchising of its bottling operations and realignment of incentives, catalysts we previously identified. These initiatives are demonstrating their strength in an inflationary and supply-chain-challenged environment. Additionally, the company has focused on evolving its customer engagement practices by leveraging digital and social medias for targeted campaigns, such as the design and launch of Coke Byte in the metaverse. Lastly, Coca-Cola has furthered its transformation into a total beverage company, as it debuted its new Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey and Coca-Cola ready-to-drink premixed cocktail. Although uncertainties surrounding cost pressures, lockdowns and geopolitical conflicts remain, we believe Coca-Cola is uniquely positioned to successfully continue its transition toward a total beverage business.”Of the 895 hedge funds in our database, 60 owned shares of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) at the end of the second quarter.Alongside Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is also a quality dividend stock many hedge funds owned at the end of Q2 2022.9. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)Dividend Yield as of 10/17: 2.66%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 65PepsiCo, Inc.

(NASDAQ:PEP) also has a higher yield than the average consumer staples dividend yield of 1.89%. Unlike the broader market, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) hasn't really fallen much this year, with shares down 0.56% year to date.65 hedge funds we track owned shares of PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) at the end of the second quarter with Yacktman Asset Management holding over 4.25 million shares.8. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Dividend Yield as of 10/17: 3.67%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is one of the leading pharmaceutical giants in the world and also a leader when it comes to making Covid-19 vaccines. Given Covid-19 has mutated, Pfizer will need to keep innovating as well.Given its research and development skills, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) could likely also develop other vaccines and potential treatments for the world's ailments in the future that could potentially increase earnings. As a dividend payer, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) has increased its annual dividend for 11 straight years and has a dividend yield of 3.67% as of 10/17.70 hedge funds we track owned shares of Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) at the end of Q2 2022.7. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV)Dividend Yield as of 10/17: 3.91%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 71AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is a dividend aristocrat given that it has increased its annual dividend for 50 consecutive years. With a dividend yield of 3.91% as of 10/17, AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) also has a higher yield than some comparable companies in the pharmaceutical sector. On 10/13, Terence Flynn of Morgan Stanley named the stock his 'Catalyst Drive Idea' citing AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV)'s anti-TNF ADC Phase 2 data. Flynn kept his $185 price target and 'Overweight' rating.71 hedge funds in our database held shares of AbbVie Inc.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Union Pacific is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for UNP in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $3.09 per share for UNP, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.07 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for UNP, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.67% heading into earnings season.Union Pacific Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseUnion Pacific Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseUnion Pacific Corporation price-eps-surprise | Union Pacific Corporation QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Delta Air Lines, Inc. DAL, Alaska Air Group ALK, American Airlines AAL and Union Pacific Corp. UNP.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Transportation Stocks Q3 Earnings Roster: ALK, AAL and UNPThe Zacks Transportation sector is widely diversified in nature. It houses airlines, railroads, shipping and trucking companies to name a few.Only one S&amp;P 500 transportation company, namely Delta Air Lines, Inc. has reported third-quarter 2022 numbers so far. Delta’s revenues of $13,975 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14,157.2 million but increased more than 52% year over year on the back of high air-travel demand. The buoyant air-travel demand scenario is also evident from the total operating revenue increase of 11% from third-quarter 2019 (pre-coronavirus) levels.Despite headwinds like inflation-induced market volatility, supply-chain woes and high-fuel costs, which have dented the prospects of the Transportation sector, the sector players have been aided by some positives. Owing to the uptick in economic activities, freight demand has been strong despite minor hiccups. This supported growth of transportation players like railroad operators. Following the relaxation of COVID-related restrictions, people resumed their daily activities and air-travel demand rebounded very strongly. This was a major tailwind for the airline companies in the sector. Even though economies have reopened, consumers’ urge for online shopping remains. This continued strength in e-commerce demand also bodes well.The positivity surrounding the sector is evident from the latest Earnings Preview report, which indicates that stocks in the Transportation sector are expected to report year-over-year growth of 48.4% earnings and 20.6% revenues in third-quarter 2022.Story continuesGiven this encouraging backdrop, let’s discuss three Transportation sector stocks —Alaska Air Group, American Airlines and Union Pacific Corp., which are scheduled to release their third-quarter 2022 earnings reports on Oct 20.Our quantitative model suggests that the combination of the following two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — increases the odds of a positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Let’s delve deeper.Alaska Air’s results are likely to reflect a continued recovery in air-travel demand and an improvement in passenger revenues. Moreover, its top-line guidance is encouraging. ALK expects total revenues to increase 16-19% from the third quarter of 2019 actuals. The passenger load factor is expected to be in the range of 85-88%.However, high fuel costs are likely to remain an overhang on Alaska Air’s bottom line. The carrier expects its third-quarter economic fuel cost to be in the $3.79-$3.89 range. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for economic fuel cost per gallon is pegged at $3.81, indicating 85.8% growth year over year.Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Alaska Air this season as ALK has an Earnings ESP of -0.73% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present.Alaska Air Group, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Alaska Air Group, Inc. QuoteAmerican Airlines revenues are likely to have been aided by buoyant air-travel demand and an improvement in passenger revenues. Moreover, AAL’s bullish top-line guidance is also encouraging. Total revenues in the third quarter of 2022 are anticipated to be roughly 10-12%, higher than the level recorded in third-quarter 2019. Management expects TRASM to be 20-24% higher than third-quarter 2019 actuals.On the flip side, an increase in oil prices continues to remain an overhang on AAL’s bottom line. The fuel cost per gallon in third-quarter 2022 is expected in the $3.73-$3.78 band.Our proven model does not conclusively predict a beat for American Airlines this earnings season as AAL has an Earnings ESP of -1.79% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present. At the time, the third-quarter earnings preview article was issued, AAL had an Earnings ESP of -12.16% and a Zacks Rank #3.American Airlines Group Inc. price-eps-surprise | American Airlines Group Inc. QuoteStrong freight demand is expected to have boosted Union Pacific’s freight revenues in the third quarter. On the flip side, escalating operating expenses, primarily due to rising fuel prices, remain an overhang on Union Pacific’s bottom line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average fuel price per gallon consumed is pegged at $4.09, indicating growth of 72.5% from the year-ago reported figure.Despite high fuel price concerns, our proven model predicts an earnings beat for Union Pacific this earnings season as UNP has an Earnings ESP of +0.67% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present.Earlier, the third-quarter earnings preview article showed that Union Pacific was unlikely to beat on earnings this quarter. At that time, UNP had an Earnings ESP of -0.86% and a Zacks Rank #3.

Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on Cisco Systems'  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. View our latest analysis for Cisco Systems How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Cisco Systems is:30% = US$12b ÷ US$40b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.30.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Cisco Systems' Earnings Growth And 30% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Cisco Systems has an impressive ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 11% the company's ROE is quite impressive. Probably as a result of this, Cisco Systems was able to see a decent net income growth of 18% over the last five years.As a next step, we compared Cisco Systems' net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 17% in the same period.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is CSCO worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether CSCO is currently mispriced by the market.Is Cisco Systems Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?While Cisco Systems has a three-year median payout ratio of 54% (which means it retains 46% of profits), the company has still seen a fair bit of earnings growth in the past, meaning that its high payout ratio hasn't hampered its ability to grow.Additionally, Cisco Systems has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 41% over the next three years. Regardless, the ROE is not expected to change much for the company despite the lower expected payout ratio.SummaryIn total, we are pretty happy with Cisco Systems' performance. We are particularly impressed by the considerable earnings growth posted by the company, which was likely backed by its high ROE. While the company is paying out most of its earnings as dividends, it has been able to grow its earnings in spite of it, so that's probably a good sign. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

Various enterprises are investing heavily to rapidly digitize their organizations, reflecting the shift to IoT, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).The rapid shift to these high-bandwidth and low latency applications like AI or ML, virtual and augmented reality reflects the need for 800G capacity and to connect multiple data center buildings together at high data rates.Per Gartner, worldwide spending for cloud solutions is expected to reach $500 billion in 2022. This will create a new revenue source in the industry. Cisco is investing heavily to build its portfolio to support cloud data centers, which is expected to generate positive ROI and win market share against stiff competition.Cisco has launched its new 800G platforms, Nexus 9232E and Cisco 8111, powered by Silicon One G100 to support high-performance connectivity demands, such as bandwidth-intensive AI/ML clusters and for the seamless performance of multi-level data center fabrics operating both in public and private cloud.Cisco has also launched two new high-density industry-standard QSFP-DD800 form factor optical transceivers, which double port bandwidth and connect single-mode fiber links in the data center up to 2km.Cisco Systems, Inc. Price and ConsensusCisco Systems, Inc. Price and ConsensusCisco Systems, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Cisco Systems, Inc. QuoteCisco Launches Solutions to Drive Top LineCisco’s shares have been negatively impacted by global supply chain challenges. The supply chain constraints resulted in a severe shortage of certain components that hurt its ability to ship products to customers, hindering the top-line growth in the last reported quarter.Cisco’s top-line growth was also affected by the Russia-Ukraine war, which has put various business enterprises in the crosshairs of geopolitical tension. Rising inflation is also a major headwind.Story continuesDue to these reasons, Cisco has guided revenue growth for the first quarter of 2023 in the low single digits of 2% to 4% compared with the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $13.33 billion, suggesting growth of 3.33% from the year-ago period.Further, as it ventures into new markets, Cisco is experiencing stiff competition from the likes of Wipro Limited WIT in cloud securities solutions and Broadcom AVGO in the networking space.These reasons have contributed to the fall in Cisco’s share price. The stock has tumbled 34.1% in the year-to-date period compared with the Zacks Computer - Networking industry’s decline of 33.7%.Wipro recently expanded its collaboration with VMware to help customers move data to the cloud at a reduced cost and operate in a multi-cloud infrastructure.With the recent collaboration, Wipro FullStride cloud services will be able to provide its security services to customers for no additional cost and protect data while operating in a multi-cloud architecture. This is expected to help Wipro garner more customers amid rising competition.Broadcom is also building strategic partnerships with companies like Tencent to accelerate the adoption of high bandwidth co-packaged optics (CPO) network switches for supporting cloud infrastructure.Under this partnership, Broadcom will provide the 25.6-Tbps Humboldt CPO switch device that features its StrataXGS Tomahawk 4 switch chip, directly co-packaged with the four 3.2-Tbps Silicon Photonics Chiplets In Package (SCIP) optical engines.However, to deal with rising competition in cloud solutions and networking space, Cisco recently expanded its business partnership with General Dynamics Information Technology (GDIT), a business unit of General Dynamics GD.GD is helping Cisco to maintain its position as the largest player in the networking space. The two companies have collaborated to deliver Cisco Private 5G services to various government enterprises for IoT and edge use cases.To diversify its product offerings and beat the competition, CSCO recently launched products and solutions in its Routed Optical Networking solution business to aid customers in saving up to 45% in power and 70% in real estate space for equipment and reducing carbon emissions.The company, with its recent product launches, is trying to address what the global economy needs right now, which will drive the stock in the long run.Cisco currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
