New Survey Reveals What Americans Need To ‘Feel Wealthy’,GOBankingRates,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/higher-salary-less-stress-survey-164233560.html,1686847353,STORY,['SCHW'],"[Hispanolistic / Getty ImagesIf the last few years have taught us anything, it’s that the modern economy is turbulent and often challenging. However, a growing number of Americans feel that having just enough money to get by — and managing to live well with less stress — is the true meaning of “wealthy.”See: Mark Cuban Says This Is the No. 1 Thing To Do To Build WealthFind: How To Build Your Savings From ScratchAccording to Charles Schwab’s 2022 Modern Wealth Survey, the average American believes that being rich means having a net worth of $2.2 million. However, the survey finds that being “wealthy,” at least in the minds of those polled, has little to do with making a higher salary and building actual financial wealth.Among the 1,000 adults surveyed, 48% claimed they already feel wealthy. However, this group has an average net worth of $560,000, about a quarter of the $2.2M they think it takes to be rich. Schwab found that millennials are more likely to say they are wealthy, with 57% of those aged 26 to 41 feeling this way compared with only about 40% of Gen Z, Gen X and baby boomers. For millennials who say they feel wealthy, their average net worth is about $530,000, per CNBC.The sixth annual Schwab survey, conducted by Logica Research, examines how Americans think about saving, spending, investing and wealth. This year, the study found that more respondents value well-being (40%) over money (32%) or assets (26%) when asked what it means to be wealthy. Per Schwab: “And they did this not by choosing their favorite answer to a multiple-choice question, but in their own words. Well-being was more important than anything else.”Take Our Poll: Who Has Given You the Best Money Advice You Have Ever Received?Across the board, those surveyed tended to veer toward answer choices that gave priority to healthy relationships and having flexibility, freedom and less stress in their lives. Respondents overwhelmingly embraced value-driven “wealth” over material possessions and making more money by selecting things like enjoying experiences (70%) over owning nice things (30%), not having to stress over money (70%) over having more money than most people they knew (30%) and having a healthy work life balance (69%) over maximizing their earnings (31%).Story continuesAdditionally:67% felt that being generous with loved ones now was more important that leaving an inheritance (33%).Being in good health (63%) was favored to being successful (37%).62% of respondents believe that enjoying healthy relationships with loved ones, while 38% consider having a lot of money more meaningful.40% answered that having a higher salary meant being wealthy, but 60% said that having the flexibility of working where and how they want is how they define wealth.“Americans today aren’t as worried about keeping up with the Joneses, and more importantly, they understand that they can be happier with fulfilling experiences and relationships, even if they have less money than them,” said Jonathan Craig, managing director and head of investor services at Charles Schwab.As the Schwab survey shows, many Americans are changing the way they look at life, moving away from the “bigger, better” mentality and toward investing in an enjoyable stress-free life.“We’re seeing these trends at Schwab as well,” Craig added. “First, when people think about managing their finances and building wealth, it’s so much more personal than just money and investments. How they invest and what they invest in reflects their unique goals and passions.”More From GOBankingRatesIn Less Than a Decade, You Won't Be Able To Afford a Home in These CitiesPlanning To Buy a Home?Take_Our_Poll3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000Experts: 4 Safest Places To Keep Your InvestmentsThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Higher Salary or Less Stress?

Economic activity has continued to expand at a modest pace, with job gains being robust in recent months and the unemployment rate remaining low. The U.S. banking system is also deemed to be sound and resilient.The Fed’s decision to stand pat is set to provide a reprieve to consumers who have been hit with steady increases in rates for credit cards, adjustable-rate mortgages and other loans. Tighter credit conditions for households and businesses are expected to affect economic activity, hiring and inflation. As such, the rate hike pause allows the Fed to gather more data and assess the impact of previous rate hikes on the economy before making further adjustments (read: 5 Sector ETFs Soaring to New 52-Week High).However, future rate increases are still on the table, with the Fed signaling two more quarter percentage point moves before the year-end as inflation remains still above the Fed’s target range of 2%. According to the central bank’s projections, the Fed could raise interest rates as high as 5.6% by the end of 2023.Eighteen members of the Federal Open Market Committee indicated their expectations for rates in 2023. Four members saw one more rate increase this year and nine expect two. Two more members added a third hike, while one saw four more. Only two members signaled that they don’t see more hikes this year. Meanwhile, investors anticipate a 61.5% chance of the Federal Reserve hiking rates by a quarter point at its Jul 25-26 meeting, per the latest date from the CME FedWatch Tool.Amid a still-hawkish Federal Reserve scenario, dividend investing seems to be a viable strategy for several reasons:Income Generation: One of the primary benefits of dividend investing is the steady stream of income generated through dividend payouts. Even if the market is volatile due to uncertainties around the Fed's future actions, dividend-paying stocks can provide a consistent income stream. This can be particularly beneficial in a low-interest-rate environment where the yield on other income investments like bonds may be relatively low.Potential for Dividend Growth: Companies with a strong history of dividend growth may continue to increase their dividends over time, which can help offset the impact of rising interest rates. These are typically established, profitable companies that have the financial flexibility to increase dividends even during economic downturns. Their ability to grow dividends can be a sign of financial health, which might provide some level of protection in an uncertain market.Defensive Nature: Dividend-paying stocks are often found in sectors considered ""defensive,"" such as utilities, consumer staples, and healthcare. These sectors can hold up better during economic downturns as they produce essential goods and services that are in demand regardless of economic conditions. Therefore, they may provide some level of stability in a portfolio if there are concerns about potential economic impacts from future rate hikes (read: Investors Flocking to Defensive Strategies ETFs: Here's Why).Compounding Returns: Reinvesting dividends can significantly enhance the power of compounding and can lead to exponential growth over the long term.Hedge Against Inflation: Dividend-paying stocks can also serve as a hedge against inflation. As the Fed maintains a hawkish stance, one of the concerns is rising inflation. Companies that can pass on increased costs to customers can maintain or even increase their profitability during inflationary periods, which can support their ability to pay dividends.Story continuesETFs to BetWhile there are several funds available in the space, we have highlighted five ETFs that have a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), which promises outperformance amid the current market conditions.Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG)Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF is the largest and the most popular ETF in the dividend space, with AUM of $67.6 billion and an average daily volume of 865,000 shares.

6,c8985ae7-5c04-36c0-8e4b-4ae3c3f3e2ca,NUE,2023-06-16,Aluminum Consumption By Country: Top 15,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aluminum-consumption-country-top-15-161551910.html,1686845751,STORY,"['RIO', 'AA', 'NUE']","[In this in-depth article, we'll find out about the largest consumers of aluminum by country and the main sectors this metal is being used in. If you want brief knowledge on which countries use the most aluminum per capita, read Aluminum Consumption By Countryfor the top 5.Aluminum consumption per capita by country is highest in developed nations, where sectors like automobiles, construction, and aerospace are matured. The largest consumer of aluminum in the world is South Korea currently, with a per capita consumption of 42.76 kgs. Closely following South Korea is Germany, with a per capita aluminum consumption of 31 kgs. The ubiquity of aluminum makes it the second most consumed metal, next to steel. According to the World Bureau of Metal Statistics, the global consumption of aluminum has registered an exponential increase in multiple industries. Among these, the automotive sector takes the lead with advances in technology, such as electric and lightweight vehicles prompting a surge in demand for aluminum. Which Country Consumes the Most Aluminum?Although the per capita consumption of aluminum in China is 28 kilograms annually, the sheer volume of its population makes China the largest consumer of aluminum in the world by volume. China's population causes its total consumption to account for an overwhelming 57% of global aluminum usage. Such consumption is primarily driven by the expansive Chinese manufacturing sector and the country's rapidly growing automotive industry, which mirrors global trends in adopting aluminum for lightweight technologies. The per capita aluminum is also related to the average national income level of the country, as measured by GDP per capita. As per OECD data, countries with per capita GDP between $5,000 and $15,000 consume 5 to 10 kg of aluminum per capita. Conversely, nations whose per capita GDP is above $25,000 have per capita aluminum consumption between 15 and 35 kgs, i.e., South Korea and Germany. Story continuesIf you want to tap into this ever-growing market, read 11 Best Aluminum Stocks To Buy and shape your financial decisions accordingly. Who Is The Largest Supplier Of Aluminum In the World?The largest supplier of aluminum in the world is Canada, whose aluminum exports reached $8.31 billion in 2021. Other leading suppliers of aluminum are Russia ($7.42 billion), India ($7.31 billion), and UAE ($6.68 billion), owing to their limited per capita aluminum consumption and considerable aluminum production.For instance, India produced 4 million metric tons of aluminum in 2022, but because of limited domestic aluminum needs, the country's per capita aluminum consumption is estimated to be 2.5 kgs. Moreover, India's focus on recycling aluminum scrap in the past led to such commendable aluminum exports.Who Are The Biggest Users Of Aluminum?The automobile and construction industries are the most responsible for aluminum consumption by industry. They account for 26.5% and 25.3% of the global aluminum use, respectively. The automobile sector, especially in developed countries, exhibits high aluminum consumption owing to the metal's favorable properties like corrosion resistance and recyclability.Conversely, developing countries' main aluminum consumption is in the construction sector, mainly in structural components like beams, panels, window frames, and facades. Another major consumer is the electrical industry, which accounts for 14.5% of the global total. As a good conductor of electricity and heat, aluminum is used in electrical appliances and infrastructure, such as power lines and transformers. Likewise, the packaging and foil industries together consume approximately 15.75% of the world's aluminum consumption. Aluminum's resistance to moisture, light, and microorganisms enhances product preservation, thereby marking 7.7% of its overall use in packaging. Global Aluminum MarketThe global aluminum market is expected to be on an upward trajectory during the period from 2020 to 2027. In 2022, the market's total valuation stood at approximately $170 billion, but it is projected to escalate to $277.5 billion by 2031 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 6.1%, according to Precedence Research.Aluminum's market-standing is unshaken because of its use in two primary sectors: automobile and packaging. For instance, in the packaging sector, aluminum has found a niche due to its barrier properties that preserve product quality and facilitate transportation convenience. The rapid expansion of the food &amp; beverage industry, coupled with a growing consumer preference for durable and recyclable packaging, has made aluminum a widely used metal. The largest aluminum company by market cap is Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO) mining company. With a market cap of $116 billion, Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO) has divided its mining operations into three sectors: bauxite, alumina, and primary metal. Moreover, the leading units of Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO) operate in Brazil, Australia, and Africa. Alcoa Corp (NYSE:AA) is another leading aluminum company with a market cap of $8 billion and operates in 10 countries. Alcoa Corp (NYSE:AA) produces and fabricates aluminum. The mining genius Alcoa Corp (NYSE:AA) also has R&amp;D centers in the US to make the metal's future more sustainable and lucrative.When we discuss recycling efforts in the aluminum sector, Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE), a Charlotte-based aluminum company, takes the lead. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) is committed to making aluminum mining and refining more sustainable. As a result, most of Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) efforts are in the sector of making aluminum more recyclable and safer for all sectors that it's used in. Aluminum Consumption By Country: Top 15Our Methodology To rank our list of aluminum consumption by country, we gathered the data from several sources like The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Aluminium Association, and International Aluminium, among others.While some countries had data on the year 2021, 2022, several countries had dated data from the year 2006 but we found that economic growth and population increase or decrease thereof, did not have a significant effect on consumption rates over 16 years except in decimal places. Therefore, we divided each country's annual aluminum consumption with its current population to find estimated aluminum consumption per capita by country for the year 2022.Based on our research and calculations, here is aluminum consumption by country:15. Norway Per Capita Aluminum Consumption: 5 kgs According to recent estimates, Norway's per capita aluminum consumption is 5 kilograms, mainly used in the country's automobile industry. Stats suggest that the majority of this consumption is met by domestic production, which is 1.4 million metric tons, thanks to Norway's abundant hydropower resources. Norway is also Europe's third-largest aluminum market, and its projects like Sunndal and Ardal take the lead in making the country independent in its aluminum consumption. 14. Australia Per Capita Aluminum Consumption: 10 kgs Owing to its 1.5 million metric tons of aluminum consumption, it's no surprise that Australia is among the leading aluminum consumers. Recent data estimates Australia's per capita aluminum consumption at approximately 10 kgs. Once again, the majority of this is domestically sourced, showcasing Australia's robust aluminum industry. This figure aligns with the fact that Australia is the world's largest producer of bauxite (it mined 100 million metric tons of bauxite in 2022), the primary ore used in aluminum production. 13. Turkey Per Capita Aluminum Consumption: 12.3 kgs Turkey's per capita aluminum consumption is estimated to be 12.3 kilograms. Predominantly, this consumption is satisfied through imports due to Turkey's limited domestic bauxite reserves. It's said that imported raw and semi-processed aluminum forms the bulk of Turkey's aluminum material flow. Moreover, the noteworthy countries Turkey imports aluminum from are Russia, India, Malaysia, and Iran. 12. Sweden Per Capita Aluminum Consumption: 13 kgs Although not a leading aluminum producer, Sweden surely is amongst the main consumers in this market. Sweden's per capita consumption of aluminum is estimated to be 13 kilograms, most of which is imported due to the country's limited domestic production capabilities. The import reliance is influenced by the scarcity of bauxite, and reports say that Sweden's aluminum imports are projected to reach $2.1 billion by 2026.11. Japan Per Capita Aluminum Consumption: 13 kgsJapan's per capita aluminum consumption has reached an estimated 13 kilograms annually. Japan, the world's third-largest economy, relies on aluminum imports to satisfy this demand due to domestic production constraints. The country's aluminum imports reached a whopping figure of $10.57 billion in 2022, owing to its advanced automotive industry's material requirements. 10. Canada Per Capita Aluminum Consumption: 13 kgsCanada exhibits a generous per capita aluminum consumption, estimated at 13 kilograms annually. This volume is mainly sourced from local production, thanks to the country's 3 million metric ton aluminum smelter production in 2022. Also, Canada houses North America's biggest aluminum smelter with a refining capacity of 0.629 million metric tons, which meets a major chunk of its aluminum demand. 9. Spain Per Capita Aluminum Consumption: 14 kgsSpain's per capita consumption of aluminum is currently 14 kilograms. This aluminum is primarily imported from three countries, namely Bahrain, Iceland, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). These countries are strategic choices due to their high output capacities, stability, and competitive pricing.8. France Per Capita Aluminum Consumption: 14.92 kgsOwing to its growing and in-demand automobile sector, France's per capita aluminum consumption stands at 14.92 kilograms. However, like many other top aluminum consumers, France's limited domestic production of bauxite means it also depends on imports to meet demand. France's aluminum imports in 2022 reached $9.82 billion from India and Germany, among others.7. USAPer Capita Aluminum Consumption: 15 kgs The United States showed a per capita aluminum consumption rate of 14.92 kilograms. This figure reflects a complex interplay of consumption patterns like industrial applications and recycling initiatives. Although a portion of this aluminum demand is met domestically, the US still has to import a major chunk of aluminum from Canada and China.6. Greece Per Capita Aluminum Consumption: 26.6 kgs The per capita consumption of aluminum is approximately 26.6 kgs in Greece. To meet this substantial demand, the country largely relies on international imports of raw and processed aluminum since it doesn't mine aluminum. Greence's aluminum imports are forecasted to reach $1.3 billion by 2026 (its main aluminum partners are Mexico and India). Click to continue reading and see Aluminum Consumption By Country: Top 5.Suggested Articles:15 Biggest Aluminum Companies in the World15 Largest Aluminum Producing Countries In The WorldTitanium Reserves by Country and 10 Biggest Mines in the WorldDisclosure: None.

During the quarter ending on March 31, 2023, the Fund's Institutional Shares exhibited a notable increase of 14.49%. This remarkable performance can be attributed to the resilience and robust demand witnessed by companies held within the Fund's portfolio. Spare some time to check the fund’s top 5 holdings to know more about their top bets for 2023.In its Q1 2023 investor letter, Baron Focused Growth Fund mentioned Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc. (NYSE:ARE) and explained its insights for the company. Founded in 1994, Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc. (NYSE:ARE) is a Pasadena, California-based real estate investment trust company with a $20.8 billion market capitalization. Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc. (NYSE:ARE) delivered a -17.42% return since the beginning of the year, while its 12-month returns are down by -7.84%. The stock closed at $121.92 per share on June 14, 2023.Here is what Baron Focused Growth Fund has to say about Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc. (NYSE:ARE) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:""Alexandria, an office REIT for the life sciences industry, declined 14.0% and hurt performance by 27 bps in the first quarter. The decline was due to concerns about bank failures and worries that regional banks were key lenders to many biotechnology companies that could fail if they did not get financing. However, Alexandria has minimal exposure to the biotechnology industry and has no exposure to regional banking troubles. We believe Alexandria is a truly special company with high barriers to entry, numerous other competitive advantages, and an attractive runway for growth. The company has long-term leases of 7 to 10 years. The lease terms escalate every year. Alexandria has an irreplaceable developable land portfolio that has lower development risk since it is tenant driven. The company continues to grow its earnings organically at a high single-digit rate and has development spending of another $3 billion that is already 80% pre-leased. Alexandria’s balance sheet is strong – 95% of its debt is fixed rate, and there are no debt maturities for the next two years. Business conditions remain favorable, with continued life science rent growth and institutional appetite for Alexandria’s assets at multiples above the company’s current valuation. Sales are taking place at over 20 times net operating income, while Alexandria today trades at just 15 times. The stock is trading today at an almost 50% discount to replacement cost. Assets trade today at $1,500 per square foot, while Alexandria is valued in the public market today at just $800 per square foot.""Story continuesPhoto by Owen Lystrup on UnsplashOur calculations show that Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc.

10,ed33cad8-26e2-31a2-9b06-02bbe19bc0ac,STT,2023-06-16,State Street (NYSE:STT) shareholders have endured a 13% loss from investing in the stock five years ago,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/state-street-nyse-stt-shareholders-125108661.html,1686833468,STORY,['STT'],"[In order to justify the effort of selecting individual stocks, it's worth striving to beat the returns from a market index fund. But even the best stock picker will only win with some selections. So we wouldn't blame long term State Street Corporation (NYSE:STT) shareholders for doubting their decision to hold, with the stock down 25% over a half decade. In contrast, the stock price has popped 9.8% in the last thirty days. However, this may be a matter of broader market optimism, since stocks are up 6.8% in the same time.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. View our latest analysis for State Street To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During the unfortunate half decade during which the share price slipped, State Street actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 6.1% per year. So it doesn't seem like EPS is a great guide to understanding how the market is valuing the stock. Alternatively, growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.Because of the sharp contrast between the EPS growth rate and the share price growth, we're inclined to look to other metrics to understand the changing market sentiment around the stock.Revenue is actually up 0.5% over the time period. A more detailed examination of the revenue and earnings may or may not explain why the share price languishes; there could be an opportunity.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-and-revenue-growthState Street is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. You can see what analysts are predicting for State Street in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.Story continuesWhat About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, State Street's TSR for the last 5 years was -13%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that State Street shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 22% over one year. That's including the dividend. That certainly beats the loss of about 3% per year over the last half decade. The long term loss makes us cautious, but the short term TSR gain certainly hints at a brighter future. Most investors take the time to check the data on insider transactions.

The company being a consumer defensive stock has been surviving the market turmoil pretty well. The discount retailer’s key strengths are strategic investments, a customer-centric approach, merchandise initiatives, and an emphasis on membership growth.These factors have been helping it register decent sales and earnings numbers. The Zacks analyst expects the company to register a 6% adjusted earnings per share improvement in fiscal 2023 on 6.2% revenue growth. This outlook reflects Costco’s ability to navigate the challenging operating environment, generate solid sales, and register high membership renewal rates.A favorable product mix, steady store traffic, pricing power and strong liquidity position should help Costco keep outperforming.

Chris Versace, Chief Investment Officer at Tematica Research, tells Yahoo Finance Live that consumers are being more selective with their spending, and, as a result, investors need to be more selective about the companies they choose to invest in.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: --and take it to what's going on with retail because it seems inflation has not fully stopped consumers from spending. Purchases at retail stores and restaurants unexpectedly rising in May up 3/10% last month to about $686 billion. That's according to Census Bureau data. Chris Versace is still with us, Tematica Research chief investment officer.And I guess this kind of shows what we're talking about, the demand is still there. One thing that really stuck out to me that is just bizarre to me in this report, you exclude motor vehicles and gas stations, right? You get a 4/10% increase. You know where the biggest increase came from of all the categories?CHRIS VERSACE: I'm going to guess food services.JULIE HYMAN: It's not what you would guess, right? Food service was up 4/10 of 1%. Building materials, garden equipment, and supplies, up 2.2%. Like what the what? I don't know what--CHRIS VERSACE: Oh yeah.JULIE HYMAN: I don't really understand where that came from.CHRIS VERSACE: I think some of that is seasonal in nature.JULIE HYMAN: I guess so.CHRIS VERSACE: And if people are concerned about the housing market with the tight supply, what are you going to do? You're going to do some repair or remodel. But when you compare that against what Home Depot had to say. Look, where I live, did people go crazy doing projects around the house coming out of the pandemic? Yes. So I wasn't surprised with what Home Depot had to say because you can only do so much. You can only go so far. But that number is very surprising.But I will say, though, that when I look at the retail sales numbers, I don't necessarily look at month-over-month. I always look year-over-year. Because when we think about how companies report, the earnings comparisons we look at, more often than not, it's year-over-year. And there, the headline was up 1.6% year-over-year. So when we talk about our inflation conversation--Story continuesJULIE HYMAN: And that category fell year-over-year, I should mention.CHRIS VERSACE: Yeah. Yeah. And when we talk about retail sales versus inflation, wow, people are paying more for less, right? And then you strip out everything else and you look at the pure retail number, only up 0.7% year-over-year. So again, people are paying more, getting less.AKIKO FUJITA: So it is about the higher prices. But the thing, also, it feels like there is still kind of this divide between where sentiment is versus where the spending is actually happening.CHRIS VERSACE: More selective, yeah.AKIKO FUJITA: How do we look at that divide?CHRIS VERSACE: You know, as an investor, you really got to pick your spots, right? So like when we pore over the data like department store sales, down 3 and 1/2% year-over-year. So we know that people may not be either shopping there or that they may not be buying clothing. And that kind of fits with the narrative that we've had, that people are eating out, people are traveling. You look at the TSA data, people are traveling going gangbusters. United just came out recently and kind of attested to that.And you look at food service, up 8% year-over-year, still strong. So people are choosing and being selective where they spend. But then you flip it around, when you have a company like Kroger that comes out and said, oh, we're seeing a lot of our higher end shoppers going towards store brands. Again, more signs of being selective.AKIKO FUJITA: It's about trade-downs in the everyday purchases, but not necessarily in the big purchases.CHRIS VERSACE: Buying what I want and saving where I can.JULIE HYMAN: So take that, then put this together between the Fed discussion and the retail sales discussion, and tell us what it means for my money, you know, and what people should be buying right now.CHRIS VERSACE: So kind of the way we look at it, most consumers, like you were saying, are being more selective. Where are they going to shop so they can stretch their dollars? That's going to be your Kroger's, your Walmart's, your Costcos. And I've liked Costco for quite some time, in part, because it has a very differentiated business model. It's membership-driven.And they derive, unlike Walmart or some other retailers out there, a disproportionate amount of their income from membership revenue. And they're continuing to grow their warehouse footprint. That means, oh, more members, more membership income. So that's one that I absolutely like.AKIKO FUJITA: Any other names in here? You know, it feels like it has been consistently about the value play. If we're talking about those everyday items, Costco is one we heard that from. The other big name retailers like a Walmart as well as a Target, I mean, how do you feel about some of those names in light of elevated prices?CHRIS VERSACE: So Walmart, absolutely. I mean, one of the things that stands apart with Walmart is it's actually the largest grocery chain in the US. So people are coming in more frequently. So they can kind of lean into that, the Walmart. In terms of taking advantage of their everyday low pricing, Target I think has a tougher chance.To me, Target's kind of like lost in the middle a little bit. Because you've got your dollar stores, right and you've got your Costcos, BJ's, and the like. And then Target kind of over here. So it's not-- I think they're going to have a tougher time.JULIE HYMAN: I want to ask about another area of the market. Not retail, but sort of related to these bigger themes we're talking about, and that's technology because that is the area that has done so consistently well, the large cap technology. If we're looking at a Fed that may be raising once, maybe twice again by year-end in the face of this strong consumer spending among other factors, what does that imply for tech stocks?CHRIS VERSACE: So I think we've got to step back a second. And I'm sure you guys have talked about this, but it bears repeating. When you look at how the technology market has exploded this year, really outperforming for the NASDAQ, it's only a handful of stocks that are really doing it, right?And it's really driven by AI-related headlines. So whether it's Microsoft, Google, to some extent Apple, Amazon, or Nvidia, of course, all AI. And every day, we continue to hear more news about AI. Even this morning, Google announcing some AI tool that allows people to virtually try on clothing.Kind of interesting, but just the notion that we're continuing to see more of this. But I think your point is well taken about higher rates, because technology stocks, typically, they're categorized, particularly small, medium-sized ones, borrowing. So their incremental cost goes higher to do that. So the question has become, OK, now what am I going to pay for this valuation?But at the same time too, just skirting back to the consumer, we've, what? A trillion dollars in credit card debt with rates according to the New York Fed that are the APR rates that are the highest they've ever seen since '94? And they're going to go higher? That's another headwind for the consumer too.AKIKO FUJITA: Are you buying into the AI boom?CHRIS VERSACE: Indirectly. So in the actual Alerts Plus portfolio that I manage for the street, we have a position in Marvell. So the way that we kind of think about it-- Marvell is a digital infrastructure play-- if we think about AI, mixed reality, augmented reality, and all these other things that are driving this virtuous circle of content creation consumption, AI is just another factor that's going to drive network capacity higher, fostering upgrades to the network.]"

23,04cb2ab4-9ba5-30e6-9cc0-6ab86d503600,XYL,2023-06-16,Xylem (XYL) Upgraded to Buy: Here's Why,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xylem-xyl-upgraded-buy-heres-160006386.html,1686844806,STORY,['XYL'],"[Investors might want to bet on Xylem (XYL), as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.A company's changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating. The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years.Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Xylem basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.For Xylem, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for XylemFor the fiscal year ending December 2023, this water and wastewater treatment company is expected to earn $3.35 per share, which is a change of 17.5% from the year-ago reported number.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Xylem. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 4.6%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Xylem to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

For a deeper dive into how we make our Pro Picks, read more here.PNC FinancialPNC Financial (NYSE:PNC), which was caught in the larger regional-bank pullback earlier this year, rocks a solid InvestingPro health score of 3.02 thanks in large part to a stalwart bottom line: The bank has a strong track record of free cash flow exceeding net income, indicating excellent earnings quality, and its revenue trend is better than virtually all its peers.On top of all that, it has been aggressively buying back shares and its dividend - which it has paid out for 52 years in a row - offers investors an enticing yield of 4.7%.After the hit it took earlier this year, Citi upgraded the stock to Buy and called its management team “one of the best” among large regional banks, citing the bank’s “clean asset quality” and “strong deposit base.” The bank has staged a partial recovery since then, but shares are still down nearly 20% year to date and InvestingPro’s fair value calculations still put upside at 28% from current levels.Goldman SachsGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), of course, needs no introduction. The investment bank has a superb 2.92 InvestingPro financial health score, supported in particular by brawny earnings, a free cash flow yield that beats out nearly all its peers, and a wonderful operating cash flow margin. It also has outstanding price momentum behind it: The stock’s four-year total price return is close to 95%.This is also a solid dividend stock, with a 3% payout and 11 straight years of dividend hikes. UBS and CFRA both recently stamped the stock with buy ratings, and analysts overall give shares plenty of upside - while InvestingPro fair value puts upside over 50% above current levels. Shares have ticked a little under 2% for the year.Story continuesHuntington BancsharesHuntington Bancshares (NASDAQ:HBAN) is another highly rated bank whose shares fell off a cliff earlier this year along with many other regional banks. But it also has a fantastic InvestingPro financial health score, at 3.12, that’s powered by relentlessly rising earnings per share, high average return on invested capital growth over the past two years, and a free cash flow yield of 20% that flattens the vast majority of peers.Most notably, the bank pays an incredible 5.8% dividend and has maintained its payout every year for more than a half-century. Huntington shares, which are down more than 20% for the year, are still quite cheap at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 7.5x - and InvestingPro’s fair value calculations say the stock could rocket over 20% from here.Hartford FinancialJoining its regional-bank brethren is Hartford Financial (NYSE:HIG), which also took a hit earlier this year. The bank’s free cash flow outpaces net income, meaning high earnings quality - and, in that vein, its ratio of cash flow to total debt is in the 97th percentile for the space while its liquid assets comfortably surpass its short-term obligations. Its revenue numbers overtake those of nearly all of its peers, as well, and has an impressive three-year total return on its stock price. And it is keen on returning cash to shareholders: It has been actively buying back shares and pays out a nice 2.4% dividend that it has increased for the past decade running. InvestingPro’s fair value estimate suggests staggering 38% upside, as affirmed by a recent upgrade to buy at Goldman Sachs. Shares have dipped just over 5% for the year.Data as of June 15, 2023.Related Articles3106595Procter &amp; Gamble earns second upgrade this week, JPMorgan raises on EPS upsideUBS upgrades First Solar to Buy on 2023 credit boost]"

27,625cb918-5db3-340d-95a9-030a68967dfa,O,2023-06-16,Investors in Gulf Keystone Petroleum (LON:GKP) have unfortunately lost 40% over the last year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-gulf-keystone-petroleum-lon-112954245.html,1686914994,STORY,"['GKP.L', 'CL=F', 'GUKYF']","[Investors can approximate the average market return by buying an index fund. Active investors aim to buy stocks that vastly outperform the market - but in the process, they risk under-performance. For example, the Gulf Keystone Petroleum Limited ( LON:GKP ) share price is down 51% in the last year. That's well below the market return of 7.7%. On the bright side, the stock is actually up 40% in the last three years. Furthermore, it's down 22% in about a quarter. We do note than an ongoing dispute between the Turkish and Iraqi governments has lead to a shutdown of the company's Kurdish production lines, which is weighing heavy on the share price.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.  View our latest analysis for Gulf Keystone Petroleum  While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Even though the Gulf Keystone Petroleum share price is down over the year, its EPS actually improved. It could be that the market is giving too much weight to these Kurdish production cuts.It's fair to say that the share price does not seem to be reflecting the EPS growth. So it's easy to justify a look at some other metrics.We don't see any weakness in the Gulf Keystone Petroleum's dividend so the steady payout can't really explain the share price drop. From what we can see, revenue is pretty flat, so that doesn't really explain the share price drop. Unless, of course, the market was expecting a revenue uptick.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthIt is of course excellent to see how Gulf Keystone Petroleum has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. Take a more thorough look at Gulf Keystone Petroleum's financial health with this free report on its balance sheet .What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Gulf Keystone Petroleum the TSR over the last 1 year was -40%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveInvestors in Gulf Keystone Petroleum had a tough year, with a total loss of 40% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 7.7%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 4% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Gulf Keystone Petroleum better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted   3 warning signs for Gulf Keystone Petroleum  you should be aware of, and 1 of them is a bit concerning.But note: Gulf Keystone Petroleum may not be the best stock to buy .

This suggests that Beijing is determined to prop up the economy and thus more stimulus is likely to boost activity in the world’s largest importer of crude.Adding to the week’s optimism has been weakness in the US Dollar Index, which fell overnight to a five-week low versus a basket of other currencies on the back of some disappointing U.S. economic data.The dollar is on track for its biggest weekly drop since January, making oil, which is denominated in dollars, cheaper for holders of other currencies.That said, the crude market is still down over 10% since the start of the year, despite swinging cuts to output levels from a group of top producers, given persistent concerns over the global demand outlook, and with the strength of the U.S. economy, in particular.The U.S. Federal Reserve paused its year-long rate-hiking cycle on Wednesday, as widely expected, but signaled the likelihood of two more rate increases this year.This has raised fears that the U.S. economy, the largest consumer of oil in the world, will fall into recession in the second half of the year.Story continuesAdditionally, the European Central Bank raised interest rates for the eighth successive time on Thursday and signaled further policy tightening ahead, while the Bank of England is likely to hike next week as it battles the highest level of inflation in the G7.Higher interest rates ultimately increase borrowing costs for consumers, which could slow economic growth and reduce oil demand.Numbers from Baker Hughes detailing the total of active oil rigs in the U.S. and positioning data from CFTC round off the week later in the session.Related ArticlesCrude oil stabilizes; set to record a positive weekOil treads water as markets weigh China optimism, Fed uncertaintyGold muted on mixed Fed cues, copper boosted by China rate cuts]"

C expects a year-over-year decline in its trading and investment banking (IB) revenues in second-quarter 2023. At an industry conference, Mark Mason, the chief financial officer of Citigroup, said that trading revenues and IB revenues had been down 20% and 25%, respectively, so far this quarter.A year ago, the company’s trading desk benefited from heightening volatility owing to interest rate hikes and the Ukraine war. However, the Congressional debate over the debt ceiling affected client activities in the ongoing quarter, dampening spurred market activity levels.Also, with a more challenging economic environment and gloomy dealmaking volume, the company’s IB revenues have declined so far this quarter. Nonetheless, management sees some ""green shoots"" in debt capital markets activity.A slowdown in business activities has compelled the bank to reduce headcounts and expenses. The company will reduce its headcount by 5,000 across the firm, primarily in the banking, markets and functions divisions.Mark Mason said the firm’s recent job cuts will cause expenses to climb as much as $400 million this quarter compared with the first three months of the year. Mason expects the bank's expenses in the second quarter of 2023 will be in the range of $300-$400 million higher sequentially, primarily attributed to severance costs tied to the leaving of 1,600 employees.Last month, Citigroup announced its plans to pursue an initial public offering of Banamex in Mexico.

The idea is to strengthen the regional transmission system and improve service reliability for about 35,000 consumers in the area.The project is a part of the multi-year effort Energizing the Future, which aims to modernize FirstEnergy's transmission system using cutting-edge machinery and technology. These will strengthen the power grid and reduce the frequency and duration of customer outages.FirstEnergy has committed more than $10 billion to the Energizing the Future program through 2022.Need for UpgradesA rise in temperature not only increases the demand for electricity but also poses a threat to electric infrastructure. The upgrades and maintenance at regular intervals are crucial in maintaining service reliability and ensuring customer satisfaction.The 69-kilovolt transmission line traverses Springfield Township and Moorefield Township for a distance of slightly more than 11 miles to the northeast, with sections of the line running alongside Interstate 68. ATSI replaced 105 wood poles over a six-mile stretch of the line and installed five new steel poles on foundations.

39,8974cf61-f722-3962-9e62-51f943aa1c4f,FE,2023-06-16,"With 77% institutional ownership, FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE:FE) is a favorite amongst the big guns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/77-institutional-ownership-firstenergy-corp-125242671.html,1686833562,STORY,['FE'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies FirstEnergy's stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsA total of 9 investors have a majority stake in the company with 51% ownership Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a businessA look at the shareholders of FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE:FE) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 77% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of FirstEnergy. View our latest analysis for FirstEnergy ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About FirstEnergy?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that FirstEnergy does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see FirstEnergy's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in FirstEnergy. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 12% of shares outstanding. The second and third largest shareholders are State Street Global Advisors, Inc. and BlackRock, Inc., with an equal amount of shares to their name at 7.5%.Story continuesOn further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 9 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of FirstEnergyThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of FirstEnergy Corp.. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$24m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 13% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over FirstEnergy. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Private Equity OwnershipWith a stake of 5.0%, private equity firms could influence the FirstEnergy board. Sometimes we see private equity stick around for the long term, but generally speaking they have a shorter investment horizon and -- as the name suggests -- don't invest in public companies much. After some time they may look to sell and redeploy capital elsewhere.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified   3 warning signs for FirstEnergy (2 are significant)  that you should be aware of.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

This makes the graphic processing unit (GPU) maker the fifth publicly traded U.S. company following Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon, which have a valuation of more than trillion dollars as of Jun 14.NVIDIA has been on a remarkable run since the beginning of 2023, with its share prices soaring 196% year to date (YTD) on hopes that the company will be a prime beneficiary of growing investments in generative artificial intelligence (AI).What’s Driving the Stock Higher?Though AI has been around for years, the meteoric rise of OpenAI’s ChatGPT has captivated the world’s attention on the power of generative AI to augment human capability, suggesting that the AI boom may just get started.Generative AI is a type of AI technology that can produce various types of content, including text, imagery, audio and synthetic data. It is driven by a large language model, which means it uses a lot of data to understand and generate conversations.NVIDIA Corporation PriceNVIDIA Corporation PriceNVIDIA Corporation price | NVIDIA Corporation QuoteThe growing demand to modernize the workflow across industries is expected to drive the demand for generative AI applications. The global generative AI market size is anticipated to reach $109.37 billion by 2030, according to a new report by Grand View Research. The market is expected to expand at a CAGR of 35.6% from 2023 to 2030.The adoption of ChatGPT among enterprises has already proven generative AI technology’s usefulness across multiple industries, including marketing, advertising, customer service, education, content creation, healthcare, automotive, energy &amp; utilities and video game development.The proven success of generative AI has sparked competition among software makers, including Salesforce CRM, Cisco CSCO and Adobe ADBE, to integrate the technology into their products. However, generative AI requires vast knowledge to create content and needs huge computational power. As a result, enterprises looking to create generative AI-based applications will require to upgrade their existing network infrastructure.Story continuesNVIDIA’s next-generation chips with high computing power can be the top choice for enterprises. The company’s CEO, Jensen Huang, already stated during the first-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings conference call that existing data centers are insufficiently equipped to handle growing AI workloads.NVIDIA’s GPUs are already being applied in AI models, which is expanding its footprint in untapped markets like automotive, healthcare and manufacturing. The generative AI revolution is likely to create huge demand for its next-generation high computing powerful chips. NVIDIA expects its second-quarter fiscal 2024 revenues to reach $11 billion from $6.7 billion in the year-ago quarter, largely driven by surging AI investments across the data center end market.Software Giants Integrating AI ToolsSalesforce forayed into the generative AI space with the launch of Einstein GPT in March 2023. Earlier this week, the company elevated the set of its generative AI tools with the launch of the AI Cloud service. With this, the company claims to offer one-stop AI-powered solutions for enterprises looking to enhance productivity.Salesforce’s newly launched AI Cloud is a suite of services that delivers enterprise-ready real-time, open and secure generative experiences across all applications and workflows. The suite will power new capabilities across Salesforce’s products, including Einstein service, data analysis software Tableau and workplace-messaging app, Slack.Cisco’s AI and machine learning offerings encompass a wide range of computing solutions for enterprises, including a focus on cybersecurity. The company plans to enhance customer experience solutions, devices and its video conferencing platform, Webex Suite, with ML technologies, automation and generative AI features from meeting summaries to visual enhancements.The digital media solutions provider, Adobe, aggressively expanded its footprint in the generative AI space through partnerships and new solutions. Adobe has unveiled a family of generative AI models, Firefly, focused on the generation of texts and images. Per the company, Firefly will offer more precision, speed, power and ease in content creation. It will let users of various experience levels create high-quality images and stunning text effects.At present, NVIDIA sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Adobe has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

To skip our detailed analysis of the journalism industry, click 5 Biggest Journalism Companies in the US.The mass media industry has remained a crucial part of the global economy for centuries. Whether you are interested in the financial markets, politics, or entertainment, it is likely that much of your opinion on any of these subjects will be heavily influenced by the media you consume. In this manner, journalism is an essential tool in the arsenal of those who prioritize controlling public opinion. And while many are heralding the age of modern technology and the internet as the end of an era for traditional media, it would be premature to write off the companies that have survived in this space for so long.Adapting to a New EnvironmentWith the rise of the internet, companies in many industries began to see their operations being impacted. Those operating within the journalism sector were no different, considering they found themselves often outmaneuvered by social media platforms offering news and information in real-time to a global audience at lower costs. However, media companies have been fighting back. According to a PwC outlook report on the global entertainment and media industry between 2022 and 2026, while total global entertainment and media revenue fell by 2.3% in 2020, it also rose by 10.4% the very next year. Based on this growth, it was estimated that the industry would grow by 7.3% between 2022 and 2026, rising at a compound annual growth rate of 4.6%.This growth has been heavily attributed to the adaptation of media and journalism companies to the digital environment. With the COVID-19 pandemic in particular, most readers and audiences developed a greater interest in digital content, making this a new and largely untapped market for many traditional media companies. Identifying and exploiting this market is what is allowing many of these companies to retain their position in the economy. For example, according to an article published by the Reuters Institute this January, more publishers today are willing to pour resources into podcasts and digital audio, which have been useful in increasing brand loyalty for many news brands. Media and journalism companies are also beginning to integrate artificial intelligence into their products to offer personalized experiences to their audiences. Additionally, while print media seems to be going out of fashion, a trend expected through 2023 is that of traditional news media companies taking their print publications online to make them more accessible for their readers.Story continuesWhile the rapidly shifting environment is continuing to change the way most media companies operate, many other mass media and journalism companies, such as Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) are continuing to flourish with their original business models. In the fiscal second quarter of 2023, for instance, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) generated revenues of $21.8 billion, beating estimates by a small amount. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) also beat analyst estimates by $376.2 million in the fiscal first quarter, with its revenue of $29.7 billion. The performance of companies such as these is evidence of the resilience of the US media and journalism companies, whether because they are highly profitable behemoths in their industry or because they are especially adept at conforming to changing conditions and trends. In light of this resilience, we have compiled a list of the largest US journalism companies in the market today.Biggest Journalism Companies in the USPhoto by Roman Kraft on UnsplashLet's now take a look at the 15 biggest journalism companies in the US. Our MethodologyEach of the journalism companies listed below is thus a major contributor to the US mass media and journalism industry since they either operate major news channels, TV networks, and newspapers or aid their distribution among the American populace.

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. However, after investigating Align Technology (NASDAQ:ALGN), we don't think it's current trends fit the mold of a multi-bagger.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Align Technology, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.15 = US$592m ÷ (US$5.9b - US$2.0b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).So, Align Technology has an ROCE of 15%.  On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 9.1% generated by the Medical Equipment industry. Check out our latest analysis for Align Technology roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Align Technology compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.So How Is Align Technology's ROCE Trending?In terms of Align Technology's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. Over the last five years, returns on capital have decreased to 15% from 31% five years ago. On the other hand, the company has been employing more capital without a corresponding improvement in sales in the last year, which could suggest these investments are longer term plays. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.Story continuesOur Take On Align Technology's ROCEIn summary, Align Technology is reinvesting funds back into the business for growth but unfortunately it looks like sales haven't increased much just yet. Additionally, the stock's total return to shareholders over the last five years has been flat, which isn't too surprising. All in all, the inherent trends aren't typical of multi-baggers, so if that's what you're after, we think you might have more luck elsewhere.If you'd like to know about the risks facing Align Technology, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should be aware of.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

The industry has witnessed growth in revenues, income and cash flow over the past few years, enabling most players to pursue acquisitions and other investments, and pay out stable dividends.Rising Dependency on Technologies: Most of the industry participants are also considering emerging technologies such as cloud computing to drive competitive advantage, increase innovation, improve speed to market and drive performance within the industry. The wider application of artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to be the biggest change induced by the pandemic. The adoption of AI should lower complications and simplify operations. This should aid the industry.Story continuesNotably, industry players are in the process of modernizing their traditional legacy-oriented business processes in order to keep themselves flexible in any kind of operating environment.Growing Security Issues and Remedies: Increased dependency on technology has led to growing cases of hacking, identity theft and malicious payload deliveries. With work-from-home models being the new-normal professional scenario, remote infrastructure vulnerabilities and security gaps are being exploited to secure unauthorized access to proprietary systems and data.As a preventive measure to enhance data security and ensure cyber-resilience, secure access technologies such as VPNs, two-factor authentication and other ID and access-management controls for home workers, as well as increased monitoring and threat-detection tools, are being used. Outsourced service providers are also updating organizational policies (including Bring Your Own Device and work-from-home policies) and data breach protocols in order to reduce security risks. Adequate training of employees about emerging threats and data security issues is also being prioritized by several companies.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Encouraging ProspectsThe Zacks Outsourcing industry, which is housed within the broader Zacks Business Services sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #84.

You can skip the detailed analysis of the tea industry and simply head to the 5 Countries With The Highest Tea Consumption Per Capita.Tea has long been a beloved beverage worldwide, but some countries have elevated its consumption to an art form. These nations have cultivated a deep-rooted tea-drinking culture, where sipping on a warm cup of tea has become an integral part of daily life. From elegant tea ceremonies to casual gatherings over a steaming pot, these countries embrace tea as more than just a beverage — a way of life. The global tea market was valued at $207.1 billion in 2020, with China being the most tea-producing country and consumer of tea as well on an overall basis. India and Sri Lanka also rank among the top tea-producing countries, with global tea consumption continuing to rise yearly. The three biggest tea-drinking countries Turkey, Ireland, and the United Kingdom also contribute largely to the global tea economy. Market Analysis: Understanding the Global Tea Consumption Landscape As a business owner, staying updated with the latest market trends and consumption patterns is essential. Understanding the global tea consumption landscape can provide valuable insights into consumer preferences and help you make informed business decisions. Recent market research suggests that the tea market is projected to expand by $19.48 billion between 2021 and 2026, with a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.55%. This growth is attributed to factors such as heightened consumer health awareness, a growing demand for specialty tea blends, and the increasing social appeal of tea as a beverage.Regarding regional consumption patterns, Asia-Pacific is the largest tea market, accounting for over 60% of global consumption. Europe and North America are also significant markets for tea consumption, with increasing demand for premium and specialty tea varieties. Turkey, the largest consumer of tea in the world, on per capita basis, consumes an average of 1,300 per person every year. Story continuesAs the demand for organic and sustainable tea products continues to rise, businesses have a significant opportunity to tap into this growing market trend. According to recent financial statistics, the global market for organic tea stood at $821 million in 2019 and is projected to reach $1,918.7 million by 2027, with a compound annual growth rate of 11.2%, as noted by Fortune Business Insights.With consumers becoming more aware of the environmental and social impact of their purchases, offering such products is not only beneficial for the planet but also profitable for businesses. When it comes to the tea industry, there are a few key players that dominate the market.One of the biggest players is Twinings, a British company that has been around since the 1700s. They offer a wide range of teas, from traditional black teas to more exotic blends like chai and green tea with jasmine.Another major player is Lipton, a brand that was initially owned by Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL). Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) sold Lipton to CVC Capital Partners in 2021. Lipton is known for its high-quality teas and innovative tea products, such as their ready-to-drink iced teas and their pyramid-shaped tea bags. Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) owns many popular tea brands including PG Tips, Tazo, and Brooke Bond, among others.Teavana, owned by Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), is also another famous tea brand headquartered in Atlanta, GA. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)'s Teavana had an annual revenue of $168.1 million in 2022 and the company currently employs 475 people. By understanding the global tea consumption landscape and keeping up with changing consumer preferences, businesses can stay ahead of the competition and cater to the evolving needs of their customers.Trade and Export: Examining the Business Implications of High Tea Consumption The surge in the popularity of high tea consumption has unlocked significant business prospects for trade and export industries. China, which stands among the 12 countries that produce the best tea in the world, has solidified its position as the dominant global tea exporter, with tea shipments valued at approximately $2.2 billion in 2021. Sri Lanka and Kenya also emerged as notable players in the tea export market during that year. It's worth noting that several countries heavily rely on tea imports from China. Vietnam and Morocco are among the key importers, with Hong Kong serving as the top destination, recording an export value surpassing $500 million in 2019. Furthermore, in 2020, Pakistan led the pack in tea imports, with a trade value approaching $590 million, followed by the United Kingdom and the United States. These statistics highlight the global appeal and demand for tea, creating a diverse and vibrant tea trade landscape that businesses can leverage to establish their presence and cater to the preferences of tea enthusiasts worldwide. Looking ahead to 2023, the US tea market is expected to generate an impressive revenue of $15.01 billion, offering businesses an excellent opportunity to tap into the growing demand for top-notch tea products, including loose-leaf tea and tea blends.To succeed in the tea market, companies must focus on producing high-quality products that cater to the preferences of tea enthusiasts, considering different tea types and flavor profiles. Exporters must also be mindful of regulations and standards in target markets to avoid product rejection.  Tea Industry Challenges: Addressing Supply Chain and Sustainability Concerns The tea industry is grappling with significant challenges related to supply chain inefficiencies and sustainability concerns. The growing global demand for tea has exacerbated supply chain issues, leading to problems in transportation, storage, and distribution. According to the World Bank, these inefficiencies cost the tea industry billions annually. Moreover, there is mounting pressure on tea producers to adopt sustainable practices and reduce their environmental impact. A survey conducted by the Ethical Tea Partnership revealed that sustainability is a priority for 82% of tea companies. To address these challenges, tea companies must focus on building resilient supply chains through technology adoption and collaboration with stakeholders. Additionally, prioritizing sustainability in operations can lead to financial benefits, such as cost savings through energy efficiency measures. Top 20 Countries With Highest Tea Consumptionwong yu liang/Shutterstock.comOur Methodology Our methodology involved researching data on countries with the highest tea consumption per capita.

If I was black, I would not have been terminated. I was terminated because I complained of and objected to race discrimination.""In closing arguments last week, Phillips' lawyer Laura Mattiacci told jurors that Starbucks had been looking for a “sacrificial lamb” to calm public outrage after the arrests, according to a report in Law360.Although the coffee chain denied that the sacking was racially motivated, a jury in US District Court in New Jersey agreed that the employee's race was a determining factor in her dismissal and has been ordered to pay her $600,000 in compensatory damages and $25 million in punitive damages.The aftermath of the controversial arrestsThe verdict comes over 5 years after a 2018 Starbucks arrest that sparked widespread backlash and allegedly led to Phillips being let go.Donte Robinson and Rashon Nelson were asked to leave the Philadelphia branch after sitting at a table and asking to use the restroom without ordering anything. The two men declined to leave because they were waiting for a business associate.They were captured on camera being forced out of the coffee shop in handcuffs after a store manager called the police on them for trespassing.The arrests sparked protests and drew criticism from African American leaders who demanded Starbucks take action.Story continuesTo try to alleviate the PR crisis on its hands, Starbucks then-CEO Kevin Johnson issued an apology and closed about 8,000 company-owned stores for an afternoon of mandatory anti-bias training for around 175,000 employees.As part of these efforts, Phillips claimed she was instructed by her superiors to suspend a white employee, even though he was not involved and did not oversee the store where the incident took place.She argued in the lawsuit that she had no performance-based reason to suspend him and that the store in question was in fact overseen by a Black district manager who was not facing discipline.Shortly after that, Phillips claimed she was fired and was only told her situation was ""not recoverable"".Starbucks blamed the manager’s “absence of leadership”Starbucks denied in court filings that Phillips' race had anything to do with her dismissal and instead pointed to her leadership skills and handling of the situation that led to her sacking.“Senior leaders and members of Partner Resources all observed Ms. Phillips demonstrate a complete absence of leadership during this crisis,” Starbucks said in a 2021 court filing.Phillips “appeared overwhelmed and lacked awareness of how critical the situation had become,” the company argued, while adding that Phillips’ manager ultimately decided to dismiss her “because strong leadership was essential during that time.”However, Phillips claimed in the lawsuit that she engaged in ""crisis management"" and took steps to ensure that the retail locations she oversaw ""were a safe and welcoming environment for all customers, regardless of race"" in the wake of the arrests.Fortune has contacted Starbucks to comment on the verdict.The coffee conglomerate also previously reached a settlement with Robinson and Nelson for an undisclosed sum and an offer of free college education. Meanwhile, the city of Philadelphia was ordered to pay a symbolic $1 to each man, and officials promised to set up a $200,000 program for young entrepreneurs.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

HST recently announced a 25% sequential hike in its second-quarter 2023 cash dividend payment to 15 cents per share from 12 cents paid out earlier.The increased dividend will be paid out on Jul 17 to shareholders on record as of Jun 30, 2023. With this latest hike, HST’s annual dividend yield now comes to 3.43% based on the company’s share price of $17.46 on Jun 14, 2023. Moreover, the company has increased its dividend five times in the last five years. Check Host Hotels’ dividend history here.Solid dividend payouts are the biggest enticements for real estate investment trust (REIT) investors, and Host Hotels has remained committed to that. After a brief suspension of its dividend payments during the pandemic, in February 2022, the company reinstated its dividend payment and announced a regular quarterly cash dividend of 3 cents per share.Moreover, backed by accelerated lodging recovery in first-quarter 2022, Host Hotels doubled its dividend to 6 cents per share from 3 cents paid out earlier. Further, in August 2022, given its solid second-quarter 2022 results, it again doubled its quarterly cash dividend to 12 cents. Although the payment is lower than the pre-pandemic level of 20 cents, these efforts to increase the dividend are encouraging.This lodging REIT has a portfolio of luxury and upper-upscale hotels in the United States and abroad. With the industry rebounding in the wake of the pandemic, HST’s well-located properties in markets with strong demand drivers are likely to benefit.The continued momentum in leisure travel demand has fueled demand for the company’s properties. Also, healthy demand from small and medium-sized businesses, representing a large share of the company’s corporate demand, has aided business transient recovery.  In the first quarter of 2023, HST reported comparable revenue per available room (RevPAR) of $217.77, rising 31.1% from the year-ago quarter’s $166.12. It was the fourth consecutive quarter where RevPAR exceeded the 2019 levels. Also, group revenues surpassed 2019 levels for the third straight quarter, driven by 14% growth in rates.HST maintains a healthy balance sheet and is the only company with an investment-grade rating among lodging REITs. Its total available liquidity totaled $2.3 billion as of Mar 31, 2023. Moreover, it has no material maturities until April 2024. With ample financial flexibility, HST remains well-poised to tide over any challenges and bank on growth scopes.Hence, with improving operating fundamentals, a lower dividend payout ratio compared with the industry and a solid financial position, we expect the latest dividend rate to be sustainable.Shares of this Zacks Rank#3 (Hold) company have gained 8.8% in the year-to-date period against the industry’s fall of 1.3%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are Ventas VTR, Rexford Industrial Realty REXR and Innovative Industrial Properties IIPR.

The June FOMC marked the first pause of the current interest rate hike cycle after 10 consecutive FOMC meetings.However, Powell also mentioned that more rate hikes are likely this year. The Fed’s current “dot-plot” shows that the mean expectation of officials is for another 50-basis point raise in the benchmark interest rate. This implies, two more rate hikes of 25 basis points each within 2023.The terminal interest rate is at present 5.6%, instead of 5.125%, anticipated after the May FOMC meeting. No rate cut is expected this year. The first cut in interest rate may be delayed till 2025. Majority of market participants were expecting the first rate cut in 2024.U.S. stock markets may remain volatile for the rest of this year following the central bank’s indication that the higher rate regime is not yet over. Mid-sized banks have already seen the burden of higher interest rates. The housing sector is likely to become more volatile.Several key economic metrics like retail sales, manufacturing PMI, services PMI and industrial production have been declining steadily in 2023. A large section of economists and financial researchers have warned of a recession later this year.Stocks in FocusAt this stage, dividend-paying stocks should be in demand as investors try to safeguard their portfolios. We believe that one should consider stocks that have recently raised their dividend payments. Five such companies are - Caterpillar Inc. CAT, Banco Bradesco S.A. BBD, Itaú Unibanco Holding S.A. ITUB, W. R. Berkley Corp. WRB and Host Hotels &amp; Resorts Inc. HST.Caterpillar has seen year-over-year revenue and earnings growth for nine straight quarters thanks to its cost-saving actions, strong end-market demand and pricing actions that offset the impact of supply chain snarls and cost pressures. We expect the company’s adjusted earnings per share for 2023 to grow 19% and revenues to rise 7%.Story continuesThe Construction Industries segment of CAT is expected to benefit from rising construction activities in the United States and other parts of the world. Backed by demand for commodities fueled by the energy-transition trend, a thriving mining sector will aid the Resource Industries segment. A strong liquidity position, investments in expanding services and digital initiatives should help CAT deliver outsized returns. Caterpillar currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Strengthening AWS offerings, which are constantly driving the company's cloud customer momentum, remains the key catalyst.The latest partnership of identity verification provider Veriff with AWS is a testament to the same.On the back of this partnership, the former expands the usage of the AWS cloud platform. Moreover, Veriff is reinforcing its IT infrastructure with AWS in order to stay alert of fraudulent attacks.Further, it is leveraging the machine learning capabilities of AWS to accelerate the development of new identity verification solutions for various sectors.More precisely, Veriff is using Amazon EC2 instances with the NVIDIA GPU.This way, Veriff will be able to boost the training process and deploy its identity verification technology models, which in turn will aid it in countering the threat of fraud attacks.The latest partnership highlights the efficiency and reliability of AWS's innovative cloud products and services.Amazon.com, Inc.

72,0e00d8ef-104b-3517-95b3-99ceecb5ec3b,PM,2023-06-16,Top 20 Countries With Least Smokers,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-20-countries-least-smokers-151158029.html,1686841918,STORY,['PM'],"[In this piece, we will take a look at top 20 countries with the least smokers. If you want to skip our introduction and analysis of the tobacco and cigarette industry and want to jump ahead to the countries with the lowest percentage of daily smokers, head on over to Top 5 Countries With Least Smokers. The ability to mass produce products has managed to significantly improve modern day standards of living. Whether it's a smartphone, clothes, or even something as simple as toothpaste, the fact that machines are capable of producing millions of these products has allowed humanity to collectively benefit from the advances in technology.However, at the same time, the ability to mass produce cigarettes has caused significant loss of life as well. You might be surprised to hear that while the peak number of deaths in the second world war is estimated to sit at 60 million people, data shows that in the 20th century, a stunning 100 million people had lost their lives due to tobacco use. This death toll has its economic impact as well, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimating that smoking cost a whopping $600 billion in economic impact in the U.S. in 2018. Out of this, the lion's share goes to lost productivity due to both health problems and death, with both accounting for $180 billion, each. Additionally, $240 billion is spent on healthcare to navigate debilitating and deadly diseases from smoking such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) and cancer.Additionally, while smoking alone is dangerous, daily smoking is the deadliest form of smoking. On this front, data from Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) sheds some light on the percentage of daily smokers in countries around the globe. Its data shows that the highest percentage of daily smokers are in several countries such as Russia, China, Ukraine, other Eastern European countries, and some North African countries. On the flip side, the lowest percentage of daily smokers, i.e., males who smoke cigarettes daily, is only in a few countries. The countries with the least percentage of daily male smokers include Mexico, Sudan, Ethiopia, Liberia, Guinea, Ecuador, Suriname, and Panama.Story continuesHowever, the picture shifts starkly when we take a look at the percentage of daily smokers in women. In fact, over here, nearly every country has the least percentage of daily smokers. There's nearly a laundry list of such countries where the percentage of women who smoke daily sits below 2.5%. These include Iran, China, nearly all of Africa, Antigua and Barbuda, St Vincent and the Grenadines, and Timor-Leste.Shifting our focus to data from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, only one country out of the data for 43 has a percentage of daily smokers that is higher than 30%. This country is Indonesia, which is known the world over for its high cigarette consumption. On the other hand, roughly a quarter of the countries have some of the lowest percentages of daily smokers. These are eleven nations, led by Iceland at the bottom with 7.2% of people smoking daily and Sweden at the top with 9.5%. As a whole though, nearly half, or nineteen countries have half the percentage of daily smokers as the world leader Indonesia.Safe to say, Indonesia isn't ranking high on any list of countries with the lowest percentage of daily smokers soon. However, one country that is improving in this area is New Zealand. It has some of the lowest levels of daily smokers, which dropped from 9.4% in 2020 (also mentioned in the OECD data above) to 8% in 2022 - the lowest in its history since data was first recorded. New Zealand has a strict policy on smoking and has banned its younger generations from being able to purchase cigarettes - ever. A country that has means business in its fight against smoking also has a low percentage of daily smokers - maybe there's something that all countries can learn from New Zealand.And while women in most countries are like to smoke less daily, this isn't true for their counterparts in America. More data from the CDC shows that 10.1% of adult American women smoke daily, just a couple of percentage points shy of the percentage of men (13.1%) with the same amount of cigarette consumption. Finally, looking at Europe, data from Eurostat confirms that Iceland, Sweden, and Norway are the countries with the least percentage of daily smokers in the continent. If, in addition to smoking statistics, you're interested in looking at which countries make the best tobacco, be sure to check out 12 Countries that Produce the Best Tobacco in the World.Topping our analysis with the current state of the tobacco industry, the management of Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) shared during the firm's fourth quarter of 2022 earnings conference:The picture for 2023 is quite different while our gross margin will face increased inflationary pressure, this is now primarily due to COGS for the cigarette business as leaf, acetate tow, salaries and energy cost increase. An acceleration in combustible pricing and lower air freight cost will serve to mitigate this exceptional inflation. However, a time lag is built into our projections. Importantly, while cost inflation is also headwind for IQOS, the 2023 margin impact of our heat-not-burn business is expected to be favorable due to the positive impact of increased HTU volume at higher net revenue per unit, planned ILUMA efficiencies and a more measured increase in device volumes. Overall, this underlying strength from IQOS combined with pricing will not be sufficient to offset combustible cost inflation in 2023, however, we expect a lower organic gross margin decline compared to last year and for our heat-not-burn business, to have an increasingly visible positive impact as we approach 2024.Apart from Philip Morris, other big smoking companies are British American Tobacco p.l.c. (NYSE:BTI), Imperial Brands PLC (OTCMKTS:IMBBY), Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO), and Japan Tobacco Inc. (OTCMKTS:JAPAF). With these details in mind, let's take a look at countries with the least smokers in the world. For a complete list of top tobacco companies, take a look at 10 Best Tobacco and Cigarette Stocks To Buy.Top 20 Countries with Least SmokersOur Methodology To compile our list of countries with the lowest percentage of smokers, we used data from the World Health Organization (WHO) for the percentage of tobacco smokers ranked by country.

The company's stock saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NYSE over the last few months. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at TransDigm Group’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for TransDigm Group What's The Opportunity In TransDigm Group?According to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average, the stock currently looks expensive. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that TransDigm Group’s ratio of 47.28x is above its peer average of 25.43x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Given that TransDigm Group’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What does the future of TransDigm Group look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. TransDigm Group's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 83%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? TDG’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe TDG should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on TDG for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for TDG, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks.

Therefore, they are deemed to be people of influence. As such, it is a legal requirement for politicians to disclose when they buy and sell stocks.While politicians often have differing motiviations for investing in stocks than professional value investors, this information can be useful to see which stocks these figures of influence are bullish on. This also has the benefit of providing unique insight as a starting point for further research.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with ADI. Click here to check it out. ADI 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of ADIPeter Lynch Chart of ADIIn this discussion, I will take a look at two stocks politicians have been buying in the last three months. Let's dive inThe information regarding politician buys and sells comes from regulatory filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. According to the STOCK Act, which was passed in 2012, members of Congress are required by law to file any stock trades with the SEC within 45 days. It is to prohibit members of Congress and employees of Congress from using private information derived from their official positions for personal benefit, and for other purposes. The bill also applies to all employees in the Executive and Judicial branches of the federal government.Analog DevicesAnalog Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) has recorded a total of four purchase transactions in the past three months among politicians. The majority of the trades have been by Congressman Jared Moskowitz of Florida.What does the company do?Analog Devices is a semiconductor company specializing in the design, development and manufacturing of analog and digital signal processing integrated circuits.Its product applications include automotive, consumer electronics and communications equipment.One of its most innovative products is a gigabit multimedia serial link (GMSL). This is the freeway which will enable smart and automotive vehicles to communicate with infotainment, the cloud and much more.Story continuesIts other solutions include a 3D time of flight LIDAR camera system, which enables industrial robots in warehouses to easily assess a package's size as it moves along a conveyor belt.2 Quality Stocks Politicians Have Been BuyingGrowing financials Analog Devices reported strong financial results for the second quarter of 2023 on May 24. Its revenue of $3.26 billion beat analyst forecasts by $56.75 million and rose by 9.79% year over year.This growth rate was not as fast as the 21% reported in the prior quarter and the 79% growth reported in the previous year. However, the business still reported strong results overall given the cyclical pullback in the semiconductor industry.Part of Analog Devices' positive results have been driven by its strong presence in the stable and growing health care industry. The company has become a leader in medical imaging, with strong market share in the devices which make up x-ray machines, ultrasound and CT scanners.2 Quality Stocks Politicians Have Been BuyingIn addition, its products help with instrumentation such as ventilators and defibrillators, which became vital during the pandemic. Personal health monitoring is another growing trend the company is poised to benefit from. Wearable health care devices require low power consumption and high performance, which is perfectly suited to Analog Devices' chips.The company also reported solid 16% growth in its aerospace and defense solutions, which is also not as cyclical as consumer segments. Its automotive segment contributed to 24% of total revenue and grew 24% year over year.Communications was an area of weakness as its consumer applications declined by 20% quarter over quarter due to the cyclical environment.Moving onto profitability, its gross margin was a solid 73.7%, which was up slightly versus the prior quarter.Its operating margin was a solid 35%, with $1.1 billion in operating income generated up 19.35% year over year.2 Quality Stocks Politicians Have Been BuyingThe business reported earnings per share of $1.92, which beat analyst forecasts by 9 cents.Over the trailing 12 months, Analog Devices has generated a staggering $4 billion in free cash flow, or approximately 31% of revenue, which is fantastic.The company also reported $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet. The business does have fairly high total debt of $6.7 billion, but the majority is long-term debt.The business pays a consistent forward dividend yield of 1.83% and has been buying back shares.ValuationAnalog Devices trades with a price-earnings ratio of 27, which is higher than the average of 25 for the sector. However, it is 25% cheaper than its five-year average.2 Quality Stocks Politicians Have Been BuyingThe GF Value Line indicates a fair value of $212 per share. Based on its historical ratios, past performance and analysts' future earnings projections, the stock is fairly valued at the time of writing.2 Quality Stocks Politicians Have Been BuyingSimon Property GroupSimon Property Group Inc. (NYSE:SPG) is a real estate investment trust that focuses on buying, developing and managing properties in the retail sector, including shopping malls, premium retail outlets and mixed-use developments.Its famous properties include The Mall of America in Minnesota, which is one of the largest malls in the U.S. In addition, the business owns The Forum Shops at Caesars Palace, Sawgrass Mill in Florida and even Bicester Village in the U.K.The stock was purchased multiple times in the past three months by Victoria Spartz, a representative from Indiana.2 Quality Stocks Politicians Have Been BuyingSolid financials Simon Property Group reported financial results for the first quarter of 2023 on May 2. Its revenue of $1.35 billion beat analyst forecasts by $84 million and rose by 4.24% year over year.This was a solid result given the many challenges brick-and-mortar retail outlets have faced since the lockdowns in 2020. The continued growth in e-commerce also makes these outlets optional as opposed to necessary.Despite these challenges, Simon Property Group reported a strong occupancy rate of 94.4%, which increased by 110 basis points year over year. Its average base minimum rent was $55.84 per square foot, rising 3.1% year over year.2 Quality Stocks Politicians Have Been BuyingThe company has built up strong momentum with its leases, signing 1,200 in the first quarter for a total of 5.9 million square feet. The business also reported a strong rebound in its tourist-focused centers. In addition, it opened a new West Paris Designer Outlet in Normandy, France, which indicates the demand for these type of outlets is still strong.Simon Property Group is currently constructing another high-end outlet in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which it expects to open by the fall of 2024. Its total pipeline includes around 2,000 residential units and hotel rooms across various projects.The REIT reported strong operating income of $662 million, which rose by close to 7% year over year. Its cash and cash equivalents rose to $1.5 billion, up from $621 million in the prior quarter.Its total liquidity was a solid $9.3 billion, which includes a $5 billion revolving credit facility that adds increased flexibility.2 Quality Stocks Politicians Have Been BuyingAs a REIT, Simon Property Group pays a strong dividend of 3.32%, or $1.85 per share, up 9% year over year.ValuationThe stock trades at a price-to-funds from operations ratio of 9, which is 25% cheaper than its five-year average. Further, its price-to-adjusted funds from operations ratio of 10 is 31% cheaper over the same period.In addition, the company's price-to-cash flow ratio of 9.45 is 18% cheaper than its historic levels.The GF Value Line also indicates a fair value of around $120 per share. Therefore, the stock is fairly valued at the time of writing.2 Quality Stocks Politicians Have Been BuyingFinal thoughts Both Analog Devices and Simon Property Group are high-quality companies that politicians have been buying. Analog Devices is uniquely positioned to continue to grow despite a macro pullback in the semiconductor market as a whole. Simon Property Group is also an interesting business. At a macro level, I would assume it would be struggling due to macro headwinds. However, management's execution and its popular tourist locations have debunked this expectation.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Linde plc (LIN), S&amp;P Global Inc. (SPGI) and AT&amp;T Inc. (T). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Linde shares have outperformed the Zacks Chemical - Specialty industry (+29% vs. +13.7%) as well as the broader market (+29% vs. +19.3% for the S&amp;P 500) over the past year reflecting robust demand for its industrial gases. The company’s primary products in industrial gases include oxygen, which is used as life support in hospitals.Linde has long-term contracts with on-site customers backed by minimum purchase requirements, thereby securing stable cashflows. In the profitable industrial gas market, the merger of Praxair and Linde has created an efficient player with considerable size advantages.However, the cost of sales continues to increase, hurting the firm’s bottom line. Also, high leverage may limit its financial flexibility. The firm has mostly been paying a lower dividend yield than the industry’s composite stocks over the past two years.(You can read the full research report on Linde here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of S&amp;P Global have outperformed the Zacks Business - Information Services industry over the past year (+26.1% vs. +15.4%). The company remains well poised to gain from growing demand for business information services. Buyouts help innovate, increase differentiated content and develop new products.Effective management execution has helped it generate solid cash flow which is utilized for growth initiatives. Dividend payments and share buybacks boost investors confidence and positively impact earnings per share.However, S&amp;P Global remains vulnerable to proceedings, investigations and inquiries with respect to the ratings provided, leading to legal charges, damages or fines. Growth initiatives, higher compensations and incentives raise the company's expenses. Decreasing current ratio is not desirable as it indicates that the company may have problems meeting its short-term debt obligations.(You can read the full research report on S&amp;P Global here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of AT&amp;T have declined -11.4% over the past year against the Zacks Wireless National industry’s decline of -12.1%. The company is facing a steady decline in linear TV subscribers and legacy services. As the company tries to woo customers with healthy discounts, freebies and cash credits, margin pressures tend to escalate. This is likely to affect its growth potential to some extent. High debt burden is also worrisome.However, AT&amp;T is focused on business transformation efforts to augment operational efficiency and facilitate optimum resource utilization to enhance value and lower operating costs.A customer-centric business model alongside a lower churn rate and higher-tier unlimited plans is providing robust growth in its postpaid wireless business. An integrated fiber expansion strategy is expected to improve the broadband connectivity for both enterprise and consumer markets, while steady 5G deployments are likely to boost end-user experience.(You can read the full research report on AT&amp;T here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Oracle Corporation (ORCL), HCA Healthcare, Inc.

However, Crop Science division is facing pricing challenges for glyphosate-based products which will impact performance.Edwards (EW) Rides on Solid TMTT Sales and Global ProspectsEdwards' strong TMTT sales globally is a major positive. Per the Zacks analyst, differentiated therapies, positive pivotal trial results and favorable real-world clinical outcomes are the key drivers.Investments Aid Sempra (SRE), Severe Weather Impact WoesPer the Zacks analyst, systematic investments boost Sempra's infrastructure. Yet, its operations are subject to severe weather which can materially increase costs, and impact its earnings.CrowdStrike (CRWD) Rides on Product Strengt, AcquisitionsPer the Zacks analyst, CrowdStrike is gaining from solid contributions of its growth-oriented products, primarily Falcon platform.

PPG has announced a collaboration with Satys, a France-based industrial organization that specializes in aircraft sealing, painting and surface treatment, to supply electrocoating (e-coat) of original equipment manufacture (OEM) aircraft parts. Satys will install a PPG AEROCRON e-coat priming system at its facility in Dugny, France, under the terms of the deal.Metal aircraft parts are dipped into a solution of chrome-free electrocoat primer and charged with electrical current to apply the coating, resulting in an even surface finish, constant coating thickness and no drips, runs, or sags in the cured paint film utilizing PPG Aerocron technology. E-coat is a waterborne, sustainable technology that generates little waste, has low volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and helps minimize airplane fuel consumption due to weight savings from less paint usage.The 2,100-gallon (eight cubic meters) e-coat tank at Dugny will be Europe's largest, allowing a single operator to coat many pieces simultaneously, enhancing process efficiency. The coated parts are resistant to corrosion and chemicals and are compatible with industry-standard pre-treatments and topcoats.Shares of PPG have gained 29.7% over the past year compared with a 13.8% rise of its industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company, on its first-quarter call, noted that it expects adjusted earnings of $6.95-$7.25 per share for 2023. The prediction excludes amortization expense, non-cash pension settlement charge, benefit from insurance recovery and costs related to earlier approved and communicated business restructuring.Factoring in current global economic activities, geopolitical issues in Europe and higher interest rates in most developed countries, PPG expects sales volumes in second-quarter 2023 to be flat with the potential for slight improvement or decrease of a low single-digit percentage year over year.

He left the bank shortly after.Mr Dell had a camera on for a work project but forgot to turn it off and recorded himself engaging in sexually explicit activities, an internal review found.After receiving the video, the woman hired a lawyer who sought around $30m (£23.5m) in damages on her behalf.Mr Dell, whose brother is the billionaire computer entrepreneur Michael Dell, ultimately reached an agreement to pay a multi-million dollar settlement to resolve the 2020 incident. He has since left the bank.Goldman Sachs has disputed the report, saying it contained “significant factual errors”.A long time entrepreneur and venture capitalist, Mr Dell joined Goldman in 2018 as a partner after the bank bought a personal-finance app he founded.The fintech entrepreneur is a known figure within New York’s elite social scene after engaging in a long-running on-again, off-again relationship with Padma Lakshmi, who is best-known in the US for hosting cooking show Top Chef.The pair began dating in 2009, two years after Ms Lakshmi’s divorce from novelist Salman Rushdie, whom she married in 2004.Mr Dell and Ms Lakshmi have an 13-year-old daughter together and were involved in a high-profile and well-publicised battle over custody in 2012. The couple are said to have amicably split in 2021, according to the New York Post.The sexually explicit video incident at Goldman Sachs triggered an internal review involving the highest levels of the bank, according to Bloomberg, including its chief executive David Solomon.Tony Fratto, Goldman Sachs’ global head of communications, said: “As we told Bloomberg, their reporting contains significant factual errors and continues a pattern of leveraging unreliable sources. This reporting fails to meet fundamental journalistic standards.”Story continuesA spokesman for the bank declined to elaborate on what the errors were.Mr Dell was contacted for comment.The case is not the first instance of sexually explicit videos being shares accidentally as a result of working from home.Jeffrey Toobin, a former star legal reporter at The New Yorker magazine, was fired in 2020 after exposing himself on a Zoom call. Mr Toobin did not realise he was still visible to colleagues after switching between screens.He said at the time: “I made an embarrassingly stupid mistake, believing I was off camera. I apologize to my wife, family, friends and co-workers.”Jeffrey Toobin - Evan Agostini/InvisionThe report on Mr Dell’s accidental explicit video also comes as companies on Wall Street and in the Square Mile attempt to fight off accusations that they have an overly macho culture and are failing to promote enough women to senior positions.Goldman Sachs last month agreed to pay $215m (£170m) to settle a long-running lawsuit that alleged the bank underpaid female bankers for years.The Wall Street giant struck a deal with lawyers representing nearly 3,000 female associates and vice presidents who worked at the lender and claimed they were undervalued by male bosses.Goldman said it would hire an independent expert “to conduct an additional analysis on performance evaluation processes” at the bank, as well as conduct “pay equity studies”.The bank has said that improving gender diversity in its top ranks is a key priority and has struggled with a legacy of some women feeling unwelcome.Last year, a former female managing director released a book about her time at the bank, which included allegations of overt sexism and bullying.Jamie Fiore Higgins, who worked at the investment bank for 17 years, claimed to have been “mooed” at by her male colleagues when she used a lactation room after the birth of her second child.She also alleged that one of her bosses propositioned her at a work conference.At the time, a spokesman for Goldman said it strongly disagreed with Ms. Higgins’ characterization of the bank’s culture and declined to respond to “anonymised allegations”. Mr Dell left Goldman in April 2021, according to his LinkedIn profile. He went on to found a cryptocurrency business called Domain Money last year.The reporting of the alleged incident shortly before his departure comes as Goldman Sachs is said to be facing discontent among its own staff over the leadership of Mr Solomon.The Wall Street Journal reported this week that some partners are unhappy with, among other things, Mr Solomon’s hobby of DJing. The 61-year-old, who has used the stage name DJ D-Sol, regularly plays house music gigs and last year used the bank’s private jet to reach a gig in Chicago.The bank has disputed that staff are unhappy with a spokesman saying last year: “David Solomon is singularly focused on the success of Goldman Sachs, tirelessly engaging with our clients and people,”Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

GS is eliminating more than 30 investment banking (IB) positions in the Asia region to survive the current uncertain economic conditions. Per sources familiar with the matter, the primary reason for this decision is the plunge in global dealmaking and trading revenues.The company's Global Banking &amp; Markets division has witnessed the majority of the regional job cuts. In Asia, China-focused IB professionals who are based in Beijing and Hong Kong were affected the most, with nine equities capital markets bankers being sacked, along with the managing director, per the persons familiar with the matter.In its new round of layoffs globally, Goldman is likely to cut less than 250 jobs in the coming weeks, including the above-mentioned cuts in Asia. During the first quarter of 2023, GS trimmed its headcount by 3,200, its biggest round of layoffs since the 2008 financial crisis. Last year, the company also cut about 500 jobs.Over the past six months, shares of GS have declined 2.3% compared with the industry’s fall of 7.9%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCurrently, the company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The job cuts are taking place across the company, with the majority of these occurring in the banking, markets and functions divisions.

88,759fba0d-338e-300c-a0e3-78a1b2fff195,SLB,2023-06-16,Schlumberger Limited's (NYSE:SLB) Stock Is Going Strong: Is the Market Following Fundamentals?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schlumberger-limiteds-nyse-slb-stock-120022771.html,1686916822,STORY,['SLB'],"[Schlumberger's (NYSE:SLB) stock is up by a considerable 11% over the past month. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. In this article, we decided to focus on Schlumberger's  ROE.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Schlumberger How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Schlumberger is:21% = US$3.9b ÷ US$18b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.21.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.A Side By Side comparison of Schlumberger's Earnings Growth And 21% ROETo begin with, Schlumberger seems to have a respectable ROE. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 11% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. This certainly adds some context to Schlumberger's exceptional 23% net income growth seen over the past five years. However, there could also be other causes behind this growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Schlumberger's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 5.4% in the same period, which is great to see.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is SLB fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Schlumberger Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Schlumberger has a three-year median payout ratio of 28% (where it is retaining 72% of its income) which is not too low or not too high. By the looks of it, the dividend is well covered and Schlumberger is reinvesting its profits efficiently as evidenced by its exceptional growth which we discussed above.Moreover, Schlumberger is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 32%. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that Schlumberger's future ROE will be 24% which is again, similar to the current ROE.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that Schlumberger's performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.Perrigo (PRGO) is a stock many investors are watching right now. PRGO is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock holds a P/E ratio of 11.81, while its industry has an average P/E of 21.93. Over the past year, PRGO's Forward P/E has been as high as 16.89 and as low as 11.09, with a median of 13.28.Value investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. PRGO has a P/S ratio of 1. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.54.Finally, we should also recognize that PRGO has a P/CF ratio of 20.60. This figure highlights a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find firms that are undervalued when considering their impressive cash outlook. PRGO's P/CF compares to its industry's average P/CF of 32.33.

PDCO is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its broad product line. The optimism led by a solid third-quarter fiscal 2023 performance and a few notable acquisitions are expected to contribute further. Integration risks and stiff competitive forces persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 4.2% against the 18% rise of the industry and the S&amp;P 500’s 15.5% growth.The renowned global dental and animal health company has a market capitalization of $2.65 billion. The company projects 7.2% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance.

Prudent cost-saving initiatives and solid sales execution continue to favor Patterson Companies.Story continuesDownsidesStiff Competition: The U.S. dental products distribution industry is highly competitive and consists chiefly of national, regional and local full-service and mail-order distributors.

Regular acquisitions are also a distraction for management which is likely to impact organic growth.

The system then is expected to automatically transfer samples to the physically integrated BD FACSLyric Clinical Flow Cytometry System without human interaction.As the BD FACSDuet Premium System is integrated with the flow cytometer, it enables a workflow solution that needs fewer manual steps, resources and less user hands-on time, unlike previous solutions.BD’s management expects to usher in greater levels of automation in clinical lab workflow with the aid of the FACSDuet Premium System along with its flagship BD FACSLyric Flow Cytometry System. Management believes that more automation will enable its customers to focus more time on analyzing and interpreting samples and impacting outcomes.Industry ProspectsPer a report by BCC Research, the global market for flow cytometry was valued at $5.2 billion in 2022 and is expected to reach $7.6 billion in 2027 at a CAGR of 8%. Factors like technological advancements, the increasing trend toward single-cell analysis and the growing adoption of flow cytometry in clinical applications are likely to drive the market.Story continuesGiven the market potential, the latest launch is expected to significantly strengthen BD’s business worldwide.Notable Developments in Life Sciences ArmLast month, BD announced the worldwide commercial launch of a new-to-world cell sorting instrument, BD FACSDiscover S8 Cell Sorter, featuring two breakthrough technologies (BD SpectralFX Technology and BD CellView Image Technology).The same month, BD received the FDA’s 510(k) clearance for the new BD Kiestra Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus imaging application. The application uses artificial intelligence to interpret bacterial growth and release negative specimens with minimal human interaction.Also, in May, BD announced its second-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein it recorded solid top-line and bottom-line results and improvements in the overall base revenues. Robust performances by both geographic regions were also seen. The BD Life Sciences segment’s Integrated Diagnostic Solutions business unit saw growth in Microbiology.

With the launch of the SmileMaker Platform in the U.S. market and the rollout of the CarePlus offering, the company’s successful investments in innovations buoy optimism. The gross margin expansion in the first quarter is encouraging.However, operating in a tough competitive space amid continued macroeconomic headwinds is concerning.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has decreased 63.6% against the 19.7% growth of the industry and a 17.3% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned oral care company has a market capitalization of $161.4 million. SDC projects a long-term estimated earnings growth rate of 20.3%, ahead of the industry’s expected growth rate of 11.6%. SmileDirectClub delivered an average negative earnings surprise of 0.81% in the trailing four quarters.Let’s delve deeper.Factors at PlayInnovations Aid Growth: In May 2023, SmileDirectClub announced the launch of its innovative SMP in the United States, expanding its patented technology to its largest market. The technology is an industry first, upgrading current 2D remote scanning options and introducing real-time AI to capture a 3D view of teeth.Earlier in February, SDC launched its new premium aligner treatment, CarePlus which is presently available at select Partner Network dentist locations. The company also announced the addition of a new Sensitivity-Free Whitening Kit to its innovative suite of premium, affordable oral care products.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStrategic Alliances Add Value: In terms of retail partnerships, SmileDirectClub’s oral care products are now available at more than 12,500 retail stores nationwide, including Walmart, CVS, Walgreens, and Sam's Club. In the first quarter, SDC introduced sales specialists in targeted partner network practices to better educate customers about the differences between its two service offerings, CarePlus and traditional virtual care offering.Story continuesLong-Term Growth Targets: SmileDirectClub’s long-term strategy includes achieving the average revenue growth target of 20%-30% per year and adjusted EBITDA margins of 25%-30% for the next five years. This implies a long-term target on a sequential basis of 5% -7% each quarter. Per the company, this long-term revenue target reflects the efforts to capture market share while improving customer experience.For 2023, SmileDirectClub expects total core business revenues in the range of $400-$450 million. SDC’s revenues in the first quarter of 2023 were well ahead of estimates.DownsidesQ1 Negatives: The company posted a year-over-year decline in revenues due to persistent macroeconomic headwinds, driven by high inflation that impacted its customer base. Earnings for the quarter missed estimates. Meanwhile, the operating loss trend continued, with the company posting a narrower loss in the first quarter, than the year-ago adjusted figure.A Tough Competitive Landscape: SmileDirectClub competes with a handful of smaller companies that collectively have a limited market share in the clear aligner industry, including Candid Co., Byte (Dentsply) and SnapCorrect. Following the introduction of the company’s collaborative and wholesale partner network, it also faces competition from more well-established competitors in the traditional orthodontic industry, which requires in-person visits, such as Align Technology, Inc.Estimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for SmileDirectClub’s 2023 loss per share has remained constant at 42 cents in the past 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $433.9 million.

HOLX is gaining from continued strength in GYN Surgical and Breast Health businesses. The company’s focus on international operations is encouraging. Strong solvency is an added advantage. However, stiff competition and currency headwinds do not bode well.In the past six months, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has gained 16.5% compared with a 17.9% growth of the industry and a 21.4% rise of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned medical device company has a market capitalization of $19.29 billion. Its earnings in second-quarter fiscal 2023 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 20.5%.Let’s delve deeper.Factors at PlayStrength in GYN Surgical: Over the past few years, the GYN Surgical business has transformed to the most profitable division of Hologic on a percentage basis. It is banking on new leadership, strong strategic execution of new commercial models and new product launches.In second quarter, GYN Surgical grew more than 25% driven by strong contributions from hysteroscopic portfolio of MyoSure, the Fluent Fluid Management System and NovaSure. HOLX is encouraged by yet another strong quarter for its latest NovaSure iteration, NovaSure V5. The laparoscopic portfolio continues to build momentum and is growing into a larger driver for the division.Strength in Breast Health: Hologic has been making impressive progress in its Breast Health arm in recent time. The company is currently focusing on expanding its strategy to diversify business across the patient continuum of care. It has also launched new software products based on its investments in artificial intelligence and has strengthened its interventional franchise via Brevera relaunch.During fiscal second quarter, the Breast Health segment returned to growth, posting 25.7% rise.Focus on International Operations: According to Hologic, global expansion will be a critical element of its growth strategy over the long term. While many of its best-in-class products command a leading share in the domestic market, they hold a disproportionately low market share internationally, indicating huge untapped potential.Story continuesHOLX’s international sales have been a major catalyst over the past three years with the molecular diagnostics business being a significant driver. Hologic is increasingly focusing on commercial infrastructure. It has been progressing impressively with respect to the placement of Panther instruments across the globe.Strong Solvency and Capital Structure: Hologic ended second-quarter fiscal 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $2.58 billion compared with $2.34 billion at the end of first-quarter fiscal 2023. Total long-term debt (including the current portion) was $2.79 billion at fiscal second-quarter end compared with $2.80 billion at the end of fiscal first quarter.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAlthough the quarter’s total debt was higher than the cash and cash equivalent level, we may note that Hologic has a short-term payable debt of $26 million on its balance sheet. This can be treated as a positive for HOLX amid the ongoing economic downturn, as it is holding sufficient cash for debt repayment.DownsidesForeign Exchange Headwinds: We remain worried about the significant challenges Hologic has been facing due to unfavorable foreign currency impact. This has been affecting HOLX’s overall performance in the past few quarters.Competitive Landscape: Hologic operates in a highly competitive industry. Its mammography, related products and subsystems compete on a worldwide basis with products offered by a number of competitors including General Electric Company, Siemens, Koninklijke Philips NV or Philips, Planmed Oy or Planmed, Agfa-Gevaert N.V.or Agfa, Carestream Health, Inc., FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation or Fuji, I.M.S. and Toshiba Corporation.Estimate TrendsIn the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Hologic’s fiscal 2023 earnings has been moved 3.9% north to $3.89 per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HOLX’s fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $4.01 billion, suggesting a 17.6% fall from the year-ago reported number.Other Stocks to ConsiderA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Merit Medical Systems, Inc.

The Writers Guild of America (WGA) went on strike in early May, partly over concerns that studios would start using generative AI, instead of humans, to write scripts.""I hope it shines a light on what they’re fighting for and why they’re fighting for it,"" Murphy said in an interview.""It’s not just writers being whiney. It’s them saying ‘Can we not be replaced by computers?’ and that’s such a scary thing for human beings to have to ask,"" she added.Actors became concerned after realistic-looking ""deepfakes"" began circulating online of stars such as Tom Cruise, Keanu Reeves and Hayek. Members of the SAG-AFTRA actors union are seeking protections on how their images are used in their negotiations with Hollywood studios.""As much as I really want people to have a good laugh and enjoy our shockingly lighthearted episode when it comes to 'Black Mirror,' I do hope that it sparks proper conversation, or many conversations, about the really terrible repercussions that AI can have if it goes too far off the rails,"" Murphy said.Murphy said she and Hayek discussed the issue during filming of ""Black Mirror.""""Her image has been used in so many terrible and disrespectful ways, so we did have conversations about that,"" Murphy said.

98,97e0398e-401e-39db-bc83-1588b4f3b1ef,NFLX,2023-06-16,How Netflix’s live sports strategy stacks up against competitors,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/netflix-live-sports-strategy-stacks-150942470.html,1686841782,VIDEO,['NFLX'],"[Netflix could be throwing it's hat in the sports ring as it reportedly undergoes talks to live-stream a celebrity golf tournament this fall. Yahoo Finance entertainment reporter Allie Canal details the streamer's foray into live sports and recent analyst price target changes.Video Transcript- Well, Netflix could be throwing its hat in the sports ring as it reportedly undergoes talks to live stream a celebrity golf tournament this fall. That's at least, according to the Wall Street Journal. So what does this mean for Netflix's sports strategy, and how does it hold up against the competition? Let's bring in our very own Allie Canal with the details.And Ali, we have heard for years from Netflix that they don't want to get into the live sports game. It is about the content around the sports discussion. Is that going to shift?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Exactly. Well, they are experimenting with different ways to bring sports to their audiences, but it's a bit untraditional compared to some of those competitors. We've seen the tech Giants like Apple, Amazon, Google, really target those big partnerships with the MLB, MLS, NFL, but Netflix is doing something different.They're exploring sports documentaries with F1 in full swing. Now, with this live celebrity golf tournament. They're going to bring some of those characters into that. So they're really creating these franchises around sports. So I spoke to an expert on this, John Christian. He leads an entertainment consulting company. I asked him, is this sustainable? Can Netflix not go after those spicy-- not spicy. Although, you could argue maybe. Pricey, I should say. Ah, sports--- Spicy and pricey.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Sports packages, which we've seen they're very, very expensive, which is one of the main reasons Netflix has stayed away from that. And he said right now, they're just trying to focus on the technology, right? Making sure that they can get live sports tech right because we know what the live, ""Love is Blind Reunion,"" that had some hiccups.Story continuesAnd if you're a sports fan, if you're watching a game and something goes wrong, you're not going to be too happy about it. So that's priority number one. He said, down the line, they might have to be forced to explore some of those pricier packages with those Major League teams or maybe, even on the collegiate level with the NCAA.But right now, it's really all about creating these connections, right? Because sports fans-- they're really the last frontier of the cord cutters. So there's a lot of untapped potential and a lot of opportunity to go after some of these games.- But it's also just more and more like cable. It's--ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, that's--- It's like what's hfft-- what's the point? I don't know. It's just silly. Anyway, the-- you know what I mean?- I was trying to think of your argument on, ""it's more like cable."" I guess, I mean--- The more stuff they offer, then like, isn't it just like getting the cable bundle again?- Still-- it's still not the same. The cost?- It's still cheaper.- Yes.- Unless you get all of the--- --really creeping up though, depending on how many services you have.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Exactly.- So I guess, what I'm saying is what's the differentiation and the advantage at a certain point for-- I don't know.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Right.- Propositions just changes.ALEXANDRA CANAL: And at a certain point, I do think that's why we're going to see eventual consolidation with all of these services and all of these offerings because people aren't going to go to all these different places just to access different types of games or different types of offerings. So that's something I think that we're going to see more of down the line.- Yeah, meantime, we've seen Netflix shares rallying. They're up again today, and Wall Street has been quite bullish lately.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Oh, yeah, very bullish. I mean, the stock is up 50% year to date. More than 140% on the year. Investors are bullish. Analysts are bullish. The latest being Cowen John Blackledge, boosting his price target to $500 a share this morning, up from the prior $440. Also, reiterated his outperform rating. Now, he joins a slew of other banks boosting their price targets in recent days, including Pivotal Research, Wells Fargo, JPM, Bank of America.Pivotal Research currently has the highest price target on the street at $535 a share, but they're all pretty much in this $470 to $500 range, which suggests a lot of upside based on current levels. And you were just seeing on your screen-- 30 buys there, 24 holds and 4 sells. And this really all has to do with the ad-supported tier, along with the crackdown on password sharing. Those are two big revenue initiatives.And we're talking sports which Netflix has said, it doesn't necessarily want to pursue. But when we talk about ads and the crackdown on password sharing, they've also said in the past that they weren't going to do that. They said, they'll never be ads on Netflix. Now, we have the ad tier. They said, we'll never go after your passwords. Now, we're all feeling the impact of that. So that could be something that eventually, based on the competition out there, they could be forced to do.- It is about those additional revenue drivers, at least from an investor perspective that we see.ALEXANDRA CANAL: All about the money, baby.- Yes. All right. Thanks, Ali.]"

Also, its Real Power Real Growth value creation plan bodes well. This led to first-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein its earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate while sales beat the same.Management noted that fiscal 2023 started on a positive note on the back of solid brands and a focus on inventory discipline. AEO’s Aerie and American Eagle brands witnessed substantial improvement in the quarter and maintained strength in their categories. Adjusted earnings of 17 cents per share increased 6.3% from adjusted earnings of 16 cents reported in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Total net revenues of $1,080.9 million increased 2.5% year over year.For Aerie, sales rose 12% to $359 million while comps grew 2% in first-quarter fiscal 2023. The brand reached $1.5 billion in revenues in 2022, driven by store expansion. Strength across seasonal tops and new bottom silhouettes acted as major growth drivers. Also, its activewear extension, OFFLINE by Aerie, performed well on the back of tops, sports bras, active shorts and fashion items.Recently, Aerie launched the Real You summer campaign, which showcases its new summer collection, including the crowd-favorite Pool-To-Party capsule. Management previously launched its largest integrated marketing campaign, namely, Voices of AerieREAL. The Aerie brand is a key growth engine for American Eagle and remains on track to reach the next brand milestone of $2 billion in sales, out of which it has already achieved $1.5 billion in revenues.Also, it remains on track with its Real Power Real Growth value creation plan, which has been aiding performance. The plan is driving profitability through real estate and inventory optimization efforts, omnichannel and customer focus, and investments to improve the supply chain.As part of the Real Power Real Growth plan, American Eagle will continue to pursue opportunities to grow the Aerie brand through expansion into newer markets, innovation and a growing customer base. The company’s efforts under the plan have aided the recovery of the American Eagle brand. Going forward, it expects to undertake initiatives to deliver growth and sustained profitability for the American Eagle brand.Driven by the trends and progress on its growth plan, American Eagle raised its 2023 financial targets. The company now expects to achieve an operating income of $800 million in fiscal 2023. It also expects revenues of $5.8 billion in fiscal 2023, up from the earlier mentioned $5.5 billion.Operating income is estimated to be $800 million, with the operating margin expected to reach 13.5% by 2023. Previously, the operating income and the operating margin were anticipated to be $550 million and 10%, respectively. Earlier, the company expected revenues for the Aerie brand to reach $2.2 billion by 2023, indicating a more than 20% compound annual growth rate compared with fiscal 2019. The American Eagle brand is also envisioned to grow slightly from fiscal 2019, with $3.6 billion in revenues.However, the company has been reeling under the ongoing uncertain macro landscape and the overall consumer spending pattern. This led management to issue cautious guidance for fiscal 2023. For fiscal 2023, revenues are likely to be flat to down in the low-single digits. The operating income is anticipated to be $250-$270 million compared with the adjusted operating income of $269 million in fiscal 2022. For the fiscal second quarter, it expects revenues to decline in the low-single digits on a year-over-year basis. The company expects SG&amp;A to increase in the low to mid-single digits.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConsequently, shares of AEO have lost 12.4% in the past three months compared with the industry’s decline of 4.3%.ConclusionDespite the ongoing challenging economic landscape, we believe that solid online shows, robust demand and brand strength are likely to help the stock get back on track.

The company is benefiting from improved non-gaming revenues and expansion in domestic markets. Also, an emphasis on strategic investments and sports betting expansion bode well.An upward revision in earnings estimates for 2023 reflects analysts’ optimism regarding the company’s growth potential. In the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2023 earnings has moved up 80.2% to $1.82 per share.Key Growth DriversWYNN is benefiting from the sound demand for sports betting. It collaborated with several engaging content creators to develop unique sports-themed programs.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the first quarter of 2023, the company launched retail sports betting at Encore Boston Harbor. Following the launch, Wynn Resorts reported a 20% increase in sign-ups (year to date) to its Wynn Rewards loyalty program. The company anticipates solid revenue generation due to new product features and a unique marketing campaign.An increased focus on high-ROI development projects in Boston and the UAE bodes well. Wynn Resorts and Marjan, RAK Hospitality Holding recently reached an agreement to develop a multi-billion-dollar integrated resort on the artificial Al Marjan Island in Ras Al Khaimah, the United Arab Emirates. The resort is scheduled to open in 2026. This will mark the company’s first resort in the MENA region.In the first quarter of 2023, Wynn Resorts progressed in project designs. Also, optimism can be noted due to opportunities arising from the backdrop of beachside setting development. Coming to Boston, the company progressed with planned projects, thereby offering additional parking, food and beverage options and entertainment amenities.Wynn Resorts focuses on non-gaming avenues to drive growth. The company emphasizes introducing innovative non-gaming investments that drive increased tourism and strong shareholder returns. Going forward, WYNN remains optimistic about the strong forward group demand pipeline, ongoing pricing power for rooms, healthy handling declines and a robust programming calendar (in the second half of the year).Wynn Resorts receives a sizable portion of its income from Macau. Given that the Chinese economy is gradually picking up steam, the worst appears to be behind the Macau gambling industry. Wynn Resorts (Macau) and the Macau government came into a 10-year deal for the renewal of Wynn Macau and Wynn Palace Cotai's gaming concession in the fourth quarter of 2022.For 2023, the company expects Capex related to concession commitments in the range of $50-$220 million. Wynn Resorts believes that the proposed Capex and programming will drive growth in the upcoming periods.Story continuesHurdlesAlthough Wynn Resorts reported a solid recovery in the Macau and Las Vegas regions in the first quarter of 2023, a decline in visitation from pre-pandemic levels is a concern. During the quarter, the company witnessed soft international visitation, particularly from Europe and Latin America.Also, the dismal unrated and group business in the Macau region added to the downside. Although visitation is likely to improve in the coming months, it is expected to take time to attain pre-pandemic levels.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksWynn Resorts currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector are as follows:Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this casino operator have returned -5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +6.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Gaming industry, which Wynn falls in, has gained 3.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Wynn is expected to post earnings of $0.32 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +139%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +38%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.82 points to a change of +140.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +29.9%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.56 indicates a change of +150.7% from what Wynn is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -5.2%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Wynn is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Wynn, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $1.48 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +62.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $6.01 billion and $6.73 billion estimates indicate +59.9% and +12.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryWynn reported revenues of $1.42 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +49.3%. EPS of $0.29 for the same period compares with -$1.21 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.25 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +13.5%. The EPS surprise was +261.11%.Over the last four quarters, Wynn surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Wynn is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Wynn. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

These totals would mark changes of +73.66% and -19.03%, respectively, from last year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for NRG Energy should also be noted by investors. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends.

PDCO is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its broad product line. The optimism led by a solid third-quarter fiscal 2023 performance and a few notable acquisitions are expected to contribute further. Integration risks and stiff competitive forces persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 4.2% against the 18% rise of the industry and the S&amp;P 500’s 15.5% growth.The renowned global dental and animal health company has a market capitalization of $2.65 billion. The company projects 7.2% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. Patterson Companies’ earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, delivering a surprise of 6.2%, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Broad Product Spectrum: We are optimistic about Patterson Companies’ wide range of consumable supplies, equipment and software, and value-added services. A notable offering from the company is a private-label brand named Pivotal, while it continues adding stock keeping units to its broader private-label portfolio. Patterson Companies’ NaVetor is an integrated cloud-based veterinary practice management software for its Animal Health segment.Acquisitions: We are upbeat about Patterson Companies’ strategy of expanding its business via strategic acquisitions. In January, it announced that it had, through subsidiaries, completed the previously-announced acquisition of substantially all the assets of Relief Services for Veterinary Practitioners and Animal Care Technologies.In December 2022, Patterson Companies announced that it had, through a subsidiary, closed the previously announced acquisition of substantially all the assets of Dairy Tech, Inc.Strong Q3 Results: Patterson Companies’ better-than-expected earnings in third-quarter fiscal 2023 results buoy optimism. Strength in the overall top line, Value-added Services and Other business of the Dental segment and the overall Animal Health segment was witnessed. The gross margin expansion bodes well for the company. Prudent cost-saving initiatives and solid sales execution continue to favor Patterson Companies.Story continuesDownsidesStiff Competition: The U.S. dental products distribution industry is highly competitive and consists chiefly of national, regional and local full-service and mail-order distributors. Patterson Companies needs to continue to introduce newer products in the market to withstand competitive pressures. Failure to do so can dilute the company’s market share.Integration Risks: Patterson Companies has been on an acquisition spree which is improving its revenue opportunities, but is aggravating integration risks. Regular acquisitions are also a distraction for management which is likely to impact organic growth. This may limit Patterson Companies’ future expansion and worsen the company’s risk profile, going forward.Estimate TrendPatterson Companies is witnessing a flat estimate revision trend for fiscal 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has remained stable at $2.28.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $1.66 billion, suggesting a 1.1% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

115,9ff0affc-f407-3afb-99a2-d9a2ac4b7482,BK,2023-06-16,The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 85% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bank-york-mellon-corporation-nyse-140136741.html,1686837696,STORY,['BK'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Bank of New York Mellon's stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsThe top 18 shareholders own 50% of the companyUsing data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a companyA look at the shareholders of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 85% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Bank of New York Mellon. See our latest analysis for Bank of New York Mellon ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Bank of New York Mellon?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Bank of New York Mellon does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Bank of New York Mellon, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Bank of New York Mellon. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.2%. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.4% and 7.6% of the stock.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 18 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Bank of New York MellonThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$51m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 15% stake in Bank of New York Mellon. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past. You can access this interactive graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow, for free.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financials over the long term, which in this case look pretty respectable. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Tyson Foods'  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. See our latest analysis for Tyson Foods How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Tyson Foods is:7.8% = US$1.5b ÷ US$20b (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.08.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.A Side By Side comparison of Tyson Foods' Earnings Growth And 7.8% ROEOn the face of it, Tyson Foods' ROE is not much to talk about. We then compared the company's ROE to the broader industry and were disappointed to see that the ROE is lower than the industry average of 14%. However, the moderate 5.3% net income growth seen by Tyson Foods over the past five years is definitely a positive. So, the growth in the company's earnings could probably have been caused by other variables. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Tyson Foods' net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 8.4% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is TSN fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Tyson Foods Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?With a three-year median payout ratio of 27% (implying that the company retains 73% of its profits), it seems that Tyson Foods is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees respectable amount growth in its earnings and pays a dividend that's well covered.Moreover, Tyson Foods is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 45% over the next three years. Regardless, the future ROE for Tyson Foods is speculated to rise to 11% despite the anticipated increase in the payout ratio. There could probably be other factors that could be driving the future growth in the ROE.ConclusionIn total, it does look like Tyson Foods has some positive aspects to its business. Namely, its respectable earnings growth, which it achieved due to it retaining most of its profits. However, given the low ROE, investors may not be benefitting from all that reinvestment after all. That being so, the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings.

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the source added.It will follow the official state dinner on June 22 at the White House with President Joe Biden - a celebration billed as a milestone in relations between the two democracies.Biden has been eager to strengthen ties with India as part of his bid to win what he has framed as a contest between free and autocratic societies, especially China.Modi is not likely to directly address the threat from China in public remarks, a second source said, but he is expected to raise the issue during private discussions.Decreasing India's dependence on Russia for its defense needs and increasing its own manufacturing capabilities will be among the top themes discussed between the two countries, the second source said.The Biden administration is pushing New Delhi to cut through its own red tape and advance a deal for dozens of U.S.-made armed drones, sources told Reuters.New Delhi has frustrated Washington by participating in military exercises with Russia and increasing purchases of the country's crude oil, a key source of funding for the war in Ukraine. Washington has been encouraging New Delhi to do more to punish Russia for the Ukraine invasion.U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, who recently visited India to make final preparations ahead of Modi's visit, said the United States is set to remove obstacles that prevent smoother trade with India in critical areas such as defense and high technology.Story continuesThe U.S. became India's largest trading partner in fiscal year 2022-23 as bilateral trade rose by almost 8% to $128.55 billion, according to data from India's Ministry of Commerce.

Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will offer associated engineering support for development of THAAD PAC-3 MSE component.Work related to this deal will be executed in Grand Prairie, TX.What’s Favoring Lockheed?Increasing geopolitical and socioeconomic turmoil worldwide has prompted nations, both developed and developing, to expand their respective military arsenal, with missiles constituting a significant portion of that inventory.Lockheed’s Missiles and Fire Control business unit develops, manufactures and supports advanced combat missiles and rockets for military customers, including the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, NASA and dozens of foreign allies. Some of its prominent products include the PAC-3 missile, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile, JASSM, LRASM and many more.In March 2022, Lockheed successfully integrated the THAAD Weapon System with PAC-3 MSE. This integration allows the PAC-3 MSE interceptor to launch earlier, thereby significantly expanding the MSE defended area.  Such developments increase the chances of Lockheed’s missiles being selected by Pentagon, with the U.S. administration steadily boosting the nation’s defense spending. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.Growth ProspectsThe global rocket and missiles market is projected to reach $82.0 billion by 2031.

To skip our detailed analysis of the defense sector, you can head directly to the Top 5 Defense Contractors in the World in 2023.Global military expenditure has grown by 19% since 2013 to reach a record high of $2,240 billion in 2022 – which accounts for 2.2% of the world’s gross domestic product (GDP). Much of last year’s defense spending was driven by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with Europe witnessing its steepest rise in the post-cold war era, with an increase of 13% compared to 2021. The Middle East experienced a growth of 3.2% on defense spending, as Saudi Arabia returned to the list of the world’s top five military spenders, having spent $75 billion that year. These staggering numbers were released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) in its 2022 report.Largest Defense ContractorsAccording to The Business Research Company, the global defense market has grown from $535 billion to $577 billion between 2022 and 2023 – a CAGR growth of 7.9%. The boom is likely to continue with the industry size expected to cross $700 billion by 2027. Some major beneficiaries of the surge in defense expenditures include companies like Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) whose operating profits increased by 9% between 2021 and 2022. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) was awarded contracts by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) worth $45.68 billion in 2022 – which made up for nearly 70% of its annual revenue.The China North Industries Group Corporation Limited, and the Aviation Industry Corporation of China, also known as AVIC, are also among the prime contractors that profited from the increased spending in the previous year. China is the world’s second biggest military spender after the United States, and much of its armaments are sourced from industries at home. In 2022, Beijing spent an estimated $292 billion on defense expenditure, according to SIPRI.Story continuesIn the United States, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) topped the charts as the largest federal defense contractor, having received over 11% of all spending by the DoD in 2022. This did not only include expenditure incurred on the U.S. military, but also contracts to aid the Ukrainian military against Russian advances. By December, the company had received missile orders worth $950 billion from Pentagon to refill stockpiles in Ukraine, with great focus on the production of HIMARS. These rocket launchers have proven instrumental in turning the tide in the conflict against Russia.Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) was followed by Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) at second spot, winning 6.1% of all defense-related contracts of the U.S. government. In September 2022, Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) was awarded a $985 million order from the U.S. Air Force to develop scramjet-powered hypersonic cruise missiles.The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is another top contractor for the U.S. Department of Defense. In 2022, it received total orders from the DoD worth over $14.7 billion, which included a $2.21 billion contract for its KC-46A Pegasus aircrafts. General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) claimed fourth and fifth positions, respectively, in the list of the top five defense contractors in the United States in terms of overall revenue in 2022. The US is also highly regarded for having the best defense industry in the world.Since the advent of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, priorities of the western world appear to have shifted from the global war on terror and now seem reminiscent of the Cold War era. Finland has joined NATO as its 31st member. Sweden has also applied for membership and is on the brink of receiving it. At least seven members are exceeding NATO’s defense expenditure goal of 2% of the GDP, with others taking urgent measures to increase their military spending and meet the target. You can read more about this in our article, NATO Military Spending by Country: Top 20 Countries.MethodologyWe have used two weighted metrics to rank the top 16 defense contractors in the world. These are 2022 annual revenues of firms that are in the defense industry, and the monetary value of the contracts they have received from the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) during 2022. 30% of weightage was assigned to annual revenue, while 70% to DoD contracts. The United States is the biggest military spender in the world and accounts for nearly 40% of all defense expenditure globally.It is also home to some of the largest aerospace and armaments manufacturing companies that meet modern military procurement needs of militaries around the world with new sophisticated weapons. Therefore, DoD contracts were assigned a greater weightage while creating this list than revenue volumes.For information on DoD contracts, we have used data from USASpending.gov. There was no public data available on Chinese defense companies' contracts with their own or foreign governments. They have been highlighted as biggest contractors based on reports that link them to the People's Liberation Army (PLA). We have used their revenues as a proxy for their contractual magnitude.Top 16 Defense Contractors in the World in 2023Everett Historical / shutterstock.comHere are the top 16 defense contractors in the world in 2023:16.

The latest contract is a bright example of that. These developments should boost the company’s top-line growth.Growth ProspectsNations have increased their spending on military equipment and various arsenals to strengthen their defense capabilities.

Following the results, the company’s shares rose 2.2% in an after-hours trading session on Jun 14.The housing market condition is normalizing and has been gaining from the pent-up demand condition, given the shortage of existing homes in the sector. The homebuilder has also lifted its deliveries expectation for the year.Pertaining to the prospect, Stuart Miller, executive chairman of Lennar, said, “As consumers have come to accept a ""new normal"" range for interest rates, demand has accelerated, leaving the market to reconcile the chronic supply shortage derived from over a decade of production deficits. Simply put, America needs more housing, particularly affordable workforce housing, and demand is strong when price and interest rates are affordable.""Quarterly NumbersLEN reported adjusted quarterly earnings (excluding mark-to-market losses on technology investments) of $2.94 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.32 per share by 26.7% but decreased 37.3% year over year.Lennar Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseLennar Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseLennar Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Lennar Corporation QuoteRevenues of $8.05 billion topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.27 billion by 10.5% but declined 3.8% year over year.Segment DetailsHomebuilding: Revenues of the segment totaled $7.67 billion, down 4% from the prior-year quarter. Under the Homebuilding umbrella, home sales contributed $7.6 billion to total revenues, down 4.1% from a year ago. The decrease was due to the lower average sales price of homes, partly offset by higher deliveries.On the other hand, Land sales accounted for $16.3 million, up from $7.5 million in the prior-year quarter. The Other homebuilding unit contributed $17.1 million to homebuilding revenues, up from $6.8 million a year ago.Home deliveries for the reported quarter improved 3% from the year-ago level to 17,074 units. The average sales price of homes delivered was $449,000, down 7% from the year-ago figure due to pricing-to-market and product mix.New orders rose 0.5% from the year-ago quarter to 17,885 homes. Backlog at the fiscal second-quarter end declined 29.3% from a year ago to 20,214 homes. Potential housing revenues from backlog decreased 35.1% year over year to $9.53 billion.The gross margin on home sales was 22.5% for the quarter, down 700 basis points (bps). The downside was due to lower revenues per square foot as LEN priced homes to market, while costs per square foot increased on higher materials and labor costs. Land costs also increased year over year.Selling, general and administrative or SG&amp;A expenses — as a percentage of home sales — increased 60 bps to 6.7% due to more use of brokers in current market conditions.Homebuilding’s operating earnings of $1.21 billion decreased from the year-ago level of $1.88 billion. Net margin as a percentage of home sales contracted 760 bps to 15.8%.Financial Services: The segment’s revenues increased year over year to $223 million from $200.2 million for the reported quarter. Operating earnings for the quarter rose to $112.6 million from $103.9 million a year ago.Lennar Multi-Family: Revenues of $151.7 million in the segment were down from $176 million in the prior-year quarter.

Homebuilding debt to capital at the fiscal first-quarter end was 13.3%, down from 14.4% at the fiscal 2022-end and 17.7% from a year-ago period.LEN has no outstanding borrowings under the $2.6 billion revolving credit facility, thereby providing $6.6 billion of liquidity.The company repurchased 2 million shares for $208 million at an average share price of $103.91 in the fiscal second quarter.GuidanceFor third-quarter fiscal 2023, the company expects deliveries within 17,750-18,250 homes with a gross margin on home sales of 23.5-24%. New orders are likely to be between 18,000 and 19,000 units, and the average selling price is expected to be similar to the fiscal second quarter.SG&amp;A expenses, as a percentage of home sales, are likely to be within 6.7-6.8% for the quarter. Financial Services’ operating earnings are expected to be in the range of $100-$105 million.For fiscal 2023, Lennar projects deliveries between 68,000 and 70,000 (versus 62,000 and 66,000 homes expected earlier).Zacks Rank &amp; Other Stocks to ConsiderLennar currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other top-ranked stocks in the Zacks Construction sector are:PulteGroup Inc.

For more stocks, head on over to 5 A-Rated Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On. The stock market is made up of thousands of companies. Combined with the fact that the regular, retail investor has an unprecedented amount of data available to them for making decisions, this makes investing appear to be a tedious task where one is always at the risk of either missing out on the next Apple or making a blunder based on missing out on a key piece of information.These apparent traps are compounded by the fact that these days the stock market is at continuous odds with what most people think will happen. The American conversation has been full of predictions of a recession after the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hike cycle made conducting business quite difficult. With the fear of a recession on the horizon, the stock market doesn't perform too well either. However, the market is doing just fine. Don't believe us? Well, the NASDAQ 100 index is up by 34% year to date, the S&amp;P 500 has gained 12%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has returned 1.8%, and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) still hasn't lost money.So this makes us wonder if listening to all the predictions of gloom and doom is really worth it. Well, they might be since the market these days is responding to sector specific trading signals. This is evident when we look at the NASDAQ's gains. The index, dominated by the technology sector, is seeing a recovery in the industry that was gutted in 2022. And the others, particularly the S&amp;P and the NYSE, which are a balanced bunch representing firms from all walks of lives, are wary of a broader softening environment in the wake of a year long battle with inflation and high interest rates.As if this weren't enough, there are some folks who believe that a recession might be a good thing for the stock market. Or at least that's what the chief executive officer of Destination Wealth Management Mr. Michael Yoshikami believes. In an interview with CNBC in late May, the head of the firm that enables the rich to manage their money shared his take on the current back and forth in the media about a recession. His thinking really isn't that complicated, and it involves understanding the actions of the Federal Reserve in case the economy does not cool down. Mr. Yoshikami believes that if this is the case then the Federal Reserve might not reduce the interest rates or could even hike them further. Given that stock market sentiment is actually a reflection of investors' estimates of what will happen in the future, a robust economy stands the risk of shaping investor sentiments towards further hikes and as a result making money flow out of the market and into safe haven assets, money market accounts, or bank savings accounts.Story continuesSpeaking of safe haven, the U.S. dollar has been long considered the asset of choice for risk aversion fueled by the fact that the U.S. government is unlikely to fail its debt obligations. While the U.S. might not fail anytime soon as both Congress and Senate just passed another extension of the debt ceiling, the current macroeconomic environment might not bode well for the Treasury this time around. At least that's what is on the mind of Otavio Costa, Portfolio Manager at Crescat Capital. In a recent Twitter thread, he shared that after the debt deal, Treasury is likely to issue debt fast, but as opposed to previous issues, this time around it might not find willing buyers. According to Mr. Costa, foreign investors will consider the effects of these securities on existing debt held by banks and the risk of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates. Higher rates reduce the price of current bonds and the risk of future interest rate hikes makes investors wary of buying more debt due to this fact. The soft treasuries market also reduces the appetite for U.S. bonds for central banks, and according to the portfolio manager, if central banks consider making gold account for 40% of their reserves, they could inject as much as $32 trillion into the gold market to cause the price to shoot by a whopping 25%.So is gold primed to shine and should you bid farewell to the stock market? Well, Ken Fisher of Fisher Investments believes that gold is quite volatile, explaining that:There's nothing wrong with gold. It's a commodity, it's volatile. The fact is sometime people think of it this way, sometimes they think of it that way. Lately they've been thinking maybe it's an inflation hedge. Mind you, over all those decades I just talked to you about, there was always inflation. You follow that? And it didn't hedge that inflation very well. Number two, what can we say about it in the very long term? That it has a return that's positive, a little bit lower long term average than, let's say, long term U.S. Treasury Bonds. With a higher volatility then bonds. That doesn't shock you very much. Because bonds are expected to have fairly low volatility. Mind you on the other hand over those same time periods, very long time period, it has about the half the return of stocks, with an actually markedly higher volatility than stocks. That's the point that surprises people. Lower return, higher volatility. Gold gets about 80% of its, maybe 85% of its long term total return from about 15% of time periods. Whereas stock thrives about two thirds of the time period, bond thrives a little more than that. If you can predict gold, you need no advice from me whatsoever.Mic. Drop. So, it's not gold, it's not bonds, but it's stocks. To make your journey easier, we took a look at some A-rated stocks and decided to see which have received the blessings of billionaires.

132,e645cc85-ff3c-3df7-8c4d-c0fa96f0233c,MRK,2023-06-16,KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Plus Trastuzumab and Chemotherapy Met Primary Endpoint of Progression-Free Survival as First-Line Treatment in Patients With HER2-Positive Advanced Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction (GEJ) Adenocarcinoma,Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/keytruda-pembrolizumab-plus-trastuzumab-chemotherapy-104500782.html,1686912300,STORY,['MRK'],"[Based on a subgroup analysis by PD-L1 expression from KEYNOTE-811, Merck is working with the US FDA to update the current indication for KEYTRUDA in HER2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinomaRAHWAY, N.J., June 16, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, today announced that the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-811 trial investigating KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy met one of its dual primary endpoints of progression-free survival (PFS) for the first-line treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma. At a pre-specified interim analysis conducted by an independent Data Monitoring Committee, KEYTRUDA in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS compared to placebo in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy in the intention-to-treat (ITT) study population.Based on a pre-specified subgroup analysis by PD-L1 expression, the improvement in PFS observed in the ITT population was limited to patients whose tumors were PD-L1 positive (Combined Positive Score [CPS] ≥1). In the study, more than 80% of patients had tumors that were PD-L1 positive. Merck has discussed these findings with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is working with the FDA to update the current indication for KEYTRUDA in HER2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma to those patients whose tumors are PD-L1 positive. In addition, these results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and shared with regulatory authorities worldwide.In May 2021, KEYTRUDA was approved in combination with trastuzumab, fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-containing chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma in the U.S. This indication was approved by the FDA under accelerated approval based on objective response rate (ORR) data from KEYNOTE-811, and continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials.Story continuesA trend toward improvement in overall survival (OS), the trial’s other primary endpoint, was observed in the ITT population for patients who received the KEYTRUDA combination versus placebo in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy; however, these results did not meet statistical significance per the pre-specified statistical analysis plan. Overall survival will be tested at a subsequent analysis. The safety profile of KEYTRUDA was consistent with that observed in previously reported studies.""These new data from KEYNOTE-811, demonstrating a significant improvement in progression-free survival, are meaningful and build on the earlier insights from this study that supported the accelerated approval of this KEYTRUDA combination in the U.S. for certain patients with HER2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma,"" said Dr. Scot Ebbinghaus, vice president, global clinical development, Merck Research Laboratories. ""We look forward to sharing these results with the medical community and regulatory authorities to ensure this KEYTRUDA-based regimen is available to appropriate patients, and we are working with the FDA to update the current indication for KEYTRUDA to those patients whose tumors are PD-L1 positive.""Merck has an extensive clinical development program evaluating KEYTRUDA in gastrointestinal cancers and is continuing to study KEYTRUDA for multiple uses in gastric, hepatobiliary, esophageal, pancreatic and colorectal cancers.About KEYNOTE-811KEYNOTE-811 is a randomized, double-blind Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03615326) evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma. The dual primary endpoints are PFS per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by blinded independent central review and OS. Secondary endpoints include ORR, duration of response and safety. The trial enrolled an estimated 732 patients who were randomized to receive KEYTRUDA (200 mg every three weeks) in combination with trastuzumab, fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-containing chemotherapy (investigator’s choice of 5-fluorouracil plus cisplatin or capecitabine plus oxaliplatin), or placebo in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy.About gastric cancerGastric (stomach) cancer tends to develop slowly over many years and rarely causes early symptoms, resulting in most cases going undetected until an advanced stage. More than 70% of patients with gastric cancer develop advanced-stage disease. Most gastric cancers are adenocarcinomas (about 90-95%), which develop from cells in the innermost lining of the stomach (known as the mucosa). Gastric cancer is the fifth most diagnosed cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer death worldwide, with approximately 1.1 million patients diagnosed and 768,000 patient deaths from the disease globally in 2020. In the U.S., it is estimated there will be approximately 26,500 patients diagnosed with gastric cancer and 11,000 patient deaths from the disease in 2023. The five-year survival rate for patients diagnosed with gastric cancer at an advanced stage is only 6%.About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mgKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD- L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.Selected KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.Gastric CancerKEYTRUDA, in combination with trastuzumab, fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-containing chemotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma.This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials.See additional selected KEYTRUDA indications in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety Information.Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDASevere and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.Immune-Mediated PneumonitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.Pneumonitis occurred in 7% (41/580) of adult patients with resected NSCLC who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent for adjuvant treatment of NSCLC, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 26 (4.5%) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 54% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 63% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 71% had resolution.Immune-Mediated ColitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients.Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated HepatitisKEYTRUDA as a Single AgentKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients.KEYTRUDA With AxitinibKEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT ≥3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT ≥3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT ≥3 ULN subsequently recovered from the event.Immune-Mediated EndocrinopathiesAdrenal InsufficiencyKEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 77% (17/22) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.3% (8) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.HypophysitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism. Initiate hormone replacement as indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.2%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 94% (16/17) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Hypophysitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (4) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.Thyroid DisordersKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism.

Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; Ocular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection.Infusion-Related ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA.

For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple MyelomaIn trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.Embryofetal ToxicityBased on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.Adverse ReactionsIn KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%).

The award has been offered by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL.Details of the DealValued at $50 million, the contract is projected to be completed by Dec 31, 2025. Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will offer associated engineering support for development of THAAD PAC-3 MSE component.Work related to this deal will be executed in Grand Prairie, TX.What’s Favoring Lockheed?Increasing geopolitical and socioeconomic turmoil worldwide has prompted nations, both developed and developing, to expand their respective military arsenal, with missiles constituting a significant portion of that inventory.Lockheed’s Missiles and Fire Control business unit develops, manufactures and supports advanced combat missiles and rockets for military customers, including the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, NASA and dozens of foreign allies. Some of its prominent products include the PAC-3 missile, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile, JASSM, LRASM and many more.In March 2022, Lockheed successfully integrated the THAAD Weapon System with PAC-3 MSE. This integration allows the PAC-3 MSE interceptor to launch earlier, thereby significantly expanding the MSE defended area.  Such developments increase the chances of Lockheed’s missiles being selected by Pentagon, with the U.S. administration steadily boosting the nation’s defense spending. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.Growth ProspectsThe global rocket and missiles market is projected to reach $82.0 billion by 2031. It is also anticipated to witness a CAGR of 4.2% during 2022-2031, per a report by Allied Market Research firm.Such projections reflect increased growth opportunities for major missile players like Lockheed, Raytheon RTX, Northrop Grumman NOC and Boeing BA in the aforementioned market.Story continuesNotably, Raytheon offers a variety of combat-proven missile defense systems, including the Patriot missile, Standard Missile-6, Standard Missile-3, Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile, Evolved Seasparrow Missile, Tomahawk cruise missile and a few more.Raytheon boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.3%.

To skip our detailed analysis of the defense sector, you can head directly to the Top 5 Defense Contractors in the World in 2023.Global military expenditure has grown by 19% since 2013 to reach a record high of $2,240 billion in 2022 – which accounts for 2.2% of the world’s gross domestic product (GDP). Much of last year’s defense spending was driven by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with Europe witnessing its steepest rise in the post-cold war era, with an increase of 13% compared to 2021. The Middle East experienced a growth of 3.2% on defense spending, as Saudi Arabia returned to the list of the world’s top five military spenders, having spent $75 billion that year. These staggering numbers were released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) in its 2022 report.Largest Defense ContractorsAccording to The Business Research Company, the global defense market has grown from $535 billion to $577 billion between 2022 and 2023 – a CAGR growth of 7.9%. The boom is likely to continue with the industry size expected to cross $700 billion by 2027. Some major beneficiaries of the surge in defense expenditures include companies like Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) whose operating profits increased by 9% between 2021 and 2022. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) was awarded contracts by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) worth $45.68 billion in 2022 – which made up for nearly 70% of its annual revenue.The China North Industries Group Corporation Limited, and the Aviation Industry Corporation of China, also known as AVIC, are also among the prime contractors that profited from the increased spending in the previous year. China is the world’s second biggest military spender after the United States, and much of its armaments are sourced from industries at home. In 2022, Beijing spent an estimated $292 billion on defense expenditure, according to SIPRI.Story continuesIn the United States, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) topped the charts as the largest federal defense contractor, having received over 11% of all spending by the DoD in 2022. This did not only include expenditure incurred on the U.S. military, but also contracts to aid the Ukrainian military against Russian advances. By December, the company had received missile orders worth $950 billion from Pentagon to refill stockpiles in Ukraine, with great focus on the production of HIMARS. These rocket launchers have proven instrumental in turning the tide in the conflict against Russia.Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) was followed by Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) at second spot, winning 6.1% of all defense-related contracts of the U.S. government. In September 2022, Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) was awarded a $985 million order from the U.S. Air Force to develop scramjet-powered hypersonic cruise missiles.The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is another top contractor for the U.S. Department of Defense. In 2022, it received total orders from the DoD worth over $14.7 billion, which included a $2.21 billion contract for its KC-46A Pegasus aircrafts. General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) claimed fourth and fifth positions, respectively, in the list of the top five defense contractors in the United States in terms of overall revenue in 2022. The US is also highly regarded for having the best defense industry in the world.Since the advent of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, priorities of the western world appear to have shifted from the global war on terror and now seem reminiscent of the Cold War era. Finland has joined NATO as its 31st member. Sweden has also applied for membership and is on the brink of receiving it. At least seven members are exceeding NATO’s defense expenditure goal of 2% of the GDP, with others taking urgent measures to increase their military spending and meet the target. You can read more about this in our article, NATO Military Spending by Country: Top 20 Countries.MethodologyWe have used two weighted metrics to rank the top 16 defense contractors in the world. These are 2022 annual revenues of firms that are in the defense industry, and the monetary value of the contracts they have received from the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) during 2022. 30% of weightage was assigned to annual revenue, while 70% to DoD contracts. The United States is the biggest military spender in the world and accounts for nearly 40% of all defense expenditure globally.It is also home to some of the largest aerospace and armaments manufacturing companies that meet modern military procurement needs of militaries around the world with new sophisticated weapons. Therefore, DoD contracts were assigned a greater weightage while creating this list than revenue volumes.For information on DoD contracts, we have used data from USASpending.gov. There was no public data available on Chinese defense companies' contracts with their own or foreign governments. They have been highlighted as biggest contractors based on reports that link them to the People's Liberation Army (PLA). We have used their revenues as a proxy for their contractual magnitude.Top 16 Defense Contractors in the World in 2023Everett Historical / shutterstock.comHere are the top 16 defense contractors in the world in 2023:16.

A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings.The Kroger Company assumes no obligation to update that information. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question, if necessary. I will now turn the call over to Rodney.Story continuesWilliam Rodney McMullenThank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're off to a great start in 2023 with results that reflect the strength of our go-to-market strategy. Kroger is continuing to navigate a challenged environment, as our customers manage the effects of high inflation, fewer SNAP dollars and macroeconomic uncertainty. Despite these conditions, customers continue to prioritize their spending on food and our value proposition is resonating.The investments and productivity improvements we made over recent years, have strengthened our business, allowing us to sustainably invest in price for our customers while maintaining margins. By delivering great value and driving strategic initiatives, we are sustaining momentum, which gives us the confidence that we will continue delivering on our commitments.Many of our customer preferences and trends that emerged last year have, as expected, accelerated into the first quarter. Customers are actively looking for ways to save, and we are focused on providing a fresh and affordable shopping experience with zero compromise on quality, selection or convenience. As we've seen over recent quarters, our customers are saving through loyalty discounts, including weekly specials and yellow tag promotions, engaging in our broad assortment of Our Brands products and redeeming personalized digital coupons and fuel rewards.During the first quarter, sales made on promotion increased approximately 380 basis points, and digital coupon redemptions increased to [180 million]. We are delivering more savings opportunities, including working with our suppliers to fund more promotions. Kroger's value proposition offers something for every customer, which I'm pleased to say led to increased customer trips and our eighth consecutive quarter of household growth. That being said, we continue to see a split in spend across customer segments. The economic environment is more significantly impacting our budget-conscious shoppers, while our mainstream and higher income shoppers are increasing their spend with us and deepening their loyalty.We grew mainstream households, which make up the largest segment of our customer base. We also grew our higher-income customer households, as they migrate from specialty retailers to Kroger. These customers are extremely valuable because they are building larger baskets and spending more per item. We see these customers buying premium Our Brands lines, more fresh items and larger pack size, and as a result, they are more profitable. In contrast, our budget-conscious households are buying fewer items, particularly as SNAP benefits, declined during the quarter. In some cases, we see these households switching to lower-priced products and smaller pack sizes. The least loyal customer in this group are clearly prioritizing the price at shelf, over other factors such as personalized offers, convenience and quality.While no one can predict the macroeconomic outlook with certainty, we expect customers, particularly those on tighter budgets, will continue to feel the effects of inflation and higher interest rates. We have started to see relief as year-over-year inflation levels moderate, particularly in fresh categories. We expect value and quality to remain in focus for the majority of our customers in the months ahead. Our attractive value proposition positions us well for this environment. In fact, our promotional pricing, personalized offers and fuel savings work together to create an overall value comparable to everyday low-price providers, and those savings come with much more personalized experience.Along with our great value proposition, we will continue investing in and growing our strategic priorities of Fresh, Our Brands, Personalization and Seamless to create a full fresh and friendly customer experience. As you know, we lead with Fresh. Our Fresh for Everyone promise connects strongly with customers, and is a key differentiator that drives customers to us. We are constantly innovating by applying data and technology to improve the customer's Fresh experience.A key to winning in Fresh is our supply chain. We improved our supply chain's efficiency through investments in talent and technology, as well as controlling more movement of products across our network. As a result, our associates improved our in-stock rates, which drive higher sales. Through our end-to-end Fresh initiative, we are streamlining our supply chain to minimize the lapsed time from farm to shelf. Combined with our convenient store network, these investments deliver even more days of freshness at home for our customers. Together, these improvements also reduce our expenses, allowing us to invest in price for customers, while providing fresher choices and more options.Turning to Our Brands. Our Brands delivered another solid quarter that led by our namesake, Kroger Brand, a national brand equivalent. Our Brands are always a winner with our customers. In this period of sustained high inflation, it helps our customers save money without sacrificing quality. While inflation may have been the reason for some customers trying Our Brands products, the taste and quality makes the customer love these products and continue to repurchase them.For customers looking for more convenience, Home Chef plays an important role and continues to innovate and expand offerings to meet growing customer needs. This quarter, Home Chef expanded its menu to bring more healthy choices, premium meals and new concepts. Our team unveiled its first dedicated family menu designed to make family dinners, easier than ever. The menu includes easy-to-prepare recipes for larger groups with meals appealing to both adults and children and at an attractive value.Next is Personalization. For years, Kroger has been at the forefront of using data and analytics, including artificial intelligence to build a better customer and associate experience. By applying our data and AI-based personalization, we can better understand what truly matters to our customers and deliver more targeted and effective experiences. As customers' digital engagement increases, we have new and more efficient channels to present the most relevant products and the right promotions at the right times, no matter where and how customers choose to shop with us.As AI advances, we continue to work and constantly evaluate potential use cases throughout the business with privacy and responsible implementation in mind. For customers, we see opportunities to further simplify the digital experience and offer more accurate personalized recommendations. Our teams are working with search algorithms and generative AI to improve substitution accuracy and search results. Within our 84.51° customer research team, we are already piloting several large language models to summarize customer database sets. By applying AI to customer surveys and customer service logs, our team can analyze and categorize them in minutes versus days before. This allows the business to react to customer feedback more quickly and accurately, and then reflect these learnings in the customer experience.For our associates, we envision ways to further simplify work through advanced algorithms that optimize activities such as store orders. These, in turn, help reduce out-of-stocks, improve inventory management and reduce expenses. Data is in our DNA. Our rich history as a technology leader gives us confidence that we will continue to effectively use AI, including more recent innovations. We also believe robust, accurate and diverse first-party data is critical to maximizing the impact of innovation in data science and AI. As a result, Kroger is well positioned to successfully adopt these innovations and deliver a better customer and associate experience.Now on Seamless. Growth in both our pickup and delivery businesses led to a strong quarter of digital sales growth. A significant rise in both households and transactions fueled this growth. Pickup remains an important part of our Seamless ecosystem. During the quarter, our team's focus on associate training resulted in improvements in the customer experience. Pickup Net Promoter Scores increased, as we improved fill rates and reduced customer wait times, obviously something we're very proud of.Seamless starts with our digital experience, which we built to be simple, convenient regardless of how customers choose to shop with us. Whether our customers want immediacy of Kroger Delivery Now or to place a large stock-up order through our customer fulfillment centers, the customer experience is the same. This shifts complexity from our customers to Kroger. Even customers shopping only in store are beginning their shopping trip through our mobile app or website by clipping coupons and creating shopping lists curated for their store. These growing interactions contributed to the 13% increase, in digitally engaged households this quarter. We value this behavior as digitally engaged households are more loyal, spend nearly 3x more with us, and help grow our alternative profit businesses like Kroger Precision Marketing.Our associates continue to provide our customers with an outstanding full, fresh and friendly experience, better continuity on our teams and more engaged associates lead to a more consistent customer experience. And we are excited about the continued improvement in retention. This improvement reflects our focus on making Kroger a place, where associates can come for a job and discover a career. Kroger is committed to training our future leaders and made significant investments this quarter. We enhanced our career development framework, expanded our leadership development course catalog and introduced company-wide development days. In the first quarter alone, our leaders engaged in more than 445,000 leadership development courses to strengthen their skills. We are excited for our associates' commitment to developing their careers with Kroger.Our associates are driven by our purpose to feed the human spirit, and Kroger's effort to build healthy communities are being recognized. This quarter, Kroger was selected as a 2023 SEAL Business Sustainability Awards winner in the environmental initiative category. We received this award in recognition for our progress in creating communities free from hunger and waste, which is a result of our team's collective efforts to more deeply integrate Zero Hunger | Zero Waste in our operations. We are incredibly appreciative of all of these efforts.In closing, Kroger delivered a strong first quarter, by focusing on delivering customers value through our Seamless ecosystem. We are growing customer households and trips, and our business remains well positioned for the environment ahead. With that, I'll turn it over to Gary to take you through our financial results. Gary?Gary MillerchipThank you, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger's first quarter results clearly demonstrate the durability of our business in a more challenged operating environment. The investments we have made in our value creation model over recent years are paying off, allowing us to continue to deliver value for customers, invest in our associates and create attractive returns for our shareholders.As Rodney shared earlier, we are driving increased customer engagement through our go-to-market strategy, which in turn is fueling our flywheel, including growth in alternative profit businesses. I'll now walk through how our execution of this strategy translated into solid first quarter results. Identical sales without fuel is a key component of our growth model. During the quarter, we achieved identical sales without fuel of 3.5%. Underlying growth would have been 5%, after adjusting for the effect of the previously communicated decision to terminate our agreement with Express Scripts.As expected, the terminated agreement also had a positive effect on our FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, and a negative effect on the OG&amp;A rate, excluding fuel and adjustment items. The overall effect on operating profit during the first quarter was slightly positive, and we would expect this to continue to be the case for the remainder of 2023. Our decision to terminate the agreement with Express Scripts reflects our commitment to making decisions that we believe are in the long-term best interest of our customers and shareholders.Turning back to our identical sales without fuel growth in the quarter. These results were underpinned by key elements of our go-to-market strategy. Our Brands sales grew 4.9%. Our Brands continue to be an important source of savings for our customers, who are attracted to the unmatched quality and value they provide. At the same time, Our Brands helped drive stronger profitability, typically providing 600 to 800 basis points higher margin compared to national brands. Our merchandising team is doing an excellent job optimizing our portfolio of brands to drive improved penetration and margin performance.The launch of our new opening price point brand, Smart Way, has enhanced overall brand architecture, and our relentless focus on continuous improvement and innovation is driving strong momentum across the portfolio. We expect this momentum will continue to deliver value for the remainder of 2023.Digital sales grew 15% in the quarter. We saw 11% growth in pickup and 30% growth in delivery solutions, powered by our unique combination of CFCs and convenience store locations. Our Net Promoter Scores continue to increase and CFC volumes are growing in line with expectations in 2023. We are working closely with Ocado to make our CFCs even more efficient and productive. As a result of these joint efforts, our Monroe facility greatly improved the cost per order over the past quarter, and we're now in the process of applying these learnings across our other sites.As outlined at our business update back in March, we believe digital will continue to be an important growth driver and anticipate double-digit sales increases will continue for the remainder of 2023. Gross margin was 22.3% of sales. Our FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, increased 21 basis points compared to the same quarter, last year. Importantly, this increase in rate was achieved while also investing in price to maintain a competitive price position and deliver greater value for our customers.The improvement was primarily attributable to strong Our Brands performance, sourcing benefits, lower supply chain costs and the effect of our terminated agreement with Express Scripts, partially offset by higher shrink and increased promotional price investments. As we've shared previously, our strategy to improve margin over time has many components, including utilizing technology to increase supply chain efficiency, improving fresh capabilities, expansion of Our Brands, improvements in digital profitability and growth in retail media.The investments we have made over recent years to strengthen our business in these areas were reflected in our FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, this quarter. And we expect this trend to continue for the remainder of 2023. During the quarter, we recorded a LIFO charge of $99 million compared to a LIFO charge of $93 million for the same period last year. Kroger's OG&amp;A rate increased 14 basis points, excluding fuel and adjustment items, reflecting planned investments in associates and the effect of our terminated agreement with Express Scripts, partially offset by sales leverage and continued execution of cost saving initiatives.Associate investments are funded by removing costs from our business that do not impact the customer experience. This is an essential element of our go-to-market strategy, and we are on track to achieve our sixth consecutive year of $1 billion in annual cost savings. Adjusted FIFO operating profit in quarter 1 was $1,669 billion and our adjusted EPS was $1.51. Both measures were up 4% compared to the same period last year.I'll now walk through how the other key components of our value creation model contributed in the quarter and support our plans to deliver sustainable growth in the future. Our health and wellness team delivered results ahead of internal expectations during the quarter, including positive ID sales growth despite the effect of the termination of our agreement with Express Scripts. This performance was led by strong underlying results in our retail pharmacy business.Fuel is another important part of our strategy that drives customer loyalty, and was a tailwind to profitability in quarter 1. Fuel reward engagement remained high this quarter with a 19% increase in discounts redeemed, compared to the first quarter last year. The average retail fuel price was $3.55 this quarter compared to $4 in the same quarter last year. And our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.45 this quarter versus $0.42 in the same quarter last year.Turning now to alternative profit businesses. The significant traffic and data created by our food, health and fuel businesses continue to enable strong growth in alternative profits. Retail media is leading the way. And this quarter, KPM announced a new collaboration with Disney to bring its renowned targeting and measurement capabilities to Disney's portfolio of connected TV. Connected TV is one of the fastest-growing areas of ad spend, tripling in the last 3 years to $20 billion and is expected to double again by 2027. We are excited about the opportunities to accelerate KPM's future growth through this recent addition to the KPM ecosystem.KPM is also innovating in other areas, including in-store digital marketing. We recently announced a rollout of cooler screens in our stores. These innovative screens will replace traditional refrigerator and freezer doors with a digital overlay that will offer customers information on products, as well as KPM curated advertisements. This will bring a differentiated shopping experience to our customers while also creating another powerful marketing tool for KPM to offer to our brand partners.Our first quarter results would not have been possible without our incredible associates, who are doing an outstanding job executing our strategy and delivering a great customer experience. Our go-to-market strategy is underpinned by our commitment to continue investing in our associates to ensure Kroger remains an employer of choice. During the first quarter, we ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW for associates in Atlanta, Louisville and Cincinnati divisions, covering more than 51,000 associates. We also ratified a new agreement with the United Industrial Workers for our Columbus distribution center. We continue to negotiate contracts with the UFCW for associates in Smith's, Utah Clarks and Meat, Dallas Clarks, Dallas Meat and Fries division.Turning now to liquidity and free cash flow. Kroger continues to generate strong free cash flow. Our operating results, combined with improvements in inventory and receivables led to a reduction in net debt of $1.5 billion compared to Q1 last year. As a result of improvements in working capital, we now expect adjusted free cash flow to be in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion for the fiscal year 2023. At the end of the first quarter, Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was a record low of 1.34. This compares to our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA target ratio range of 2.30 to 2.50.The company expects to continue to pay its quarterly dividend and expect this to increase over time, subject to Board approval. As a reminder, we have paused our share repurchase program to prioritize deleveraging, following the proposed merger with Albertsons. In closing, I'd like to share some additional color on our outlook for the remainder of the year. As Rodney mentioned earlier, inflation started to show signs of deceleration throughout the quarter, particularly in the Fresh categories and ended the quarter approximately 400 basis points lower than the start of the year. We expect inflation will continue to decline, as the year progresses and believe the environment will remain challenged for our customers as they deal with higher interest rates and an uncertain economic outlook.These were factors we anticipated, when we issued our original guidance, and the investments we have made over recent years to strengthen our value creation flywheel, give us the confidence to reaffirm our full year guidance for identical sales without fuel and adjusted EPS. Looking towards the balance of the year, we would expect identical sales without fuel to be at the low end of our guidance range of 1% to 2% for the remaining 3 quarters of 2023, reflecting continued slowing inflation, partially offset by underlying improvement in unit growth.Recall this guidance includes the effect of Express Scripts, which is a headwind to identical sales without fuel of approximately 150 basis points. We expect adjusted EPS to grow within our full year guidance range of 2% to 5% in each of the remaining quarters, excluding an expected 15% benefit from the 53rd week in the fourth quarter. We would expect Q2 adjusted EPS to be at the low end of our guidance range, as we cycle unusually high fuel margins for the same quarter last year.As you've heard from Rodney and myself this morning, Kroger is operating from a position of strength. While they remain macro uncertainties that could affect our operating environment across the remainder of 2023, we believe we have the right strategy and the flexible business model that continues to generate strong free cash flow. This will allow us to continue to deliver value for our customers, invest in our associates, and create attractive returns for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call back to Rodney.William Rodney McMullenThanks, Gary. Before we open the floor to your questions, let me provide a brief update on our pending merger with Albertsons Companies. Integration planning has progressed nicely and I'm energized by the people and talent across both the Albertsons and Kroger teams. I'm even more confident in the opportunities ahead, as we accelerate our strategy and deliver more value for our associates, customers, communities and shareholders. We remain on track and continue to expect the transaction to close in early 2024.We are working cooperatively with the regulators and at the same time, to identify potential buyers for the stores, we expect to divest to obtain clearance for the transaction. We will find well-capitalized buyers with experienced management teams that will maintain competitiveness. We are very pleased with the level of interest received thus far, and we'll work towards finding a solution that benefits all stakeholders.We continue to engage with various stakeholders in addition to the regulators and are actively working to address inaccuracies and misrepresentations about the merger. We made a commitment, on the day we announced the deal that this merger is about growth and that we will not lay off any frontline work associates, as a result of this merger. We are also committed to not closing any stores, distribution centers or manufacturing facilities as a result of the merger. We are very proud of our ability to make such a commitment, especially at a time when many companies are announcing job cuts. And this is consistent with Kroger's track record in recent mergers.We remain incredibly excited about our future together with Albertsons. We are confident that as many of our stakeholders learn about Kroger's history of growth through mergers, they will understand the meaningful and measurable benefits this will have for our customers, associates and communities.We are proud of the results our team delivered, while navigating a challenged environment. We are focused on delivering lower prices and more choices to our customers than ever before. Our value proposition is growing households and customer trips, which positions us well for long-term growth. We are confident that we have the right strategy. The strength of our value creation model positions us well to continue investing in our business, our customers and our associates, which powers our ability to deliver attractive returns for our shareholders. With that, Gary and I look forward to taking your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question for today comes from Chuck Cerankosky from Northcoast Research.Charles Edward CerankoskyNice quarter. You mentioned the increased amount of promotional activity that Kroger was in during the quarter. To what degree are the CPGs involved in that? And how much of the -- how much of it is Kroger spending its own, call it, gross profit dollars to promote your own brands?William Rodney McMullenThey are extremely engaged in that process. Obviously, we're targeting those based on each individual household and what's important to that household. If you look at items that are national brand items, it would be heavily financed by CPGs. We would see CPGs as supply chains have gotten much fuller products are starting to flow. We have started seeing CPGs more starting to worry about tonnage and supporting that. Obviously, with targeted promotions on our products, those are funded out of -- by Kroger, and it would be a pure economics in terms of the increase in tonnage in the investments we're making.But overall, it's -- we're pleased because it's helping people that's on a budget be able to stretch their money further, which is helpful. And we're able to do that at the same time while managing our margins as well.Charles Edward CerankoskyAnd Rodney, when you go back to that 30% increase in delivered digital orders, could you put a dollar amount on that? And how much of that 30% is coming out of the Ocado-related CFCs and spokes?William Rodney McMullenThe majority would be coming through their sheds. In terms of dollar numbers, I don't remember the specifics. I know the total overall, but I don't know the specifics. But the majority of that would be driven by the sheds. And as Gary mentioned, Ocado has -- we have a great partnership with Ocado and we're making good progress, especially on Monroe on ramping that facility up. And now we're in the process of rolling those learnings out to the other sheds. Gary, anything you want to add?Gary MillerchipAll I would add, Chuck, is that as you may recall, we announced a couple of years ago that our digital business reached $10 billion in total sales. So, when you think about the 15% growth, it would be growth on 1 quarter of a number north of $10 billion.OperatorOur next question comes from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley.Simeon Ari GutmanMy first question is also on the price investments and promotions. So this isn't the first quarter you've talked about making price investments. It seems like it stepped up a bit. The tone is a little more elevated. Is that right? And it seems like that's in response to the competitive environment. I'm curious if it's something sustainable. You're seeing this as a one-time. How should we read this? And is this -- or is this a permanent change that you think will be persistent for the time being?William Rodney McMullenI would read it a little different than the way you asked the questions, Simeon. If you look, it's really broad-based, but it's -- we continue to get better on using our own algorithms and AI to make sure that we're offering promotions that are most attractive to customers by household. So, some of that increased engagement is being able to do a better job targeting. As I mentioned to Chuck on the CPGs, a significant portion of that is funded by CPGs, which we think it's good for our customers and obviously good for tonnage over time.In terms of talking about it more, I would say it's more in terms of trying to share what's really going on behind the numbers to the best of our ability. So, I wouldn't say that we're talking about it more. I would completely agree that more customers are engaging in those promotions than before. And some of that is because of the economic environment. Some of it is because of the targeting algorithm.Gary MillerchipI think maybe, it ties a little bit as well to Rodney's comment earlier around different customer segments and how they're changing behavior in the current environment. Simeon, we mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks, we're seeing the mainstream customer and then the higher-income customer, in many cases, they're engaging more in Fresh products, engaging more in brands like Private Selection. We saw Private Selection outperform our overall sales growth during the quarter.So, there are certain customers that were certainly using our personalization to target to drive greater loyalty, greater engagement. And then, that customer that we clearly see is on a very constrained budget and have been impacted by the lower number of SNAP dollars in the market. Really focusing our marketing effort to ensure that we're personalizing offers to resonate with those customers and help them manage their budgets more effectively.Simeon Ari GutmanAnd maybe a related follow-up. We're talking about how inflation is pressuring the wallet. You mentioned that we're seeing some price come down. You mentioned fresh food in some places. I mean, at what point -- first, what is the elasticity? Are you seeing any pickup in volume in prices or in categories in which prices are going down? Or is it just too much weight on the consumer wallet, right now? And at what point do you expect that intersection when inflation comes down enough, you'll start to see a pick back up in unit or even trading back up?William Rodney McMullenIf you look historically, the context that you mentioned, as inflation gets lower, you do see tonnage increases. We would expect, as you look over the balance of the year, that would be -- would happen again. I would say, we're too early in the process to really be able to say specifically. We are seeing trend improvements in market share in some of those aspects and very good share gain in mainstream and less price-sensitive shoppers. So, it really is a bifurcation where certain customers are behaving, as if the way the economy has always been.The customers that are on a budget under SNAP, there's a significant reduction in SNAP dollars in the marketplace. And they are making significant modifications including before, maybe buying something that was a unit of 12, and now they'll buy a unit of 4. They're going more frequent but buying less each trip and things like that. So we would expect, as you look over the balance of the year, tonnage would improve, as inflation continues to decline on a year-on-year basis.But, I always think it's important to remember that inflation is cycling high inflation, which usually causes inflation increases to be less moderate. And as we look out to the balance of the year, we would still expect to have inflation. It's just less than what it's been in the last couple of years or 1.5 years.OperatorOur next question comes from Michael Lasser of UBS.Michael LasserGiven your updated expectation for IDs to be at the lower end of your full year comp guidance, does that imply that you do expect IDs to be negative in the back half of the year? And what has changed within the updated expectation, especially within the grocery business? Because you did say that the pharmacy business, despite the loss of Express Scripts, is doing well. So presumably, you're fulfilling a lot of GLP-1 prescriptions and that's supporting the overall IDs. And so grocery is getting worse than what you had originally thought.Gary MillerchipThanks for the question, Michael. I think, you may have misunderstood what I mentioned in the prepared remarks. What we were saying was that we would expect the identical sales for the final 3 quarters of the year, to be at the low end of our range. And that's essentially what we would have contemplated within our original guidance. That still supports the 1% to 2%, excluding Express Scripts, or 2.5% to 3.5% including Express Scripts.So, what I was really calling out was the -- trying to give you some specific sort of understanding of how we're thinking about those final 3 quarters of the year, and what they may look like. But we're not -- certainly not indicating that we expect the full year -- we won't intend to signal the full year would be at the bottom end of that range. It was really specific to the final 3 quarters.Michael LasserAnd you expect each one of those quarters to be positive? And does that embed the expectation that tonnage has to be positive?Gary MillerchipWe would expect the identical sales to be positive in each of the final 3 quarters. And, we would be assuming on inflation, that inflation continues to decline, as the year progresses and end the year at low single-digit inflation back to sort of more normalized levels. We've seen really the Fresh departments start to reach that point, but the grocery department has started to decline but will still be at elevated levels.So, I think it really ties back to Rodney's comments. Certainly, we would expect to see a continued improvement in unit trajectory to offset some of the decelerating inflation. And I'd say, we've seen a little bit of that during the first quarter because our ID sales didn't decelerate at the same rate as inflation decelerated during the quarter.Michael LasserOkay. And my follow-up question is the perception is that Kroger might be losing a little bit of share, at least within certain customer segments, given that Walmart is doing double-digit grocery sales increases. And the point that you made is a lot of the price investments or promotional investments that are -- Kroger is being made this year are being funded by the CPGs. How far is Kroger willing to use its own P&amp;L to fund further investments to confront, maybe some market share losses to more price-leading players in the marketplace?William Rodney McMullenMichael, as I mentioned before, if you look at different customer segments, customer segments are mainstream and upscale customers. We continue to have strong household growth and strong market share growth with those customers. The ones that we would not be as happy with is our price-sensitive shoppers on a budget. One of the things that we've done a lot of analysis on.If you look at our total go-to-market value, when you look at our price plus looking at our promotional activity and the way people shop our ads, our rewards programs are what you used to call them loyal customer mailings. But now, they're mostly online but personalized offers for each household. Our total value equation is extremely close to what the EDLP merchants would be, we just go to market in a different way.Obviously, the customers that are on a budget, that customer is more focused on this week's shopping. And, you'll see us continuing to make modifications to make sure that we're able to help achieve and go support their weekly budget. Some of that will be impact product sizes and other things. It's not just price alone. As you know, we introduced our brand called Smart Way that's really focused on that entry price point as well. So there's a lot of things that's within it well beyond just price itself. And we've always been very personalized with pricing in terms of doing things for each household individually. Thanks, Michael, for the question.OperatorOur next question comes from Robert Ohmes of Bank of America.Robert Frederick OhmesI think my first question is maybe for Gary. Can you speak a little more about what the FIFO gross margin assumptions ex fuel, how you're thinking about the puts and takes at least for FIFO gross margin ex fuel, for the next 3 quarters? Just obviously, just broad brushstrokes, but like maybe some things we should think about in terms of investing in price versus in more promotions and shrink versus what would be offsets to that in gross margin?Gary MillerchipSure. I think as you know, we don't generally give specific guidance by line in the P&amp;L. But I do think, if you look at what happened in quarter 1, we would see that as a very good proxy for how we think about the rest of the year. From an investment point of view, as Rodney mentioned, continuing to make sure we're delivering value for customers and remaining highly competitive, as customers are managing inflation and the interest rate environment.We do think that shrink will continue to be somewhat of a headwind. It's really in the center of the store. I would say that we -- the team is doing a fantastic job in managing Fresh shrink, but there are a lot of structural challenges right now in center store shrink as you've heard, I think, from a number of different retailers in the marketplace. So those would be the 2 big investments that we'd be fully contemplating for the rest of the year.And then, really the tailwinds are the pieces that we called out in our communication this morning around our Q1 results. And it's really a combination of many of the different plans coming together that we've talked about at our investor meetings, over the last couple of years. First of all, Our Brands is performing really well, as we continue to drive sales growth, mix improvements and improve the innovation and new products in that area. Sourcing benefits and continuing to manage cost and product design really closely.As you heard us mention, we did see Express Scripts as a tailwind to gross margin during the first quarter. That will continue through the rest of the year, although to some extent, the GLP-1 product sales offset a meaningful part of that, so it's not necessary that health and wellness is a major driver of the gross margin rate, but certainly, Express Scripts has an impact. We're seeing strong performance in supply chain in the first quarter, and we believe that's sustainable as well for the rest of the year.And then, of course, alternative profits, as you know, we continue to grow at double-digit rate, our alternative profit business. And as we continue to improve the -- optimizing the KPM business and growing Kroger Personal Finance, we would expect alternative profits to be a continued tailwind to the model. So all in all, I think the best way I think to characterize it would be to look at the different pieces that we shared for Q1. And we would expect similar kind of impacts and drivers in the rest of the year, as you think about gross margin rate.Robert Frederick OhmesGot you. So net basis up FIFO gross margin ex fuel maybe similarly to the way it was up in the first quarter?Gary MillerchipYes. Obviously, there's always kind of puts and takes at different times of the year, and we're very focused on balancing the model. But directionally, I think you're interpreting correctly, that's right.Robert Frederick OhmesGot you, that's helpful. And just a quick follow-up in Our Brands. The -- do you think Our Brands penetration accelerates from here? And also, the -- it sounds like you're being more promotional in Our Brands. So does the margin benefit, from Our Brands penetration stay the same? Or as you -- or is it sort of -- as you promote it more, it has less benefit to gross margin, or is it you're still going to net ahead because you're driving more volume?William Rodney McMullenWhen you look at Our Brands, the margins are typically 600 to 800 basis points better on Our Brands than national brands. It would have been actually at the high side of that, this quarter. If you look within it, and Gary and I both mentioned it briefly, but if you look at Private Selection in some of those parts of Our Brands, grew even faster, which are extremely unique products that customers, what we find, is they love the uniqueness and the quality of it. So it's really the whole mix.So, Smart Way obviously has a lower margin. But, when you look at all the pieces together, we feel good about where we are. We would expect it to continue to be margin accretive for the balance of the year as well. And then also, we're continuing to leverage our own manufacturing plants in many places, too, which is helpful.Gary MillerchipAnd Robby, just to the first part of your question on what we expect in terms of growth in Our Brands, I think we don't target specific growth for Our Brands because we really do use our customer-led approach on our data, and what the customer is looking for really drive where the growth comes from in the business. Having said that, typically during a more challenged economic environment, Rodney mentioned in his prepared comments as well, we do see more customers engage with Our Brands products, and as they start to see the quality and the value, often, we find there's a sort of a higher penetration level that occurs during that time.And typically, it stays at a more elevated level even after the economic challenges have dissipated. So, we're not targeting a specific number, but we do expect that customers will continue to resonate with those products and continue to engage with them at a high level.OperatorOur next question comes from Ed Kelly of Wells Fargo.Edward Joseph KellySo, I got a follow-up to that Michael had. I was hoping that you could quantify the benefit that the GLP-1 drugs are providing to the ID. I mean, it seems material because your pharmacy business is up despite losing, a decent chunk of that through the Express issue. And then, what are you seeing related to the attachment on the Express Scripts business, meaning the impact to in-store from those scripts exiting?William Rodney McMullenIf you look at the second part of your question, it would be extremely modest. It's single-digit basis points, which I never -- it's so low that I'm not comfortable that it's the data is that precise. So it's -- our team has done a great job. I think, one of the things that's important to remind people is our pharmacy team has done an incredible job of helping people identify other ways of getting those prescriptions filled through alternative networks and discount cards and other things.And that has been a huge positive in retaining a huge percentage of those ESI customers, which obviously flow through, too. So, it's not like you just lose all of that business. And what we're finding is in over half the case is that we're actually able to save the customer money versus what they were paying before with ESI. So, it's worked out. Our teams have done an incredibly great job. Obviously, it's a lot of hard work.On terms of the other drug, the margins on that is extremely small in terms of its -- the sales dollars are a lot bigger than the margin dollars. The margin is basically almost no impact. I don't know, Gary, anything you'd want to add, to either one of those?Gary MillerchipNo, I'm good.OperatorOur next question comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Partners.John Edward HeinbockelWanted to drill down on the segments, right? So mainstream, is that about 60% of your business in that ballpark? And then, if you look at how that segment and maybe the upper income are performing is more of the growth transactions. I imagine it would be versus items per basket. And then just lastly, right, on the budget guys, is that -- are they comping negative, right? Or they're just not growing as fast as the other two?William Rodney McMullenIf you look at our mainstream, it would be a little bit more than the percentage you suggested. And our upscale customer, if you look at percentages, the upscale and value customer is about the same. But, if you look at the profitability, the upscale customer is a lot more profitable than the value customer. We would see a very nice positive in the upscale, strong positive in the mainstream and the negative in the value customer. But, if you look at in total, as I mentioned, we had positive household growth in total.John Edward HeinbockelOkay. And then maybe one quick follow-up. The -- I know you guys do a lot of survey work, right? So you talked about the work you've done on value proposition versus EDLP. Is that something that -- or if you do, that is understood and perceived by customers or not? Perception is not caught up with reality.William Rodney McMullenYes, it's a great question, John. And what we find is certain customer segments understand it really well. Other customer segments understand it, but if you only have so much money to spend, you really don't have the ability to stock up on something. So, customers that are more mainstream and upscale, they love -- they would tell us that they feel like they're beating the system by fuel rewards offers that are personalized to them.They buy -- instead of buying one of something, they buy 5 of it so they stock up at a great price. So they very much understand the way we go to market. More the customer on a budget and what we're finding is the customer may understand it but their budget is such that they don't really have the money to stock up. And that's the reason why we introduced Smart Way and some of the other things that we've been doing.OperatorOur next question comes from Kenneth Goldman of JPMorgan.Kenneth B. GoldmanOne of the reasons there's some anxiety among investors about the whole industry is that deflation, I guess, evokes memories of 2016, '17, '18 when ID slowed but also gross margins ex fuel struggled not just for you but for others. And so, it's great to see that this past quarter, right, deflation or disinflation rather, didn't correspond with that kind of decline. Gross margin was up. But I think I'm curious, what's different this time that gives you confidence in your ability to kind of maintain profitability and margins, into this disinflationary environment?I know last time was deflation and you're not calling for that, so maybe that's the answer. But is there also an element that the competitive environment just isn't as intense now, as it was back then? I'm just trying to get your sense of how different it is to be a grocer now than it was back then, and how the world has changed in terms of competition?William Rodney McMullenYes. I guess, I would always hesitate to ever say that it's not as competitive because when you're in the middle of it, it feels massively competitive every day. And I guess, I don't look at that as a negative because at the end of the day, the customer gets a better experience and a better value. And it's our job to figure out a way to grow our business and create value for all the important groups in terms of being able to invest in wages and giving a great value for customers and then creating good value for shareholders as well.And that combination, like for us, it's one of the reasons why we think it's so important to continue to look for process changes and other things to get cost out of the business, and we will achieve -- we expect to achieve over $1 billion of cost reductions this year, and that will be the sixth consecutive year that we've done that. If you look at our importance of our alternative profit business and growing that and other elements and the growth, in terms of more prepared type products and products that have value-add items, those are things, for us, that give us confidence in the long-term sustainability of our model, and gives us the capacity to continue to invest in wages and continuing to invest in great value for customers.So it's really the total ecosystem that we're focused on. I feel much better about our total ecosystem today than 2016, but I feel, comfortable that in 3 or 4 years, we'll say the same thing then versus today because we'll continue to get better and better. And our customers get the benefit of that, our associates get the benefit of that. Gary, it looks like you want to say something?Gary MillerchipWell, just one thing I would add, Rodney, I think you said it really well around, we've obviously built, I think, a more diverse business model now. When you think about alternative profits and the size of fuel and health and wellness alongside the core supermarket business. The only other thing I would add, Ken, is I do think through COVID, and I've mentioned this on previous calls, but just the percentage of customers that now start their shopping online, whether it's through a tablet, through their phone, through a PC, it does give you significantly greater ability to personalize the value to the customer. So I think, you can channel the investments in a far more effective way than you could have done, for example, 5 to 8 years ago. And obviously, we feel we're in a very good spot to be able to do that most effectively because of the power of our 84.51° data science business. And how they can truly use customer information to help save money and save time for the customer.OperatorOur next question comes from Kelly Bania from BMO.Kelly Ann BaniaApologize, if I missed this, but just wanted to maybe unpack just the magnitude of this, the health and wellness outside of the Express Scripts. That sounds like it's coming in line but the GLP-1 impact on, just the total comp and the total transactions for the quarter. And what is in the plan for the rest of this year at this point? Are you planning on this kind of health and wellness momentum to continue through the rest of the year?William Rodney McMullenAs I mentioned before, the impact on sales is a lot more than margin. The margin on that product is very marginal. The thing that, I think our teams have done a great job on, and they've actually delivered is the number of customers or patients that we've been able to retain that had ESI and through the discount cards and other things that we've been able to retain those. If you look at for the balance of the year, we would expect the GLP-1 type drugs to continue. But remember, the impact on profitability is pretty narrow. I don't know, Gary, anything you want to add to that?Gary MillerchipI think you said it well, Rodney. Certainly, for us, Kelly, because of the PBM change, it may not have been as dramatic for us as some others have shared, but it certainly would have been a tailwind during the quarter on sales, as Rodney mentioned. But really, if you look at the gross margin impact, it eliminated much of the benefit in gross margin rate that we saw from Express Scripts.Kelly Ann BaniaThat's helpful. I guess just maybe one more follow-up. In terms of the budget-conscious consumers that you talked about and the comment that they're really prioritizing shelf prices, can you just elaborate on what's happening there? Are they not valuing the total rewards and the personalization and everything that you can offer your consumer? Does that make you think about communicating with them in a different way, your value or changing your strategy and how you connect with that customer segment?William Rodney McMullenYes. We would certainly be modifying the way we connect with that customer. And if you go back a few months ago, that's the reason we introduced Smart Way and we continue to expand that. We're -- the focus of that brand is more of an everyday price position will promote it, but not as aggressive as other things. We've also focused a lot in terms of making sure that we have entry price point items for that customer on things that are most important to them.And those are things where we are modifying how we merchandise in a store and some of the products we offer to that customer, and we're leveraging our own plants as well for that customer.OperatorOur final question for today comes from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer.Rupesh Dhinoj ParikhSo, I just wanted to go back to the promotional backdrop. Just curious on the promotional backdrop, what you guys are seeing today, expectations for the remainder of the year. And as supply is improving, I'm guessing there is also normalization where CPG players would just be more promotional and fund more promotions. Just wanted to get a sense as to what may be normalization and then what could just be driven by a more competitive backdrop?William Rodney McMullenYes. From my perspective and Gary, if you disagree, just say so. But I think, it's much more supply-driven and access to supply. And I say that because there are still a few categories that are constrained and you don't see as much. But the CPG companies, the supply chain in most categories are back to normal. I think there's probably 3 or 4 areas that it's not. And it's more in terms of how things were before COVID. So people are coming to you with offers. We're looking at those promotional offers in terms of how customers react to them.And it's really, I would say, back the way it was before COVID in terms of probably, by far, the majority of it is that, as opposed to just being a more promotional environment.Rupesh Dhinoj ParikhGreat. That's helpful color. And just on quarter-to-date trends, I'm not sure, if there's any commentary you can provide in terms of what you guys are seeing quarter-to-date?William Rodney McMullenYes. Quarter-to-date, IDs would be kind of in the middle part of the range that Gary talked about in terms of identical. So that's where we're tracking so far.Thanks, Rupesh. Appreciate it. Thank you all for the questions today. And as always, before we close, I'd like to share a few comments directly with our associates listening in. In May, we celebrated Kroger's longest serving associate, Mary Tennant, who has worked at our Moundsville, West Virginia store for 65 years. Mary, at 85 years young, loves her fellow associates and our customers, and she plans to keep working at our store. And, if you have a chance to watch Mary's video, you'll understand why I said 85 years young. We can all aspire to have that attitude and that chippiness and fondness at that age.Mary is a great example of coming to Kroger for a job and discovering a career. And she's worked in almost every role at her store. Congratulations and thank you, Mary, on this impressive milestone and your recent birthday.

The award has been offered by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL.Details of the DealValued at $50 million, the contract is projected to be completed by Dec 31, 2025. Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will offer associated engineering support for development of THAAD PAC-3 MSE component.Work related to this deal will be executed in Grand Prairie, TX.What’s Favoring Lockheed?Increasing geopolitical and socioeconomic turmoil worldwide has prompted nations, both developed and developing, to expand their respective military arsenal, with missiles constituting a significant portion of that inventory.Lockheed’s Missiles and Fire Control business unit develops, manufactures and supports advanced combat missiles and rockets for military customers, including the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, NASA and dozens of foreign allies. Some of its prominent products include the PAC-3 missile, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile, JASSM, LRASM and many more.In March 2022, Lockheed successfully integrated the THAAD Weapon System with PAC-3 MSE. This integration allows the PAC-3 MSE interceptor to launch earlier, thereby significantly expanding the MSE defended area.  Such developments increase the chances of Lockheed’s missiles being selected by Pentagon, with the U.S. administration steadily boosting the nation’s defense spending. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.Growth ProspectsThe global rocket and missiles market is projected to reach $82.0 billion by 2031. It is also anticipated to witness a CAGR of 4.2% during 2022-2031, per a report by Allied Market Research firm.Such projections reflect increased growth opportunities for major missile players like Lockheed, Raytheon RTX, Northrop Grumman NOC and Boeing BA in the aforementioned market.Story continuesNotably, Raytheon offers a variety of combat-proven missile defense systems, including the Patriot missile, Standard Missile-6, Standard Missile-3, Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile, Evolved Seasparrow Missile, Tomahawk cruise missile and a few more.Raytheon boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.3%.

To skip our detailed analysis of the defense sector, you can head directly to the Top 5 Defense Contractors in the World in 2023.Global military expenditure has grown by 19% since 2013 to reach a record high of $2,240 billion in 2022 – which accounts for 2.2% of the world’s gross domestic product (GDP). Much of last year’s defense spending was driven by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with Europe witnessing its steepest rise in the post-cold war era, with an increase of 13% compared to 2021. The Middle East experienced a growth of 3.2% on defense spending, as Saudi Arabia returned to the list of the world’s top five military spenders, having spent $75 billion that year. These staggering numbers were released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) in its 2022 report.Largest Defense ContractorsAccording to The Business Research Company, the global defense market has grown from $535 billion to $577 billion between 2022 and 2023 – a CAGR growth of 7.9%. The boom is likely to continue with the industry size expected to cross $700 billion by 2027. Some major beneficiaries of the surge in defense expenditures include companies like Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) whose operating profits increased by 9% between 2021 and 2022. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) was awarded contracts by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) worth $45.68 billion in 2022 – which made up for nearly 70% of its annual revenue.The China North Industries Group Corporation Limited, and the Aviation Industry Corporation of China, also known as AVIC, are also among the prime contractors that profited from the increased spending in the previous year. China is the world’s second biggest military spender after the United States, and much of its armaments are sourced from industries at home. In 2022, Beijing spent an estimated $292 billion on defense expenditure, according to SIPRI.Story continuesIn the United States, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) topped the charts as the largest federal defense contractor, having received over 11% of all spending by the DoD in 2022. This did not only include expenditure incurred on the U.S. military, but also contracts to aid the Ukrainian military against Russian advances. By December, the company had received missile orders worth $950 billion from Pentagon to refill stockpiles in Ukraine, with great focus on the production of HIMARS. These rocket launchers have proven instrumental in turning the tide in the conflict against Russia.Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) was followed by Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) at second spot, winning 6.1% of all defense-related contracts of the U.S. government. In September 2022, Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) was awarded a $985 million order from the U.S. Air Force to develop scramjet-powered hypersonic cruise missiles.The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is another top contractor for the U.S. Department of Defense. In 2022, it received total orders from the DoD worth over $14.7 billion, which included a $2.21 billion contract for its KC-46A Pegasus aircrafts. General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) claimed fourth and fifth positions, respectively, in the list of the top five defense contractors in the United States in terms of overall revenue in 2022. The US is also highly regarded for having the best defense industry in the world.Since the advent of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, priorities of the western world appear to have shifted from the global war on terror and now seem reminiscent of the Cold War era. Finland has joined NATO as its 31st member. Sweden has also applied for membership and is on the brink of receiving it. At least seven members are exceeding NATO’s defense expenditure goal of 2% of the GDP, with others taking urgent measures to increase their military spending and meet the target. You can read more about this in our article, NATO Military Spending by Country: Top 20 Countries.MethodologyWe have used two weighted metrics to rank the top 16 defense contractors in the world. These are 2022 annual revenues of firms that are in the defense industry, and the monetary value of the contracts they have received from the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) during 2022. 30% of weightage was assigned to annual revenue, while 70% to DoD contracts. The United States is the biggest military spender in the world and accounts for nearly 40% of all defense expenditure globally.It is also home to some of the largest aerospace and armaments manufacturing companies that meet modern military procurement needs of militaries around the world with new sophisticated weapons. Therefore, DoD contracts were assigned a greater weightage while creating this list than revenue volumes.For information on DoD contracts, we have used data from USASpending.gov. There was no public data available on Chinese defense companies' contracts with their own or foreign governments. They have been highlighted as biggest contractors based on reports that link them to the People's Liberation Army (PLA). We have used their revenues as a proxy for their contractual magnitude.Top 16 Defense Contractors in the World in 2023Everett Historical / shutterstock.comHere are the top 16 defense contractors in the world in 2023:16.

Once considered an issue isolated to major cities such as New York and San Francisco, the problem has become widespread, with Freddie Mac estimating that the nation is short 3.8 million housing units, a deficit that doubled from 2012 to 2019. As the housing supply struggles to keep up with demand, prices and rents soar.Kit Switch Founders Armelle Coutant and Candice Delamarre stand next to their modular kitchen units. Image courtesy of Kit SwitchThis shortage is driven by a variety of factors amplified by the pandemic, but also predating it. Income inequality, construction material costs, and complex building development regulations all contribute to the lack of affordable housing options. Housing and construction costs in major cities have hit record highs, including an outrageous example in San Francisco where the cost of a public restroom hit $1.7 million.Not only is the construction of new buildings expensive, it also carries a large carbon footprint. Annually, building construction accounts for 2.3 GT of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, driven by raw material processing and building operations. Construction also accounts for a significant amount of waste generation, water consumption, and harmful air emissions.The climate crisis requires immediate, scalable action to reduce GHG emissions. However, if these efforts add to the cost of homes, the affordable housing crisis will further expand. Thus, the U.S. is faced with the paradox of having to lower the cost of buildings while simultaneously reducing their emissions. Furthermore, these homes cannot be built in a way that sacrifices their quality, risking the dignity of their residents.Recently, modular construction has emerged as a major opportunity to tackle this challenge. Modular construction allows a building to be manufactured off-site in prefabricated sections. These modules are then transported to the project site, where they are assembled in place of conventional construction methods. The resulting benefits include a smaller environmental footprint, shorter construction time, and lower costs.Story continuesModular projects allow for faster development because all aspects of construction do not have to occur in the same location and can thus happen separately, in parallel. These prefabricated components can then be assembled and combined, a much more efficient process. Companies like Pre Framing Corp are able to construct building walls in this manner, a process which they claim allows for development to be expedited by a factor of ten. These various prefabricated solutions can be combined to let the time savings accumulate.Prefabricated components can also be developed with a reduced carbon footprint in mind. Companies like Blokable are able to cut GHG emissions from multi-family housing development by 60%. They achieve this by fully electrifying the modular components, incorporating energy recovery ventilation, and utilizing energy-efficient design features.Modular designs are not limited to new building construction; they can convert existing buildings into new residences. Some existing non-residential buildings may simply require the addition of interior features to become habitable. Companies like Kit Switch offer modular kitchens, which can be installed into existing buildings as part of the process of repurposing commercial properties for residential purposes. By avoiding the construction of new buildings, these strategies reduce cost, emissions, and time required.Prefabricated solutions offer an affordable, sustainable mean of combating the housing crisis, without sacrificing quality. Future residents should not expect to live in substandard conditions. As we aggressively look to meet our housing challenges, we must keep in mind that families will be calling these buildings home, and we must ensure they're as good, if not better, than other, traditional options. And with the excellent technologies and strategies emerging today, this is becoming an exciting reality.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Wells Fargo on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Wells FargoWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/wells-fargoEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Wells FargoView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/761632/Modular-Buildings-Powered-by-Novel-Technologies-Present-an-Opportunity-To-Combat-the-Housing-Crisis-Affordably-and-Sustainably]"
155,8e2440d7-84cd-30b4-bec8-29d359e91be8,WFC,2023-06-16,Wells Fargo & Company (WFC) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wells-fargo-company-wfc-attracting-130013058.html,1686834013,STORY,['WFC'],"[Wells Fargo (WFC) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this biggest U.S. mortgage lender have returned +4%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +6.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, which Wells Fargo falls in, has gained 8.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Wells Fargo is expected to post earnings of $1.25 per share, indicating a change of +68.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.4% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $4.77 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +51.9%. This estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.75 indicates a change of -0.4% from what Wells Fargo is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Wells Fargo.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Wells Fargo, the consensus sales estimate of $20.21 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +18.7%. The $80.39 billion and $78.55 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +9% and -2.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryWells Fargo reported revenues of $20.73 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17.8%. EPS of $1.23 for the same period compares with $0.88 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.08 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.24%. The EPS surprise was +6.96%.Over the last four quarters, Wells Fargo surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Wells Fargo is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Wells Fargo. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The report discusses WFII’s guidance to remain defensive in portfolio positioning, as the current economic slowdown is likely to evolve into a moderate recession during the second half of 2023 and into 2024, followed by a gradual, U.S.-led global recovery as 2024 progresses.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230614622882/en/Wells Fargo Investment Institute 2023 Midyear Outlook (Graphic: Wells Fargo)WFII suggests that investors should have a chance to position for an eventual 2024 recovery, but they might have to do so while the economy is still within the grips of the anticipated recession. For now, the important objective for investors is to understand how recessions evolve and to position defensively.""Protecting capital during more challenging times is often as important, or more important, than growing capital,"" said Darrell Cronk, chief investment officer for Wells Fargo Wealth &amp; Investment Management. ""There will come a time to turn more opportunistic in positioning portfolios for a recovery; however, we need to respect the signals and understand when the risk and reward dynamic changes.""For the remainder of the year, WFII anticipates periods of elevated volatility, especially as financial conditions tighten in the second half of the year. Drivers of this elevated volatility include potential inconsistencies between actual economic and policy trends versus the market’s perceptions of those trends. For example, the Fed's stated policy is to keep rates high while high inflation persists, but markets expect rate cuts. Further, actual earnings have contracted for two consecutive quarters, but markets expect earnings to grow. While the markets realign with these trends, there is potential for these disjoins to create financial-market volatility. WFII believes that earnings will contract further in 2023, and that an economic recession will stall 2023 corporate revenue growth. Profits should rebound through 2024, as the economic recovery gradually takes hold, but corporate earnings may not recapture their 2022 peak until early 2025.Story continuesHighlights of WFII’s forecast include:The anticipated U.S. GDP (gross domestic product) growth target for 2023 year-end is 1.1%, and 1.5% for 2024.Inflation will likely fall below 3% in 2023 and through 2024. The target for inflation in 2023 is 2.9% and 2.8% in 2024.The S&amp;P 500 Index is expected to be relatively flat into year-end with stock prices rebounding in 2024. The target range is 4,000 – 4,200 for year-end 2023 and 4,600 – 4,800 for 2024.One more interest rate increase is anticipated in 2023, before cuts start in 2024. The Federal funds rate forecast for 2023 is 5.25% – 5.50% and 3.75% – 4.00% in 2024.The report provides guidance to investors so they can navigate this economic cycle.

The stock lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 1.22%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 1.26%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 4.63%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the drugmaker had gained 7.1% over the past month. This has outpaced the Medical sector's loss of 1.47% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 6.22% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Pfizer as it approaches its next earnings report date. In that report, analysts expect Pfizer to post earnings of $0.63 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 69.12%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $14.01 billion, down 49.51% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $3.35 per share and revenue of $68.1 billion, which would represent changes of -49.09% and -32.13%, respectively, from the prior year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Pfizer. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.04% lower. Pfizer currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Investors should also note Pfizer's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 11.76. This represents a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 14.83.Story continuesMeanwhile, PFE's PEG ratio is currently 1.31. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate.

Preclinical data from all three was presented at the meeting.""It seems like it's the most feasible to get across the finish line early without resulting in delays in availability,"" Melinda Wharton, vaccine policy official at U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said of a shot aimed at XBB.1.5.If XBB.1.5 is chosen as the target for this year's campaign, it would be especially helpful to Novavax, as their protein-based vaccine takes longer to manufacture than rival mRNA-based shots. If the FDA chose a different target, Novavax could again find itself playing catch up to rivals.""The fact that most of the manufacturers are ready to work on XBB.1.5 is an added reason to select this strain or this variant given the immunologic data,"" said meeting chair Dr. Arnold Monto.After the meeting, Novavax issued a release saying it expects to be able to deliver its XBB-targeted COVID shot this fall.FDA staff reviewers in documents released this week said available evidence suggests this year's shots should target an XBB subvariant. XBB and its offshoots, which now account for most U.S. infections, are descendents of the Omicron variant that caused COVID cases to surge to record levels early last year.Story continuesU.S. health regulators are looking to bring the next COVID shots more closely in line with the circulating virus.Pfizer, in its presentation, said it could supply its monovalent shots targeting the XBB.1.5 subvariant by the end of July, while Moderna said it was prepared to supply a new variant-containing shot for fall season.A so-called monovalent, or single target, vaccine would be a change from the most recent bivalent COVID boosters that targeted both the original strain of the coronavirus and Omicron.The FDA takes recommendations from its outside experts into consideration before making a final decision on composition of the shots.Thursday's proceedings comes after an advisory group to the World Health Organization (WHO) last month recommended the next wave of COVID booster shots be updated to target XBB subvariants. Europe's medicine regulators have also backed that recommendation.The CDC recommended booster shots broadly last year. But panel member Dr. Paul Offit questioned whether the shots needed to be recommended for ""everybody every season,"" noting that the highest risk groups are those most likely to benefit from an annual booster.Only about 17% of the U.S. population - some 56.5 million people - received a COVID booster during the 2022-2023 vaccination season, according to government data through early May. Older Americans were boosted at a higher rate than the general population.Between Moderna and Pfizer, Morningstar analyst Karen Andersen expects 75 million doses to be sold in the United States during the 2023-2024 campaign.Moderna last month said it continues to expect the U.S. annual COVID-19 market to be 100 million doses, largely in line with Pfizer's view of 102 million.COVID deaths and hospitalizations have declined in 2023, and the U.S. government in May ended its COVID Public Health Emergency, which had allowed millions of Americans to receive vaccines, tests and treatments at no cost.(Reporting by Bhanvi Satija and Sriparna Roy in Bengaluru; Editing by Michael Erman and Bill Berkrot)]"

Hayes says the payments company has a few things going for it, including an activist investor. Hayes also likes Generac ahead of the summer season. Hayes is less of a fan of Oracle and Eli Lilly due to the stocks' valuations.Video TranscriptDIANE KING HALL: There's a lot of uncertainty in the markets. Fed Chair Jerome Powell adding to that feeling after announcing a pause in interest rate hikes. Well, some of that uncertainty seems to be in the rear view mirror. Powell though, saying despite the pause in June, there may be more hikes ahead. Here to help manage some of the questions and give us some stock picks in this context is Tom Hayes, Great Hill Capital chairman and managing member. So let's start with your picks. You have a couple for us. I find both of them interesting. Let's start with the first pick.TOM HAYES: I'll tell you what, Diane. If I didn't shock you in the A block, I'm going to shock to you right now. So I've got two stocks that are down 80% off their 2021 peaks. And the first one is about as boring as boring gets.DIANE KING HALL: I know. I know what it is. Tell the people.TOM HAYES: This is the Kleenex of home standby generators. It's called Generac.BRAD SMITH: Riveting.TOM HAYES: And you know, Generac has a 75% share in this business. The problem is during COVID, they built up their inventories too much because they couldn't get parts. And it looks like in Q1 was the trough. So they're working through those inventories. They were at 1.7 times normal inventories. They got down to 1.4 times. They think they're going to be normalized by early in the second half. They're going to be cash flow-positive this year.And the thing about this company, first and foremost, because of the pessimism, they're trading at about 15 times their historic average multiples, about 30 times. So you're getting a huge discount in terms of the growth. And the runway ahead is monstrous. They only have 6% penetration. And you could say, well, you know, does it get saturated at some point? People don't buy two generators for their house.Story continuesWhat they find is in the top states where they have the most penetration above 10%, they consistently have the biggest growth rates because what happens is everyone has a generator, so everyone wants a generator. Whereas in the markets where they're under-penetrated, they say, well, none of my friends have a generator. So what do I need a generator for? This is going to continue. This company is could be over the next 12 to 24 months, we think, a double after being down 80%.DIANE KING HALL: And that's because of it being down 80%. So is this also just like a summer play because of, I don't know, potential for just demand, power outages, et cetera. Is that what is part of this?TOM HAYES: Diane, I'm going to bring you in as an analyst at our fund because you hit the nail on the head. This company does well on the basis of weather events, and we just entered hurricane season from June through September. You get the power outages. And by the way, our grid has been underinvested for so many years that what you're seeing is-- you know, when I was growing up, power outage was an hour, 30 minutes. Now in some cases, they're three days, four days, five days.DIANE KING HALL: Like Texas. Yeah.TOM HAYES: And when that happens-- even in Connecticut, it's crazy-- when that happens, everyone goes out and buys a generator. So we're expecting above average weather events for the next four months. And if that's the case, that's going to be a further tailwind for Generac. We're going to see some acceleration.With rates lower, we're going to see the housing market start to come back, Homebuilding come back. That helps Generac as well. So there's a lot of pent up demand with all the millennials, the young folks like you, 33, housing and family formation. You all are buying houses now that rates moderate. You're going to jump on that, you're going to want a generator, and that's what's going to come.DIANE KING HALL: He's the millennial. I'm Gen X.BRAD SMITH: You find me a bank that's going to give me a loan, Tom, we can talk. I also got to talk about PayPal, though. You talk about millennials. Of course, this is like the Venmo season, if you will. Summertime, you're out with your friends, you pay for this pizza, I'll hit you back with that money later on. Let's talk about PayPal here because that's one of your other picks on the day.TOM HAYES: Yeah. This is probably one of the most hated stocks right now. Again, down 80%. Look, they've got 435 million users around the world. That's mind-boggling. 3 billion transactions. So why is everyone all up in arms? Number one, obviously, they got ahead of themselves during COVID. The valuations were crazy.Right now, it's trading at 11 times forward earnings compared to its average historic multiple of 33 times. This thing is a monster. So what happened is they did this acquisition called Braintree. And Braintree really ramped up the volume, but their margins are lower because you don't have as much juice as you have on the normal PayPal transactions.So analysts got worried that you were having margin contraction, but you were having-- it's OK to have margin contraction as long as the bottom line keeps going up. And what they wanted, they wanted it to go up at a certain percentage all the time. I'll take tons of extra volume as long as the bottom line goes up. And that's going to continue to happen.You have two other things. Dan Schulman is stepping down before the end of the year. So you have leadership uncertainty. That will get resolved. They'll have someone good. And then you've got an activist also to catalyze with Elliott in the stock, Elliott Management. So they are good at extracting value. So I think there are a lot of things that can go right while everyone's looking at what can go wrong.DIANE KING HALL: Unless for lack of a better way of expressing it, what could go wrong plays that you have. The ones that, I guess, you're not a fan of. Let's start with Oracle, which surprised me. You're going against the grain here. I mean, it's up on the day, continuing to extend its advance. Explain your thinking here.TOM HAYES: OK. So Oracle and Lily-- I mean, you know, we're not short these stocks, so let's be clear about that. I don't think this is the time to be short aggressively anything. However, we like things that are on sale, we don't like things that are marked up. And we think that after Oracle's earnings, they're now trading about four turns above their average historic multiple.They usually trade at 18, they're trading 22. And we just say, OK, let this thing breathe. It's a great quality business, we get that their cloud is growing. But see if there's a pullback before you get interested. You don't need to chase it up here after earnings is our view.BRAD SMITH: Yeah. And then Lily as well, one of the other picks here, Eli Lilly. Similar, multiple issue, that you're taking?TOM HAYES: Yeah. It's certainly a multiple issue. It's trading at 51 times, I think, relative to its average of 25 times. And it's on the hype around Mounjaro.DIANE KING HALL: That's what I was going to say. I'm sorry to jump in. It has Mounjaro. Like how would you go against this? I mean, these weight loss drugs are all the craze right now.TOM HAYES: Yeah. There's no question. But obviously, they have competition for Ozempic and Wegovy. And the stock has moved up dramatically in anticipation of the approval for weight loss usage. Right now, it's being written off-label. But they want to get the weight loss usage. So two things can happen. Number one, you could get that approval and it's a sell-the-news because it's run up so much.Or number two, god forbid, which I think is very low probability, what if you didn't get that approval and it's already priced that in? So I think, again, I think the long term runway is certainly good, Diane. I agree with you. But I don't want to pay up two times it's average multiple. So for me, they're just a pass for now. It's not they're not great. They're both great businesses. But they're a little rich for me right now, just today.DIANE KING HALL: Understand. We need a sale. All right. We like that. We like a sale. All right, Tom Hayes, thanks to you so much for this great conversation today.TOM HAYES: Thank, Diane. Thanks, Brad. Appreciate i.]"

If Tesla is an AI story, guess what? That's a bubble story. And so I would just take that to mean, OK, Tesla is going to be part of the next bubble.TOM NARAYAN: The reason why robotaxis could be so transformational is the deals that they've struck with Ford and GM, basically opening the supercharger network. And effectively, these two OEMs coming to Tesla and choosing their platform. Elon Musk said on his shareholder meeting-- he said flat out, like, we want to be like Android and really open up the software to everybody.CHRIS VERSACE: The whole thing that's fascinating to me is the real transformation in this industry, where everybody-- Ford, GM, Stellantis, Ferrari, Volkswagen, they're all leaning in to this EV transition.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk in January forecast a ""serious recession"" and subsequently began slashing prices on the electric car company's vehicles.Since then, U.S. vehicle sales have stabilized and vehicle production has recovered to close to pre-pandemic levels as supply chain bottlenecks have eased.Jacobson and Lawler said their companies will keep pushing cost-reduction programs that have already cut thousands of jobs from Ford and GM payrolls. The two companies are under pressure to fund the launch of new electric vehicles that in the near-term will return far less profit than traditional combustion-engine trucks and SUVs.Ford shares were up 1.1% to $14.36 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while GM shares rose 1.5% to $37.93 on the NYSE.Lawler said Ford sees continued strength and growth in its combustion-engine vehicles ""for the next few years"" as it ramps up investment in and production of EVs.Story continuesAt the same time, the company is focused on slashing engineering and manufacturing costs by 50% on its second-generation EVs, including a successor to the F-150 Lightning that is due in the middle of this decade.Lawler hinted that Ford may follow Tesla's lead in employing large underbody castings on its next-generation electric vehicles in its broader efforts to trim costs.Jacobson said GM will not let up on its effort to cut $2 billion out of annual operating costs. As GM faces rising costs for electric vehicles, Jacobson said cost reduction should not be ""a program ... and we go back to the way it was. We have to cultivate continuing improvement on the cost side.""Both executives said their companies' decisions to join Tesla's EV charging network and embrace its NACS (North American Charging Standard) charging protocol will save money and benefit their EV customers.Jacobson said GM has an opportunity to partner with Tesla in developing future locations for EV chargers.Lawler said the adoption of Tesla's charging standard will not require additional capital investment on Ford's part.Owners of GM and Ford EVs will gain access to more than 12,000 Tesla Superchargers in North America, starting in early 2024.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) is arguably one of the most sought-after stocks in the market, with analysts asserting this popular electric vehicle manufacturer has yet to reach its peak.Several factors support this sentiment. Tesla has been securing significant deals with prominent leaders in the auto industry, further enhancing its prospects. Moreover, the company's software and artificial intelligence endeavors present additional opportunities to bolster investor sentiment.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with BABA.

While there may be occasional obstacles, patient shareholders can expect to be rewarded. However, it is important to note that short-term concerns related to overvaluation are likely to persist.Tesla: Onward and UpwardRelentless in the pursuit of expansionThrough both strategic partnerships and new ventures, Tesla is showing why its growth story is far from over.For instance, leading auto companies are seeking to leverage the EV maker's Supercharger Network. Recognizing the value of this technology, General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford (NYSE:F) have separately entered into partnership agreements with Tesla to gain access to it.Starting in 2024, the Tesla Supercharger Network will be made available to GM drivers, albeit with the initial requirement of using an adapter. By 2025, General Motors anticipates equipping its electric vehicles with a NACs inlet, enabling seamless and direct access to Tesla Superchargers. This partnership demonstrates Tesla's efforts to capitalize on its early entry into the EV market, particularly as demand for its own vehicles faces some challenges.In addition, through these collaborations,Tesla's objective is to position its charging infrastructure as the frontrunner in the industry and propel the adoption of electric vehicles in the U.S. Analysts predict a substantial 50% market growth in EV vehicles by 2030, making these partnerships crucial in driving the expansion of the market.Story continuesSoftware is a key source of revenuePiper Sandler predicts that Tesla's stock could reach $280 considering the significant potential of its software opportunity and its impact on the company's profits in the coming years. The software aspect presents a substantial opportunity for Tesla, which is evident from the high price tag of up to $15,000 for its fully self-driving software. It is in this domain the company fully utilizes artificial intelligence to develop and enhance its software offerings.First, Tesla's autopilot feature utilizes AI algorithms to assist with driver assistance and automation. It enables adaptive cruise control, lane centering and automatic lane-changing functionalities. The company's full self-driving technology takes it further by aiming to achieve complete vehicle autonomy, allowing the vehicle to navigate and make decisions without human intervention.In addition, Tesla utilizes neural networks and deep learning techniques to process extensive data collected from sensors, cameras and other sources. These AI-driven networks analyze real-time data to recognize and interpret the surrounding environment, including road conditions, traffic signs, pedestrians and other vehicles.Tesla leverages its extensive fleet of vehicles as a valuable resource for data collection and learning. The company collects vehicle data, including driving patterns, road conditions and real-world scenarios. This data is anonymized and utilized to train and improve its AI models, leading to continuous enhancements in autonomous driving capabilities.Furthermore, Tesla's vehicles receive frequent software updates, often including improvements to their AI algorithms. These over-the-air updates allow the company to refine and enhance autonomous driving features, introduce new functionalities and enhance overall performance.Tesla also employs AI algorithms to optimize its Supercharger network, which enables faster charging for owners of its vehicles. These algorithms analyze real-time data such as charging demand and station availability, dynamically allocating charging resources to minimize waiting times.A rewarding investmentTesla has not only experienced significant demand growth in recent years, but has also seen a noteworthy increase in its profit margin. This margin expansion has led to a remarkable surge of 1,000% in earnings per share from 2018 to 2022, supported by nearly tripled revenue.The company's in-house design approach has played a crucial role in achieving cost savings by reducing the need for alternative products and materials. With a long-term goal of manufacturing 20 million EVs annually, Tesla aims to enhance efficiency, lower production costs and increase demand by lowering prices.To achieve these objectives, Tesla has implemented several strategies. For example, it is constructing smaller factories specifically dedicated to producing the new powertrain generation. This strategic move aims to reduce costs and improve overall operational efficiency. Further, Tesla is actively designing its transistor packages, eliminating the need for rare earth materials in its electric vehicles.It is also making concerted efforts to reduce dependence on costly semiconductors like silicon carbide. These initiatives showcase Tesla's commitment to innovation and cost reduction in its manufacturing processes.RisksTesla and other EV manufacturers face a significant risk from price competition, potentially impacting their profit margins. To stimulate demand, the company has led several rounds of price cuts, including $2,000 for the Model 3 and $3,000 for the Model Y in April. However, this strategy risks compromising Tesla's profitability as other EV manufacturers lower prices to maintain competitiveness, particularly in the Chinese market.Another concern is the overvaluation of Tesla's shares. As of June 15, the stock's price-earnings ratio stands at 75.53, putting it in a worse position than approximately 89.9% of the 891 companies in the vehicles and parts industry. The industry median 17.03, so Tesla's earnings multiple is significantly higher.TakeawayBy focusing on cost-reduction strategies and increasing efficiency, Tesla can improve its margins over time. As the company successfully executes its plans and puts more EVs on the road, the market is likely to recognize and appreciate the true value of its growth potential.Patient investors who understand this long-term perspective benefit from the company's efforts to drive profitability and ultimately generate better returns.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

The cars must be delivered by June 30 in the US and Canada in order to get the deal.Although Tesla has in recent quarters been keen to deliver as many cars as possible to boost its quarterly delivery numbers, it appears there may be another reason for Tesla to shrink Model 3 inventory at this time.A much-rumored update to the Model 3, codenamed project “Highland,” has been reportedly in the works for some time now, and the expectation is the car will be revealed soon. Reports suggest that CEO Elon Musk was going to unveil the updated Model 3 during his trip to China earlier this month.Spotted Tesla’s Project Highland Prototype Model 3 for the first time in several weeks testing in California this morning! @Tesla @elonmusk pic.twitter.com/sIHbWI6Tcy— The Kilowatts 🚗⚡️ (@klwtts) June 6, 2023The free Supercharging incentive comes after the federal government said all Model 3 trim levels were eligible for the full $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit. Previously the base Model 3 rear-wheel drive (RWD) received only half the credit, likely due to where the battery’s critical minerals originated from or where battery components were manufactured.Tesla's Model 3 order page (6/15/23) (Tesla.com)The Model 3 isn’t the only Tesla vehicle that is receiving a free Supercharging incentive. Tesla is offering three years of free supercharging for new purchases of the company’s higher-end Model S and Model X vehicles, with delivery having to take place before June 30.Story continuesTesla’s move to offer Supercharging incentives comes after the company scored two major charging deals, potentially making its NACS (North American Charging Standard) connector the default standard in the US. The latest deal came late last week when General Motors (GM) announced it was joining forces with Tesla to use its Supercharger Network starting next year with the use of an adapter. By 2025 GM anticipates its EVs will have Tesla’s NACS connector built-in, meaning GM’s cars will have direct access to Tesla Superchargers.GM’s move came two weeks after Ford (F) announced a similar partnership with Tesla to enable access for Ford vehicles to Tesla's charging network.Somewhat coincidentally, over the last two weeks, Tesla’s stock has been on a tear, with a record 13-session win streak ending on Wednesday.

172,cd801090-336e-3afd-9f46-6f0c0d9221fc,GM,2023-06-16,Toyota's (TM) Green Revolution: Time to Bet on This EV Underdog?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/toyotas-tm-green-revolution-time-134800958.html,1686836880,STORY,"['7203.T', 'TM', 'F', 'GM']","[In an ambitious shift, Japan’s auto giant Toyota TM has unveiled new strategies to become a frontrunner in the electric vehicle (EV) market, which has sent its stock soaring. Also, despite some overseas investors questioning the independence of Toyota's board,the consensus has largely been supportive of the company's fresh course of action. Shareholders rejected proposals to seek greater disclosures on Toyota's climate lobbying and unanimously voted in favor of all proposed board members. Shares of TM extended their winning streak for the fifth straight session yesterday, rising 4.74% to close at $165.57.With a soaring share price and a bold new strategy, is Toyota a smart bet in the evolving EV market? Or should you book profits from the rally as it is currently hovering near its 52-week highs? First, let’s take a closer look at the substantial shift in Toyota’s EV strategy.A Long-Awaited Wake-Up CallAfter two decades of steadfastly focusing on hybrid powertrains and hydrogen as the future of transportation, Toyota is now waking up to the reality of electric cars. The company has been slow to adapt to the EV revolution, with some of its initial forays, like the Prius Prime and RAV4 Prime plug-in hybrids, being seen as tentative steps rather than full commitments.However, various auto giants’ shift to electric, the success of EV behemoth Tesla TSLA and China's embrace of green vehicles seem to have sparked a transformation in Toyota's strategic outlook.A New Direction Under New LeadershipToyota's previous reluctance to fully embrace EVs stemmed from a belief that the market was not yet ""mature enough"" and that EVs were only one part of the solution to achieving carbon neutrality. With the recent change in leadership from Akio Toyoda to Koji Sato, Toyota is demonstrating a newfound commitment to EVs.TM announced that it would soon offer electric cars with a range of 600 miles or more through the ""integration of next-generation batteries and sonic technology."" Its plans also include the introduction of a full lineup of electric Toyota and Lexus cars by 2026. TM has shifted about half of its R&amp;D staff and expenses into its Advanced Development work as of March.In May, it launched BEV Factory, a space designed specifically for innovating battery EV technology.Story continuesTM’s Technological Breakthroughs &amp; EV StrategyToyota claims it has achieved a ""breakthrough"" in solid-state battery technology. Central to the company’s strategy is the development and mass production of all-solid-state batteries for its EVs. It plans to commercialize this technology from 2027 to 2028, aiming for a 20% improvement in the cruising range compared to current batteries. Additionally, a higher-specification model under research and development is targeting a 50% improvement in cruising range. The company's solid-state batteries promise longer durability and the potential to significantly reduce production costs.The BEV Factory aims to produce EVs with a driving range of 1,000 kilometers (620 miles), which is a significant improvement over competitors like Tesla, whose Model 3 has a range of approximately 430 to 570 kilometers. The ambitious target is to produce about 1.7 million vehicles by 2030. Toyota aims to achieve sales of 1.5 million all-electric vehicles per year by 2026, and 3.5 million units annually by 2030.On the production front, the company is adopting Giga casting, an innovative assembly-line automation technology introduced by Tesla. This change in production could potentially halve factory investment costs. This approach allows significant component integration, reducing vehicle development costs and factory investment. In addition, Toyota plans to use artificial intelligence to achieve automotive designs with a high level of efficiency, aiming for a coefficient of drag of less than 0.20.Continuing Commitment to HydrogenDespite its massive EV push, Toyota has not abandoned its plans for vehicles powered by hydrogen. The company is setting up a Hydrogen Factory to develop the technology further, especially for commercial customers. It is investing in the future of hydrogen power, launching a new division to integrate the technology and build relationships with corporate partners for research and development.A Catch-Up Game in the EV MarketWhile Toyota recognized the EV revolution later than its competitors, it is still the largest car company in the world by volume. Some industry observers believe that if any company can make up for lost time in the EV market, it's Toyota.Although Toyota is entering the EV market late, its size, commitment to innovation, and new strategic focus could make it a strong contender. The firm's ambitious plans show promise but its success will depend on its ability to overcome the significant lead other companies have established in the EV market.Despite some critics taking issue with Toyota's strategy of focusing on multiple fronts across hybrid, gasoline, and electric vehicles, the company maintains that this approach helps cater to the diverse needs of customers in different regions, a strategy it believes will yield dividends in the future.So, should you invest in TM’s bold leap into the EV arena?The Zacks RundownToyota is part of the Zacks Automotive—Foreign industry, which currently ranks in the top 11% of all Zacks Ranked industries, indicating solid prospects. By focusing on leading companies from the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries, we can dramatically improve our stock-picking success. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.TM has exceeded earnings estimates in three of the past four quarters and missed once, with the average negative surprise being 0.94%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s current fiscal sales and earnings implies 11% and 23% year-over-year growth, respectively. Encouragingly, the company is witnessing northbound revision in estimates. The consensus mark for EPS for the current fiscal has moved up 88 cents over the past 30 days.Amid all the excitement, the valuation metrics of TM are not that appealing. At 9.97X earnings, it’s higher than 8.12X for the industry. Even on the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the company is not trading cheap. It is currently trading at 10.88X compared with the industry’s 8.20X.A Word of CautionToyota's high debt levels are concerning. As of Mar 31, 2023, the company's long-term debt was ¥17.07 trillion, higher than ¥15.3 trillion recorded as of Mar 31, 2022. The debt load is also quite high when compared to cash and cash equivalents of ¥7.5 trillion. Toyota's debt-to-capitalization stands at 50% versus the industry’s 35%. High capex and R&amp;D expenses on advanced technologies may further affect near-term financials.Wait-And-See Approach For NowToyota's aggressive push toward electrification, backed by advanced battery technology, improved production methods and continued focus on hydrogen power signals a new era for the automaker. With a renewed commitment to the energy transition and a promising lineup of EVs on the horizon, Toyota is poised to shape the future of the automotive industry.But one shouldn’t overlook Toyota’s stretched balance sheet. Also,the current valuation metrics of the company reflect a premium price for its shares. Considering these factors, its wise to wait for a better entry point. The company's ability to meet its goals and maintain its position as a leading car manufacturer in the era of EVs is yet to be seen.TM currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Still, it anticipates two more bumps before the year is out, so we’ll be in a high-interest-rate environment for the foreseeable future. While many sectors are hurt by this kind of backdrop, banks tend to flourish, in large part because it means they earn more from loans than they need to pay out on deposits.This week’s VIP Pro Picks calls out four bank stocks that also sport exceptional InvestingPro financial health rankings and are trading well under fair value. Among those that rise to the top is regional bank PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC).Like all Pro Picks, PNC and the rest of this week’s selections have all earned a InvestingPro financial health score of 2.75 or more out of 5, which for the last 7 years has indicated outperformance vs. the S&amp;P 500. That score indicates firm financials: top-notch earnings, cash flow, and growth vs. peers.PNC was caught in the larger regional-bank pullback earlier this year, and despite a partial recovery, shares are still off nearly 20% year to date. But Citi analysts upgraded the stock to Buy after that slide and called its management team “one of the best” among large regional banks, citing the bank’s “clean asset quality” and “strong deposit base.”InvestingPro’s metrics align well with those sentiments: PNC rocks a solid InvestingPro health score of 3.02 thanks in large part to a stalwart bottom line. The bank serves up excellent earnings quality, with free cash flow tending to surpass net income, and it has a strong revenue trend that outranks virtually all its peers. With all that, InvestingPro’s fair value calculations say the stock should rise nearly 30% from current levels.And you’ll get paid to wait for that upside: PNC’s dividend has been going strong for 52 years, and its current payout is a generous 4.7%.Want to see the full list of this month's Pro Picks poised to beat the market?

For a deeper dive into how we make our Pro Picks, read more here.PNC FinancialPNC Financial (NYSE:PNC), which was caught in the larger regional-bank pullback earlier this year, rocks a solid InvestingPro health score of 3.02 thanks in large part to a stalwart bottom line: The bank has a strong track record of free cash flow exceeding net income, indicating excellent earnings quality, and its revenue trend is better than virtually all its peers.On top of all that, it has been aggressively buying back shares and its dividend - which it has paid out for 52 years in a row - offers investors an enticing yield of 4.7%.After the hit it took earlier this year, Citi upgraded the stock to Buy and called its management team “one of the best” among large regional banks, citing the bank’s “clean asset quality” and “strong deposit base.” The bank has staged a partial recovery since then, but shares are still down nearly 20% year to date and InvestingPro’s fair value calculations still put upside at 28% from current levels.Goldman SachsGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), of course, needs no introduction. The investment bank has a superb 2.92 InvestingPro financial health score, supported in particular by brawny earnings, a free cash flow yield that beats out nearly all its peers, and a wonderful operating cash flow margin. It also has outstanding price momentum behind it: The stock’s four-year total price return is close to 95%.This is also a solid dividend stock, with a 3% payout and 11 straight years of dividend hikes. UBS and CFRA both recently stamped the stock with buy ratings, and analysts overall give shares plenty of upside - while InvestingPro fair value puts upside over 50% above current levels. Shares have ticked a little under 2% for the year.Story continuesHuntington BancsharesHuntington Bancshares (NASDAQ:HBAN) is another highly rated bank whose shares fell off a cliff earlier this year along with many other regional banks. But it also has a fantastic InvestingPro financial health score, at 3.12, that’s powered by relentlessly rising earnings per share, high average return on invested capital growth over the past two years, and a free cash flow yield of 20% that flattens the vast majority of peers.Most notably, the bank pays an incredible 5.8% dividend and has maintained its payout every year for more than a half-century. Huntington shares, which are down more than 20% for the year, are still quite cheap at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 7.5x - and InvestingPro’s fair value calculations say the stock could rocket over 20% from here.Hartford FinancialJoining its regional-bank brethren is Hartford Financial (NYSE:HIG), which also took a hit earlier this year. The bank’s free cash flow outpaces net income, meaning high earnings quality - and, in that vein, its ratio of cash flow to total debt is in the 97th percentile for the space while its liquid assets comfortably surpass its short-term obligations. Its revenue numbers overtake those of nearly all of its peers, as well, and has an impressive three-year total return on its stock price. And it is keen on returning cash to shareholders: It has been actively buying back shares and pays out a nice 2.4% dividend that it has increased for the past decade running. InvestingPro’s fair value estimate suggests staggering 38% upside, as affirmed by a recent upgrade to buy at Goldman Sachs. Shares have dipped just over 5% for the year.Data as of June 15, 2023.Related Articles3106595Procter &amp; Gamble earns second upgrade this week, JPMorgan raises on EPS upsideUBS upgrades First Solar to Buy on 2023 credit boost]"

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Right now, Eletrobras is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Pinnacle West has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that EBR is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.EBR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 8.72, while PNW has a forward P/E of 20.29. We also note that EBR has a PEG ratio of 0.76. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. PNW currently has a PEG ratio of 3.32.Another notable valuation metric for EBR is its P/B ratio of 0.87. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, PNW has a P/B of 1.51.Story continuesThese metrics, and several others, help EBR earn a Value grade of B, while PNW has been given a Value grade of C.EBR has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than PNW, so it seems like value investors will conclude that EBR is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Also, a focus on the loyalty program bodes well.Shares of Hyatt have rallied 42.6% in the past year compared with the industry’s 17.4% growth. An upward revision in earnings estimates for 2023 reflects analysts’ optimism regarding the company’s growth potential. In the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings has moved up 1.5% to $2.65 per share.Growth CatalystsHyatt continues to expand its presence to boost growth. In the first quarter of 2023, leisure-transient revenues grew 20% year over year and 24% above the 2019 levels on a comparable system-wide basis. The company is optimistic that demand will remain robust for the remainder of 2023.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDuring the quarter, Hyatt announced openings in high-barrier-to-entry markets, including Bordeaux France and Davos Switzerland. Also, it reported openings in cities, including London, Mexico City and Austin, TX.An emphasis on acquisitions bodes well for Hyatt. On Feb 2, 2023, H acquired Dream Hotel Group. Valued at approximately $125 million, the acquisition adds 12 lifestyle hotels (or approximately 1,700 rooms) to the Hyatt portfolio. The agreement also includes an additional 24 signed long-term management agreements for hotels expected to open in the future. The initiative paves a path to boost Hyatt's lifestyle room count (by more than 10%) and expand its presence in New York City by 30%.Hyatt recently announced the acquisition of the asset-light Mr &amp; Mrs Smith platform for an enterprise value of £53 million. The initiative paves the path for strengthening distribution capabilities, particularly across Europe. The acquisition facilitates the addition of approximately 1500 hotels to its portfolio. The acquisition will extend Hyatt’s brand footprint into 20 new markets, including Fiji, Croatia, Iceland and Anguilla.Story continuesMeanwhile, the company has been focusing on its loyalty program for enhanced guest engagement. The reward program offers access to millions of urban renters, thereby facilitating them with global points through rents. Given the best-in-class loyalty program and digital platform, the company’s portfolio of brands is resonating well. H stated that revenues from co-brand credit cards improved significantly from the 2019 levels.The solid RevPAR (revenue per available room) performance due to a rise in leisure-transient demand and improvements in business-transient demand has been aiding the company. In the first quarter of 2023, system-wide comparable RevPAR increased 43% year over year due to an increase in occupancy and the average daily rate.Also, RevPAR was up 6% from the 2019 levels. The upside was primarily backed by strong leisure-transient trends and improving business activity. The company witnessed solid RevPAR gains in Europe, China, the Americas and the Caribbean market region due to strong leisure demand.Given the continued strength of leisure travel demand, a favorable pricing environment and airlift activities, the company is optimistic about continued growth in demand through the first quarter of 2023. Hyatt anticipates system-wide 2023 RevPAR to increase 12-16% from the 2022 levels.HeadwindsThe hotel industry is highly competitive as major hospitality chains with well-established and recognized brands are continuously expanding their global presence.

The company is benefiting from improved non-gaming revenues and expansion in domestic markets. Also, an emphasis on strategic investments and sports betting expansion bode well.An upward revision in earnings estimates for 2023 reflects analysts’ optimism regarding the company’s growth potential. In the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2023 earnings has moved up 80.2% to $1.82 per share.Key Growth DriversWYNN is benefiting from the sound demand for sports betting. It collaborated with several engaging content creators to develop unique sports-themed programs.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the first quarter of 2023, the company launched retail sports betting at Encore Boston Harbor. Following the launch, Wynn Resorts reported a 20% increase in sign-ups (year to date) to its Wynn Rewards loyalty program. The company anticipates solid revenue generation due to new product features and a unique marketing campaign.An increased focus on high-ROI development projects in Boston and the UAE bodes well. Wynn Resorts and Marjan, RAK Hospitality Holding recently reached an agreement to develop a multi-billion-dollar integrated resort on the artificial Al Marjan Island in Ras Al Khaimah, the United Arab Emirates. The resort is scheduled to open in 2026. This will mark the company’s first resort in the MENA region.In the first quarter of 2023, Wynn Resorts progressed in project designs. Also, optimism can be noted due to opportunities arising from the backdrop of beachside setting development. Coming to Boston, the company progressed with planned projects, thereby offering additional parking, food and beverage options and entertainment amenities.Wynn Resorts focuses on non-gaming avenues to drive growth. The company emphasizes introducing innovative non-gaming investments that drive increased tourism and strong shareholder returns. Going forward, WYNN remains optimistic about the strong forward group demand pipeline, ongoing pricing power for rooms, healthy handling declines and a robust programming calendar (in the second half of the year).Wynn Resorts receives a sizable portion of its income from Macau. Given that the Chinese economy is gradually picking up steam, the worst appears to be behind the Macau gambling industry. Wynn Resorts (Macau) and the Macau government came into a 10-year deal for the renewal of Wynn Macau and Wynn Palace Cotai's gaming concession in the fourth quarter of 2022.For 2023, the company expects Capex related to concession commitments in the range of $50-$220 million. Wynn Resorts believes that the proposed Capex and programming will drive growth in the upcoming periods.Story continuesHurdlesAlthough Wynn Resorts reported a solid recovery in the Macau and Las Vegas regions in the first quarter of 2023, a decline in visitation from pre-pandemic levels is a concern. During the quarter, the company witnessed soft international visitation, particularly from Europe and Latin America.Also, the dismal unrated and group business in the Macau region added to the downside. Although visitation is likely to improve in the coming months, it is expected to take time to attain pre-pandemic levels.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksWynn Resorts currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The profit improvement office is on track to generate $65 million of cost savings this year. Management expects $150 million of annual savings from the profit improvement office in 2024.Further, the company focuses on the brand structure, increasing efficiency by removing costs, strategic review of its portfolio, improving working capital and lowering leverage. We note that the sale of Keds and pending licensing of Hush Puppies transitions are well underway. It is also on track to divest the Wolverine leather business. The company looks forward to making further investments in Merrell and softening its lifestyle businesses as well as enhancing Sweaty Betty's global business. Wolverine remains confident in accomplishing a 12% operating margin in 2024.The international business remains one of the company’s key drivers. WWW’s international business was robust in the first quarter and improved 12.6% to $249.7 million. International revenues increased 18% in constant currency. The company’s brands resonated well across the global markets and management sees major opportunities in both the owned and JV-operated markets. Merrell and Saucony were the major drivers across regions, generating 29% and 37% growth, respectively. Saucony's China JV delivered a sturdy quarter as sales increased more than 100%, reflecting strength in its multichannel strategy.Management projects Saucony’s revenues from the China JV to double in 2023.

185,3e27b46a-1bf9-37d7-8a1a-ae8dcc5dbb4e,RCL,2023-06-16,4 Solid Stocks to Buy as Fed Keeps Interest Rate Unaltered,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-solid-stocks-buy-fed-120400004.html,1686830640,STORY,"['RCL', 'CNK', 'OSW']","[The Fed finally decided to leave interest rates unchanged at the conclusion of its policy meeting on Jun 14, putting an end to a string of 10 consecutive rate hikes over the past year. However, the Fed said that it may still need to raise interest rates by half a percentage point by the end of 2023 as the battle to curb multi-decade high inflation is far from over.The Fed’s decision followed the fresh economic data that indicated a slowing inflation, although at a slower-than-expected pace. However, investors seem to be finally relieved as the central bank has finally put a pause on higher borrowing rates.Fed Halts Interest Rate HikeThe Fed said that its decision to keep the interest rate unchanged came up after inflation showed signs of easing last month. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged that the U.S. economy and job market have demonstrated greater resilience than expected, despite the significant tightening of monetary policy implemented over the past year.This resilience is expected to prolong the Fed’s efforts to bring down inflation, but will also allow for a more cautious approach that minimizes potential economic harm.This came as the latest report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, released on Jun 13, showed that the consumer price index (CPI) rose 4% year over year in May, down from April’s jump of 4.9%. The May reading was also marginally lower than analysts’ estimate of 4.1%.With a sharp decline in May’s reading, retail inflation rates reached their lowest level since March 2021, primarily due to a drop in gasoline prices. Grocery prices have also contributed to the decline in overall inflation.On a seasonally adjusted basis, gasoline prices dropped almost 6% in May. Additionally, the yearly rise in the cost of groceries slowed down from its peak of 13.5% to 5.8% in May.The core Consumer Price Index (CPI), which excludes the volatile food and energy prices, fell to 5.3% year over year in May from April's reading of 5.5%, reflecting the smallest increase since the autumn of 2021.Story continuesAlso, the Producer Price Index (PPI) reading, released on Jun 14, showed that producer prices fell more than expected in May. The Labor Department said the PPI fell 0.3% in May after increasing 0.2% in the prior month, declining in three of the last five months.May’s increase in producer inflation was also the smallest in almost two-and-a-half years.Investor sentiment will get a boost following the Fed’s decision to leave interest rates unchanged. This is because raising interest rates can impact consumer spending, raise borrowing expenses, impact economic growth, and have an effect on the stock market.In addition, consumer discretionary stocks are expected to benefit from lower inflation and a pause in rate hikes.

Therefore, they are deemed to be people of influence. As such, it is a legal requirement for politicians to disclose when they buy and sell stocks.While politicians often have differing motiviations for investing in stocks than professional value investors, this information can be useful to see which stocks these figures of influence are bullish on. This also has the benefit of providing unique insight as a starting point for further research.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with ADI. Click here to check it out. ADI 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of ADIPeter Lynch Chart of ADIIn this discussion, I will take a look at two stocks politicians have been buying in the last three months. Let's dive inThe information regarding politician buys and sells comes from regulatory filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. According to the STOCK Act, which was passed in 2012, members of Congress are required by law to file any stock trades with the SEC within 45 days. It is to prohibit members of Congress and employees of Congress from using private information derived from their official positions for personal benefit, and for other purposes. The bill also applies to all employees in the Executive and Judicial branches of the federal government.Analog DevicesAnalog Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) has recorded a total of four purchase transactions in the past three months among politicians. The majority of the trades have been by Congressman Jared Moskowitz of Florida.What does the company do?Analog Devices is a semiconductor company specializing in the design, development and manufacturing of analog and digital signal processing integrated circuits.Its product applications include automotive, consumer electronics and communications equipment.One of its most innovative products is a gigabit multimedia serial link (GMSL). This is the freeway which will enable smart and automotive vehicles to communicate with infotainment, the cloud and much more.Story continuesIts other solutions include a 3D time of flight LIDAR camera system, which enables industrial robots in warehouses to easily assess a package's size as it moves along a conveyor belt.2 Quality Stocks Politicians Have Been BuyingGrowing financials Analog Devices reported strong financial results for the second quarter of 2023 on May 24. Its revenue of $3.26 billion beat analyst forecasts by $56.75 million and rose by 9.79% year over year.This growth rate was not as fast as the 21% reported in the prior quarter and the 79% growth reported in the previous year. However, the business still reported strong results overall given the cyclical pullback in the semiconductor industry.Part of Analog Devices' positive results have been driven by its strong presence in the stable and growing health care industry. The company has become a leader in medical imaging, with strong market share in the devices which make up x-ray machines, ultrasound and CT scanners.2 Quality Stocks Politicians Have Been BuyingIn addition, its products help with instrumentation such as ventilators and defibrillators, which became vital during the pandemic. Personal health monitoring is another growing trend the company is poised to benefit from. Wearable health care devices require low power consumption and high performance, which is perfectly suited to Analog Devices' chips.The company also reported solid 16% growth in its aerospace and defense solutions, which is also not as cyclical as consumer segments. Its automotive segment contributed to 24% of total revenue and grew 24% year over year.Communications was an area of weakness as its consumer applications declined by 20% quarter over quarter due to the cyclical environment.Moving onto profitability, its gross margin was a solid 73.7%, which was up slightly versus the prior quarter.Its operating margin was a solid 35%, with $1.1 billion in operating income generated up 19.35% year over year.2 Quality Stocks Politicians Have Been BuyingThe business reported earnings per share of $1.92, which beat analyst forecasts by 9 cents.Over the trailing 12 months, Analog Devices has generated a staggering $4 billion in free cash flow, or approximately 31% of revenue, which is fantastic.The company also reported $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet. The business does have fairly high total debt of $6.7 billion, but the majority is long-term debt.The business pays a consistent forward dividend yield of 1.83% and has been buying back shares.ValuationAnalog Devices trades with a price-earnings ratio of 27, which is higher than the average of 25 for the sector. However, it is 25% cheaper than its five-year average.2 Quality Stocks Politicians Have Been BuyingThe GF Value Line indicates a fair value of $212 per share. Based on its historical ratios, past performance and analysts' future earnings projections, the stock is fairly valued at the time of writing.2 Quality Stocks Politicians Have Been BuyingSimon Property GroupSimon Property Group Inc. (NYSE:SPG) is a real estate investment trust that focuses on buying, developing and managing properties in the retail sector, including shopping malls, premium retail outlets and mixed-use developments.Its famous properties include The Mall of America in Minnesota, which is one of the largest malls in the U.S. In addition, the business owns The Forum Shops at Caesars Palace, Sawgrass Mill in Florida and even Bicester Village in the U.K.The stock was purchased multiple times in the past three months by Victoria Spartz, a representative from Indiana.2 Quality Stocks Politicians Have Been BuyingSolid financials Simon Property Group reported financial results for the first quarter of 2023 on May 2. Its revenue of $1.35 billion beat analyst forecasts by $84 million and rose by 4.24% year over year.This was a solid result given the many challenges brick-and-mortar retail outlets have faced since the lockdowns in 2020. The continued growth in e-commerce also makes these outlets optional as opposed to necessary.Despite these challenges, Simon Property Group reported a strong occupancy rate of 94.4%, which increased by 110 basis points year over year. Its average base minimum rent was $55.84 per square foot, rising 3.1% year over year.2 Quality Stocks Politicians Have Been BuyingThe company has built up strong momentum with its leases, signing 1,200 in the first quarter for a total of 5.9 million square feet. The business also reported a strong rebound in its tourist-focused centers. In addition, it opened a new West Paris Designer Outlet in Normandy, France, which indicates the demand for these type of outlets is still strong.Simon Property Group is currently constructing another high-end outlet in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which it expects to open by the fall of 2024. Its total pipeline includes around 2,000 residential units and hotel rooms across various projects.The REIT reported strong operating income of $662 million, which rose by close to 7% year over year. Its cash and cash equivalents rose to $1.5 billion, up from $621 million in the prior quarter.Its total liquidity was a solid $9.3 billion, which includes a $5 billion revolving credit facility that adds increased flexibility.2 Quality Stocks Politicians Have Been BuyingAs a REIT, Simon Property Group pays a strong dividend of 3.32%, or $1.85 per share, up 9% year over year.ValuationThe stock trades at a price-to-funds from operations ratio of 9, which is 25% cheaper than its five-year average. Further, its price-to-adjusted funds from operations ratio of 10 is 31% cheaper over the same period.In addition, the company's price-to-cash flow ratio of 9.45 is 18% cheaper than its historic levels.The GF Value Line also indicates a fair value of around $120 per share. Therefore, the stock is fairly valued at the time of writing.2 Quality Stocks Politicians Have Been BuyingFinal thoughts Both Analog Devices and Simon Property Group are high-quality companies that politicians have been buying. Analog Devices is uniquely positioned to continue to grow despite a macro pullback in the semiconductor market as a whole. Simon Property Group is also an interesting business. At a macro level, I would assume it would be struggling due to macro headwinds. However, management's execution and its popular tourist locations have debunked this expectation.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Some retirees are now tapping their principal to make a decent living, pressed for time between decreasing investment balances and longer life expectancies.Retirement investing approaches of the past don't work today.For many years, bonds or other fixed-income assets could produce the yield needed to provide solid income for retirement needs. However, these yields have dwindled over time: 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s were around 6.50%, but today, that rate is a thing of the past, with a slim likelihood of rates making a comeback in the foreseeable future.The effect of this drop in rates is substantial: over 20 years, the change in yield for a $1 million investment in 10-year Treasuries is over $1 million.And lower bond yields aren't the only potential problem seniors are facing. Today's retirees aren't feeling as secure as they once did about Social Security, either. Benefit checks will still be coming for the foreseeable future, but based on current estimates, Social Security funds will run out of money in 2035.So what's a retiree to do? You could cut your expenses to the bone, and take the risk that your Social Security checks don't shrink. Or you could find an alternative investment that provides a steady, higher-rate income stream to replace dwindling bond yields.Invest in Dividend StocksAs a replacement for low yielding Treasury bonds (and other bond options), we believe dividend-paying stocks from high quality companies offer low risk and stable, predictable income investors in retirement seek.Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.Story continuesGoing beyond those familiar names, you can find excellent dividend-paying stocks by following a few guidelines. Look for companies that pay a dividend yield of around 3%, with positive annual dividend growth. The growth rate is key to help combat the effects of inflation.Here are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.Regions Financial (RF) is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.2 per share, with a dividend yield of 4.44%. This compares to the Banks - Southeast industry's yield of 2.71% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.71%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 17.65%. Check Regions Financial (RF) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;TIM S.A. Sponsored ADR (TIMB) is paying out a dividend of $0.1 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.88% compared to the Wireless Non-US industry's yield of 0.12% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 23.45% over the past year. Check TIM S.A. Sponsored ADR (TIMB) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $0.48 per share, U.S. Bancorp (USB) has a dividend yield of 5.98%. This is compared to the Banks - Major Regional industry's yield of 4.27% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 4.35%. Check U.S. Bancorp (USB) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?Overall, that is true. But stocks are a broad class, and you can reduce the risks significantly by selecting high-quality dividend stocks that can generate regular, predictable income and can also decrease the volatility of your portfolio compared to the overall stock market.An upside to adding dividend stocks to your retirement portfolio: they can help lessen the effects of inflation, since many dividend-paying companies (especially blue chip stocks) generally increase their dividends over time.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.You may be thinking, ""I like this dividend strategy, but instead of investing in individual stocks, I'm going to find a dividend-focused mutual fund or ETF."" This approach can make sense, but be aware that some mutual funds and specialized ETFs carry high fees, which may reduce your dividend gains or income, and defeat the goal of this dividend investment approach. If you do wish to invest in a fund, do your research to find the best-quality dividend funds with the lowest fees.Bottom LineRegardless of whether you select high-quality, low-fee funds or stocks, looking for a steady stream of income from dividend-paying equities can potentially lead you to a solid and more peaceful retirement.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

189,001f9065-a38a-3ed8-aabe-d9d0249941b6,V,2023-06-16,10 A-Rated Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-rated-stocks-billionaires-loading-204731985.html,1686862051,STORY,"['XOM', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'JNJ', '^GSPC', 'CVX', 'V', 'TSM', 'MSFT']","[In this piece, we will take a look at ten A-rated stocks billionaires are loading up on. For more stocks, head on over to 5 A-Rated Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On. The stock market is made up of thousands of companies. Combined with the fact that the regular, retail investor has an unprecedented amount of data available to them for making decisions, this makes investing appear to be a tedious task where one is always at the risk of either missing out on the next Apple or making a blunder based on missing out on a key piece of information.These apparent traps are compounded by the fact that these days the stock market is at continuous odds with what most people think will happen. The American conversation has been full of predictions of a recession after the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hike cycle made conducting business quite difficult. With the fear of a recession on the horizon, the stock market doesn't perform too well either. However, the market is doing just fine. Don't believe us? Well, the NASDAQ 100 index is up by 34% year to date, the S&amp;P 500 has gained 12%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has returned 1.8%, and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) still hasn't lost money.So this makes us wonder if listening to all the predictions of gloom and doom is really worth it. Well, they might be since the market these days is responding to sector specific trading signals. This is evident when we look at the NASDAQ's gains. The index, dominated by the technology sector, is seeing a recovery in the industry that was gutted in 2022. And the others, particularly the S&amp;P and the NYSE, which are a balanced bunch representing firms from all walks of lives, are wary of a broader softening environment in the wake of a year long battle with inflation and high interest rates.As if this weren't enough, there are some folks who believe that a recession might be a good thing for the stock market. Or at least that's what the chief executive officer of Destination Wealth Management Mr. Michael Yoshikami believes. In an interview with CNBC in late May, the head of the firm that enables the rich to manage their money shared his take on the current back and forth in the media about a recession. His thinking really isn't that complicated, and it involves understanding the actions of the Federal Reserve in case the economy does not cool down. Mr. Yoshikami believes that if this is the case then the Federal Reserve might not reduce the interest rates or could even hike them further. Given that stock market sentiment is actually a reflection of investors' estimates of what will happen in the future, a robust economy stands the risk of shaping investor sentiments towards further hikes and as a result making money flow out of the market and into safe haven assets, money market accounts, or bank savings accounts.Story continuesSpeaking of safe haven, the U.S. dollar has been long considered the asset of choice for risk aversion fueled by the fact that the U.S. government is unlikely to fail its debt obligations. While the U.S. might not fail anytime soon as both Congress and Senate just passed another extension of the debt ceiling, the current macroeconomic environment might not bode well for the Treasury this time around. At least that's what is on the mind of Otavio Costa, Portfolio Manager at Crescat Capital. In a recent Twitter thread, he shared that after the debt deal, Treasury is likely to issue debt fast, but as opposed to previous issues, this time around it might not find willing buyers. According to Mr. Costa, foreign investors will consider the effects of these securities on existing debt held by banks and the risk of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates. Higher rates reduce the price of current bonds and the risk of future interest rate hikes makes investors wary of buying more debt due to this fact. The soft treasuries market also reduces the appetite for U.S. bonds for central banks, and according to the portfolio manager, if central banks consider making gold account for 40% of their reserves, they could inject as much as $32 trillion into the gold market to cause the price to shoot by a whopping 25%.So is gold primed to shine and should you bid farewell to the stock market? Well, Ken Fisher of Fisher Investments believes that gold is quite volatile, explaining that:There's nothing wrong with gold. It's a commodity, it's volatile. The fact is sometime people think of it this way, sometimes they think of it that way. Lately they've been thinking maybe it's an inflation hedge. Mind you, over all those decades I just talked to you about, there was always inflation. You follow that? And it didn't hedge that inflation very well. Number two, what can we say about it in the very long term? That it has a return that's positive, a little bit lower long term average than, let's say, long term U.S. Treasury Bonds. With a higher volatility then bonds. That doesn't shock you very much. Because bonds are expected to have fairly low volatility. Mind you on the other hand over those same time periods, very long time period, it has about the half the return of stocks, with an actually markedly higher volatility than stocks. That's the point that surprises people. Lower return, higher volatility. Gold gets about 80% of its, maybe 85% of its long term total return from about 15% of time periods. Whereas stock thrives about two thirds of the time period, bond thrives a little more than that. If you can predict gold, you need no advice from me whatsoever.Mic. Drop. So, it's not gold, it's not bonds, but it's stocks. To make your journey easier, we took a look at some A-rated stocks and decided to see which have received the blessings of billionaires. Out of these, the top picks are Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Alphabet Inc.

To skip our detailed analysis of the journalism industry, click 5 Biggest Journalism Companies in the US.The mass media industry has remained a crucial part of the global economy for centuries. Whether you are interested in the financial markets, politics, or entertainment, it is likely that much of your opinion on any of these subjects will be heavily influenced by the media you consume. In this manner, journalism is an essential tool in the arsenal of those who prioritize controlling public opinion. And while many are heralding the age of modern technology and the internet as the end of an era for traditional media, it would be premature to write off the companies that have survived in this space for so long.Adapting to a New EnvironmentWith the rise of the internet, companies in many industries began to see their operations being impacted. Those operating within the journalism sector were no different, considering they found themselves often outmaneuvered by social media platforms offering news and information in real-time to a global audience at lower costs. However, media companies have been fighting back. According to a PwC outlook report on the global entertainment and media industry between 2022 and 2026, while total global entertainment and media revenue fell by 2.3% in 2020, it also rose by 10.4% the very next year. Based on this growth, it was estimated that the industry would grow by 7.3% between 2022 and 2026, rising at a compound annual growth rate of 4.6%.This growth has been heavily attributed to the adaptation of media and journalism companies to the digital environment. With the COVID-19 pandemic in particular, most readers and audiences developed a greater interest in digital content, making this a new and largely untapped market for many traditional media companies. Identifying and exploiting this market is what is allowing many of these companies to retain their position in the economy. For example, according to an article published by the Reuters Institute this January, more publishers today are willing to pour resources into podcasts and digital audio, which have been useful in increasing brand loyalty for many news brands. Media and journalism companies are also beginning to integrate artificial intelligence into their products to offer personalized experiences to their audiences. Additionally, while print media seems to be going out of fashion, a trend expected through 2023 is that of traditional news media companies taking their print publications online to make them more accessible for their readers.Story continuesWhile the rapidly shifting environment is continuing to change the way most media companies operate, many other mass media and journalism companies, such as Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) are continuing to flourish with their original business models. In the fiscal second quarter of 2023, for instance, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) generated revenues of $21.8 billion, beating estimates by a small amount. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) also beat analyst estimates by $376.2 million in the fiscal first quarter, with its revenue of $29.7 billion. The performance of companies such as these is evidence of the resilience of the US media and journalism companies, whether because they are highly profitable behemoths in their industry or because they are especially adept at conforming to changing conditions and trends. In light of this resilience, we have compiled a list of the largest US journalism companies in the market today.Biggest Journalism Companies in the USPhoto by Roman Kraft on UnsplashLet's now take a look at the 15 biggest journalism companies in the US. Our MethodologyEach of the journalism companies listed below is thus a major contributor to the US mass media and journalism industry since they either operate major news channels, TV networks, and newspapers or aid their distribution among the American populace.

Specifics on the upgrades include:Engineers have deployed 5G Ultra Wideband service using Millimeter Wave (mmWave), its premium, high-band spectrum which allows for extremely fast speeds and massive capacity as well as C-band spectrum designed for fast speeds, high capacity and wide coverage. With the recent deployments and upgrades, more people in Cincinnati now have access to 5G service from Verizon. Verizon Engineers have deployed 5G Ultra Wideband service using its C-band spectrum designed for high capacity and wide coverage. Most notably, Verizon’s 5G Ultra Wideband service has recently expanded to areas near Delhi, Downtown Cincinnati, Mount Auburn, Mount Lookout, Avondale, North College Hill, Kenwood, Sycamore, Springdale, Crescentville, Fairfield, Mount Healthy, Lebanon, and Woodsdale.Additional coverage has also been added to Paycor Stadium and Amazon CVG Airport.Cincinnati’s exceptional 5G coverage uses a combination of mmWave spectrum and Verizon’s recently acquired C-band spectrum. Verizon engineers are using 60 MHz of C-band spectrum to deliver 5G service to customers. By the end of the year, customers in Cincinnati will be able to take advantage of nearly twice that amount of spectrum as it becomes available for 5G Ultra Wideband. That additional bandwidth will turbo charge the service, offering significantly higher speeds, much greater capacity to accommodate more customers and more robust services.Lastly, the addition of 5G service and the many additional wireless solutions allow far more data to travel on the wireless network in Cincinnati. That exponential increase in data carried into and out of the cell sites serving the community requires upgraded fiber optic cable links. Fiber optic cables are used to move data between cell sites and connect those sites to the rest of the network. Verizon has increased the capacity on the fiber connections in many cell sites in the Cincinnati area so they can carry 10 times the amount of data.Story continues“We know customers count on us, and we work everyday to ensure we deliver for them.

Its top line in second-quarter fiscal 2023 was driven primarily by higher pricing across the regions and increased volumes.The company, in its fiscal second quarter call, said that it expects full-year fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $11.30-$11.50, indicating a 10-12% year-over-year growth. For the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the company expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $2.85-$2.95, suggesting a rise of 10-14% from the year-ago quarter.Air Products is benefiting from investments in high-return projects, new business deals, acquisitions and productivity initiatives.

""It's very unlike our traditional tree planting, litter pickups, and invasive species removals.""The Mississippi River Basin encompasses 31 states and is the world's third-largest drainage basin. When complete, Purdue University will place the nesting boxes in the basin, specifically Southern Indiana's Blue River.Hellbenders, like many amphibians, breathe through their porous skin, making them extremely vulnerable to water pollution. That is why they are only found in water that is clear, clean and well-oxygenated with large rocks scattered on the bottom. Sedimentation can also fill in the spaces they occupy under large slabs of bedrock, which is why they have disappeared from many of their former river homes.The pollutants Cummins Water Works and The Nature Conservancy are partnering to reduce include nutrient pollution (nitrogen and phosphorus), as well as soils and sediment. Hellbenders, the largest salamander in North America, do not filter water. However, they are a good indicator of stream health, water quality and a river's ecology.The nesting boxes will provide the salamanders a safe place to lay their eggs. They will also allow researchers to monitor their growth and development, as the top of each box is equipped with a camera port to capture activity.Story continuesThrough Cummins' Seymour Engine Plant's Day of Caring initiative, 24 volunteers worked over two days to cut and form chicken wire and mesh into the nest box shape, secure with zip ties, pack the concrete into place and construct the nest box lids. Also present, providing supervision and guidance, were Joe Schmees, TNC Representative, and Nick Burgmeier, Agriculture Research Biologist and Extension Wildlife Specialist, Purdue University.""We were able to complete 18 boxes, which is phenomenal,"" said Jordan Grawe, event lead and Cummins Air Handling Team Leader. ""I'm very proud to have been involved in this project with my colleagues. At the end of the day, you feel like you have done something very positive for your community and are making an impact in the world.""Hellbenders have been known to grow up to 29 inches long, though most will average about 12-15 inches. They are an endangered species in Indiana, and historical records indicate the Hellbender once populated Fourteen Mile Creek, Little Blue River, Whitewater River, Silver Creek, Indian Creek, the Ohio River and the Wabash River.Today, the Hellbender's singular habitat in Indiana is the clean and clear Blue River of Southern Indiana. The lack of younger populations of this species in locations where they live has become a growing concern. The work of Cummins volunteers and its community partners in creating a protected habitat for this special creature helps address that concern.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cummins Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cummins Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cummins-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cummins Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/761600/Cummins-Partners-To-Protect-Endangered-Salamander]"

(NYSE:CMI),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/estimating-fair-value-cummins-inc-130025135.html,1686834025,STORY,['CMI'],"[Key InsightsThe projected fair value for Cummins is US$215 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityWith US$234 share price, Cummins appears to be trading close to its estimated fair valueOur fair value estimate is 16% lower than Cummins' analyst price target of US$256In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Cummins Inc. (NYSE:CMI) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Cummins The ModelWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.13bUS$2.74bUS$2.82bUS$2.21bUS$2.40bUS$2.30bUS$2.25bUS$2.23bUS$2.23bUS$2.25bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x8Analyst x6Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ -3.93%Est @ -2.12%Est @ -0.85%Est @ 0.04%Est @ 0.66% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.8% US$2.0kUS$2.3kUS$2.2kUS$1.6kUS$1.6kUS$1.4kUS$1.3kUS$1.1kUS$1.1kUS$972(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$15bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.2b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.8%– 2.1%) = US$35bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$35b÷ ( 1 + 8.8%)10= US$15bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$30b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$234, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Cummins as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.118. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for CumminsStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Machinery market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

To skip our detailed analysis of the journalism industry, click 5 Biggest Journalism Companies in the US.The mass media industry has remained a crucial part of the global economy for centuries. Whether you are interested in the financial markets, politics, or entertainment, it is likely that much of your opinion on any of these subjects will be heavily influenced by the media you consume. In this manner, journalism is an essential tool in the arsenal of those who prioritize controlling public opinion. And while many are heralding the age of modern technology and the internet as the end of an era for traditional media, it would be premature to write off the companies that have survived in this space for so long.Adapting to a New EnvironmentWith the rise of the internet, companies in many industries began to see their operations being impacted. Those operating within the journalism sector were no different, considering they found themselves often outmaneuvered by social media platforms offering news and information in real-time to a global audience at lower costs. However, media companies have been fighting back. According to a PwC outlook report on the global entertainment and media industry between 2022 and 2026, while total global entertainment and media revenue fell by 2.3% in 2020, it also rose by 10.4% the very next year. Based on this growth, it was estimated that the industry would grow by 7.3% between 2022 and 2026, rising at a compound annual growth rate of 4.6%.This growth has been heavily attributed to the adaptation of media and journalism companies to the digital environment. With the COVID-19 pandemic in particular, most readers and audiences developed a greater interest in digital content, making this a new and largely untapped market for many traditional media companies. Identifying and exploiting this market is what is allowing many of these companies to retain their position in the economy. For example, according to an article published by the Reuters Institute this January, more publishers today are willing to pour resources into podcasts and digital audio, which have been useful in increasing brand loyalty for many news brands. Media and journalism companies are also beginning to integrate artificial intelligence into their products to offer personalized experiences to their audiences. Additionally, while print media seems to be going out of fashion, a trend expected through 2023 is that of traditional news media companies taking their print publications online to make them more accessible for their readers.Story continuesWhile the rapidly shifting environment is continuing to change the way most media companies operate, many other mass media and journalism companies, such as Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) are continuing to flourish with their original business models. In the fiscal second quarter of 2023, for instance, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) generated revenues of $21.8 billion, beating estimates by a small amount. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) also beat analyst estimates by $376.2 million in the fiscal first quarter, with its revenue of $29.7 billion. The performance of companies such as these is evidence of the resilience of the US media and journalism companies, whether because they are highly profitable behemoths in their industry or because they are especially adept at conforming to changing conditions and trends. In light of this resilience, we have compiled a list of the largest US journalism companies in the market today.Biggest Journalism Companies in the USPhoto by Roman Kraft on UnsplashLet's now take a look at the 15 biggest journalism companies in the US. Our MethodologyEach of the journalism companies listed below is thus a major contributor to the US mass media and journalism industry since they either operate major news channels, TV networks, and newspapers or aid their distribution among the American populace.

The company continues to gain from its stringent pricing actions and accelerated revenue growth management plans. Revenue growth management initiatives led to double-digit pricing gains worldwide in the first quarter of 2023. This led to impressive organic sales growth in the quarter.On an organic basis, Colgate’s sales advanced 10% in the first quarter, with improvements in all divisions and categories. This marked the 17th successive quarter of organic sales growth at or above its long-term target of 3-5% growth. While volumes remained soft, pricing gains of 12% aided organic sales. Bold pricing actions and accelerated revenue growth management plans were key drivers.Colgate remains on track with its efforts to improve product availability through enhanced distribution to newer markets and channels. However, the company is not immune to higher raw material and logistics costs worldwide and unfavorable currency issues.Shares of Colgate have risen 3.4% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 1.9% and the Consumer Staples sector’s rise of 1.6%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s current financial-year sales and earnings suggests growth of 6.4% and 5.7% from the year-ago reported numbers.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat’s Working Well for CL?Expanding the availability of products through enhanced distribution to newer markets and channels is one of Colgate’s priorities to improve organic sales. The company is aggressively expanding into faster growth channels while extending the geographic footprint of its brands.In 2019, Colgate expanded its portfolio by introducing pharmacy brands like elmex and meridol to newer markets. It remains impressed with the performance of professional skincare businesses — Elta MD and PCA Skin — in spas and dermatologists.The company expanded its premium skincare portfolio with the buyout of the Filorga skincare business. Colgate is witnessing strong market share gains in North America and China, its two largest markets, with increased share gains across all other regions.Innovation and in-store implementation have been the guiding principles for Colgate’s growth strategy over the years. CL’s innovation strategy is focused on growing in adjacent categories and product segments. It is also focused on the premiumization of its Oral Care portfolio through major innovations. Backed by premium innovation, products, including CO. by Colgate, Colgate Elixir toothpaste and Colgate enzyme whitening toothpaste, have been performing well.Its innovation efforts are highlighted by the continued expansion of the Naturals and Therapeutics divisions and the Hello Products LLC buyout. The company also partnered with Philips to introduce electric toothbrushes in Latin America, where the use of electric toothbrushes is low. This long-term deal will bring together the world’s number one oral care brand and the number one manufacturer of sonic toothbrushes under a co-brand, namely Philips Colgate. This product line will come with a variety of electric toothbrushes at different prices.Colgate’s Hill's business has been a major contributor to sales growth for the past few quarters. The segment reported sales growth of 21.5% in the first quarter, with organic sales growth of 14%. Results gained from an 11.5% increase in pricing, volume growth of 12% on a reported basis and 2.5% on an organic volume basis, partly offset by a 2% adverse currency impact. Organic sales were aided by gains in the United States and Europe.Strength in oral care and pet nutrition remains a key growth driver. The company’s newly launched Prescription Diet Derm Complete has been gaining market share and is likely to be rolled out internationally in the coming quarters. Colgate also remains focused on expanding the availability of its products through the e-commerce channel as more consumers are using online services for their essential needs.Management raised its sales and profit forecast for 2023. Colgate-Palmolive anticipates net sales growth of 3-6%. The current projection indicates gains from the acquisitions of pet food businesses, offset by a low-single-digit adverse currency impact.The company anticipates full-year organic sales growth between 4% and 6%. CL foresees adjusted gross profit margin expansion and increased advertising investments. Management guided mid-single-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share.Story continuesHurdles to OvercomeDespite sales growth, the company has been witnessing continued pressure from raw and packaging material costs, which dented the gross margin performance in the first quarter of 2023. This includes an adverse impact of 90 bps from private-label sales resulting from the previously disclosed acquisitions of pet food businesses.Colgate’s gross profit margin contracted 160 basis points bps to 56.9% on a GAAP and adjusted basis. Additionally, the adverse foreign currency impact is likely to affect the company’s profitability in the near term.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the broader Consumer Staples space are Coty Inc. COTY, Procter &amp; Gamble PG and Clorox CLX.Coty currently sports a Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) and has an expected long-term earnings growth rate of 15.6%.

CHS provides all levels of care across the Central Valley area of California through a four-hospital network.Apart from standardizing the use of pulse oximetry, CHS will also deploy other Masimo technologies like 800 Root Vital Signs Monitoring and Connectivity Hubs, and 200 Rad-97 Pulse CO-Oximeters with NomoLine capnography in its four hospitals.The CHS hospital-network has plans to implement Masimo Patient SafetyNet for centralized remote patient monitoring. The Masimo Patient SafetyNet will allow the hospital-network to seamlessly transfer patient data into electronic medical records (EMRs). The idea is to streamline nursing workflows and improve patient safety.The CHS also plans to expand its perioperative monitoring capabilities through installations of advanced Masimo rainbow parameters including SpHb non-invasive and continuous hemoglobin monitoring, PVi pleth variability index, SedLine brain function monitoring, O3 regional oximetry and LiDCO hemodynamic monitoring.Shares of Masimo have risen 9% year to date compared with the industry’s growth of 5.5%. The S&amp;P 500 Index was up 14.8% in the same period.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEarlier this month, Masimo’s W1 advanced health-tracking watch was chosen by one of Switzerland’s premier academic institutions — Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV) — for pre-surgical patient assessment research program in its Department of Anesthesiology.A key hospital authority believes that Masimo W1 watch will better inform anesthesiologists and surgical teams about their patients’ physiological status prior to surgery. The watch offers accurate, continuous measurements of key physiological parameters. It is available in Europe and comes integrated with the Masimo SafetyNet remote patient management platform.Story continuesThese deals reflect rising demand for digital and remote monitoring of patients. Although the digitization of healthcare has been gaining traction for past several years, it was spurred by the pandemic that put significant pressure on hospitals, leading to acceleration in remote monitoring of patients.Shortage of hospital staff also led caregivers to focus on remote monitoring. The benefits of digital and remote monitoring of patients are likely to generate more demand going forward, creating growth opportunities for companies like Masimo.Recent DevelopmentLast week, Masimo received FDA approval for its patient-worn, continuous multi-parameter vital signs monitor, Radius VSM, which is already available in Europe. Radius VSM is expected to combine the reliability and accuracy of larger bedside monitors with the comfort and freedom of a wearable device.

228,5fcc2a3e-bace-35b3-877c-5685d19e60a7,CMCSA,2023-06-16,"With 86% ownership of the shares, Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is heavily dominated by institutional owners",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/86-ownership-shares-comcast-corporation-120032217.html,1686916832,STORY,['CMCSA'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Comcast's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisionsA total of 19 investors have a majority stake in the company with 51% ownership Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a businessA look at the shareholders of Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 86% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Comcast. Check out our latest analysis for Comcast ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Comcast?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Comcast does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Comcast's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Comcast is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Capital Research and Management Company with 9.6% of shares outstanding. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 9.5% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 7.6% of the company stock. Furthermore, CEO Brian Roberts is the owner of 0.9% of the company's shares.A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 19 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of ComcastThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Comcast Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$1.6b worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 13% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Comcast. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Comcast better, we need to consider many other factors.

To skip our detailed analysis of the journalism industry, click 5 Biggest Journalism Companies in the US.The mass media industry has remained a crucial part of the global economy for centuries. Whether you are interested in the financial markets, politics, or entertainment, it is likely that much of your opinion on any of these subjects will be heavily influenced by the media you consume. In this manner, journalism is an essential tool in the arsenal of those who prioritize controlling public opinion. And while many are heralding the age of modern technology and the internet as the end of an era for traditional media, it would be premature to write off the companies that have survived in this space for so long.Adapting to a New EnvironmentWith the rise of the internet, companies in many industries began to see their operations being impacted. Those operating within the journalism sector were no different, considering they found themselves often outmaneuvered by social media platforms offering news and information in real-time to a global audience at lower costs. However, media companies have been fighting back. According to a PwC outlook report on the global entertainment and media industry between 2022 and 2026, while total global entertainment and media revenue fell by 2.3% in 2020, it also rose by 10.4% the very next year. Based on this growth, it was estimated that the industry would grow by 7.3% between 2022 and 2026, rising at a compound annual growth rate of 4.6%.This growth has been heavily attributed to the adaptation of media and journalism companies to the digital environment. With the COVID-19 pandemic in particular, most readers and audiences developed a greater interest in digital content, making this a new and largely untapped market for many traditional media companies. Identifying and exploiting this market is what is allowing many of these companies to retain their position in the economy. For example, according to an article published by the Reuters Institute this January, more publishers today are willing to pour resources into podcasts and digital audio, which have been useful in increasing brand loyalty for many news brands. Media and journalism companies are also beginning to integrate artificial intelligence into their products to offer personalized experiences to their audiences. Additionally, while print media seems to be going out of fashion, a trend expected through 2023 is that of traditional news media companies taking their print publications online to make them more accessible for their readers.Story continuesWhile the rapidly shifting environment is continuing to change the way most media companies operate, many other mass media and journalism companies, such as Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) are continuing to flourish with their original business models.

Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) also beat analyst estimates by $376.2 million in the fiscal first quarter, with its revenue of $29.7 billion. The performance of companies such as these is evidence of the resilience of the US media and journalism companies, whether because they are highly profitable behemoths in their industry or because they are especially adept at conforming to changing conditions and trends.

231,a521d273-7171-3bbe-8228-efc91c29cf36,CMCSA,2023-06-16,Comcast Corporation (CMCSA) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/comcast-corporation-cmcsa-trending-stock-130006488.html,1686834006,STORY,['CMCSA'],"[Comcast (CMCSA) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this cable provider have returned +1.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +6.2% change. The Zacks Cable Television industry, to which Comcast belongs, has lost 0.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Comcast is expected to post earnings of $1 per share, indicating a change of -1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.75 points to a change of +3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.12 indicates a change of +9.7% from what Comcast is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Comcast.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Comcast, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $30.29 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +0.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $120.67 billion and $123.52 billion estimates indicate -0.6% and +2.4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryComcast reported revenues of $29.69 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -4.3%. EPS of $0.92 for the same period compares with $0.86 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $29.23 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.59%. The EPS surprise was +15%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Comcast is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Comcast. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In conjunction with the refinancing, Pieridae will enter a new loan with Prudential Private Capital, the private capital arm of PGIM, the US$1.3 trillion global investment management business of Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE: PRU), and Voya Investment Management which manages approximately US$323 billion as of March 31, 2023.Proceeds from the refinancing will be used to fully repay the current outstanding debt of $185 million to funds managed, sub-advised, or operated by affiliates of Third Eye Capital. The term loan was originally provided to Pieridae in October 2019 and has produced a double-digit internal rate of return for the Funds.Through this repayment, the Ninepoint-TEC Private Credit Fund and Ninepoint-TEC Private Credit Fund II will receive their respective pro-rata share of collectively $123 million. The repayment to both funds will be made upon closing of the refinancing transaction and will provide significant liquidity to service their cash requirements and will position the Ninepoint-TEC Private Credit Fund II to continue to invest and grow. Since inception in 2010, the Ninepoint-TEC Private Credit strategy has produced an annualized net return of 10.33%.“The transaction is a prime example of the pivotal role private credit plays in the Canadian economy by helping to support and grow successful businesses that typically don’t have access to traditional lenders, like the Canadian banks,” said Ramesh Kashyap, Managing Director and Head of Ninepoint’s Alternative Income Group. “By focusing on senior secured loans positioned at the top of the capital structure, the Ninepoint-TEC Private Credit strategy has been able to deliver healthy, risk-adjusted returns to our investors all the while helping companies like Pieridae strategically support and scale their businesses.”Story continuesThird Eye Capital provided the senior secured term loan to Pieridae to help finance its purchase of Shell Canada Energy’s (“Shell”) midstream and upstream assets in the Southern Alberta Foothills in 2019. The transaction and term loan allowed Pieridae to retain more than 200 jobs for former Shell Canada employees. With the addition of these new employees, Pieridae has become a significant employer in the region with roughly 300 employees and has contributed millions of dollars to the local and Canadian economy. The integration of the Shell assets has enabled Pieridae to become the largest Foothills producer in North America, growing net operating income from $25 million in 2019 to $201 million in 2022.“The refinancing of Pieridae’s debt today is further evidence of the high quality investments that Third Eye Capital makes, which may be overlooked or underappreciated by others. It not only demonstrates our ability to identify hidden gems and capitalize on market inefficiencies, but also shows how our private credit strategy empowers our borrowers and their own employees, stakeholders, and local economies,” said Arif Bhalwani, Chief Executive Officer at Third Eye Capital.Third Eye Capital made the $200-million (net) loan to Pieridae in 2019 through Erikson National Energy Inc.

Through to today, Erikson has received $370 million in cash payments, comprising principal, interest and fees from the loan.

The company is expected to report EPS of $1.39, down 46.33% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $3.99 billion, down 29.07% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $6.14 per share and revenue of $16.11 billion, which would represent changes of -26.11% and -15.97%, respectively, from the prior year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Devon Energy. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Hayes says the payments company has a few things going for it, including an activist investor. Hayes also likes Generac ahead of the summer season. Hayes is less of a fan of Oracle and Eli Lilly due to the stocks' valuations.Video TranscriptDIANE KING HALL: There's a lot of uncertainty in the markets. Fed Chair Jerome Powell adding to that feeling after announcing a pause in interest rate hikes. Well, some of that uncertainty seems to be in the rear view mirror. Powell though, saying despite the pause in June, there may be more hikes ahead. Here to help manage some of the questions and give us some stock picks in this context is Tom Hayes, Great Hill Capital chairman and managing member. So let's start with your picks. You have a couple for us. I find both of them interesting. Let's start with the first pick.TOM HAYES: I'll tell you what, Diane. If I didn't shock you in the A block, I'm going to shock to you right now. So I've got two stocks that are down 80% off their 2021 peaks. And the first one is about as boring as boring gets.DIANE KING HALL: I know. I know what it is. Tell the people.TOM HAYES: This is the Kleenex of home standby generators. It's called Generac.BRAD SMITH: Riveting.TOM HAYES: And you know, Generac has a 75% share in this business. The problem is during COVID, they built up their inventories too much because they couldn't get parts. And it looks like in Q1 was the trough. So they're working through those inventories. They were at 1.7 times normal inventories. They got down to 1.4 times. They think they're going to be normalized by early in the second half. They're going to be cash flow-positive this year.And the thing about this company, first and foremost, because of the pessimism, they're trading at about 15 times their historic average multiples, about 30 times. So you're getting a huge discount in terms of the growth. And the runway ahead is monstrous. They only have 6% penetration. And you could say, well, you know, does it get saturated at some point? People don't buy two generators for their house.Story continuesWhat they find is in the top states where they have the most penetration above 10%, they consistently have the biggest growth rates because what happens is everyone has a generator, so everyone wants a generator. Whereas in the markets where they're under-penetrated, they say, well, none of my friends have a generator. So what do I need a generator for? This is going to continue. This company is could be over the next 12 to 24 months, we think, a double after being down 80%.DIANE KING HALL: And that's because of it being down 80%. So is this also just like a summer play because of, I don't know, potential for just demand, power outages, et cetera. Is that what is part of this?TOM HAYES: Diane, I'm going to bring you in as an analyst at our fund because you hit the nail on the head. This company does well on the basis of weather events, and we just entered hurricane season from June through September. You get the power outages. And by the way, our grid has been underinvested for so many years that what you're seeing is-- you know, when I was growing up, power outage was an hour, 30 minutes. Now in some cases, they're three days, four days, five days.DIANE KING HALL: Like Texas. Yeah.TOM HAYES: And when that happens-- even in Connecticut, it's crazy-- when that happens, everyone goes out and buys a generator. So we're expecting above average weather events for the next four months. And if that's the case, that's going to be a further tailwind for Generac. We're going to see some acceleration.With rates lower, we're going to see the housing market start to come back, Homebuilding come back. That helps Generac as well. So there's a lot of pent up demand with all the millennials, the young folks like you, 33, housing and family formation. You all are buying houses now that rates moderate. You're going to jump on that, you're going to want a generator, and that's what's going to come.DIANE KING HALL: He's the millennial. I'm Gen X.BRAD SMITH: You find me a bank that's going to give me a loan, Tom, we can talk. I also got to talk about PayPal, though. You talk about millennials. Of course, this is like the Venmo season, if you will. Summertime, you're out with your friends, you pay for this pizza, I'll hit you back with that money later on. Let's talk about PayPal here because that's one of your other picks on the day.TOM HAYES: Yeah. This is probably one of the most hated stocks right now. Again, down 80%. Look, they've got 435 million users around the world. That's mind-boggling. 3 billion transactions. So why is everyone all up in arms? Number one, obviously, they got ahead of themselves during COVID. The valuations were crazy.Right now, it's trading at 11 times forward earnings compared to its average historic multiple of 33 times. This thing is a monster. So what happened is they did this acquisition called Braintree. And Braintree really ramped up the volume, but their margins are lower because you don't have as much juice as you have on the normal PayPal transactions.So analysts got worried that you were having margin contraction, but you were having-- it's OK to have margin contraction as long as the bottom line keeps going up. And what they wanted, they wanted it to go up at a certain percentage all the time. I'll take tons of extra volume as long as the bottom line goes up. And that's going to continue to happen.You have two other things. Dan Schulman is stepping down before the end of the year. So you have leadership uncertainty. That will get resolved. They'll have someone good. And then you've got an activist also to catalyze with Elliott in the stock, Elliott Management. So they are good at extracting value. So I think there are a lot of things that can go right while everyone's looking at what can go wrong.DIANE KING HALL: Unless for lack of a better way of expressing it, what could go wrong plays that you have. The ones that, I guess, you're not a fan of. Let's start with Oracle, which surprised me. You're going against the grain here. I mean, it's up on the day, continuing to extend its advance. Explain your thinking here.TOM HAYES: OK. So Oracle and Lily-- I mean, you know, we're not short these stocks, so let's be clear about that. I don't think this is the time to be short aggressively anything. However, we like things that are on sale, we don't like things that are marked up. And we think that after Oracle's earnings, they're now trading about four turns above their average historic multiple.They usually trade at 18, they're trading 22. And we just say, OK, let this thing breathe. It's a great quality business, we get that their cloud is growing. But see if there's a pullback before you get interested. You don't need to chase it up here after earnings is our view.BRAD SMITH: Yeah. And then Lily as well, one of the other picks here, Eli Lilly. Similar, multiple issue, that you're taking?TOM HAYES: Yeah. It's certainly a multiple issue. It's trading at 51 times, I think, relative to its average of 25 times. And it's on the hype around Mounjaro.DIANE KING HALL: That's what I was going to say. I'm sorry to jump in. It has Mounjaro. Like how would you go against this? I mean, these weight loss drugs are all the craze right now.TOM HAYES: Yeah. There's no question. But obviously, they have competition for Ozempic and Wegovy. And the stock has moved up dramatically in anticipation of the approval for weight loss usage. Right now, it's being written off-label. But they want to get the weight loss usage. So two things can happen. Number one, you could get that approval and it's a sell-the-news because it's run up so much.Or number two, god forbid, which I think is very low probability, what if you didn't get that approval and it's already priced that in? So I think, again, I think the long term runway is certainly good, Diane. I agree with you. But I don't want to pay up two times it's average multiple. So for me, they're just a pass for now. It's not they're not great. They're both great businesses. But they're a little rich for me right now, just today.DIANE KING HALL: Understand. We need a sale. All right. We like that. We like a sale. All right, Tom Hayes, thanks to you so much for this great conversation today.TOM HAYES: Thank, Diane. Thanks, Brad. Appreciate i.]"

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Linde plc (LIN), S&amp;P Global Inc. (SPGI) and AT&amp;T Inc. (T). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Linde shares have outperformed the Zacks Chemical - Specialty industry (+29% vs. +13.7%) as well as the broader market (+29% vs. +19.3% for the S&amp;P 500) over the past year reflecting robust demand for its industrial gases. The company’s primary products in industrial gases include oxygen, which is used as life support in hospitals.Linde has long-term contracts with on-site customers backed by minimum purchase requirements, thereby securing stable cashflows. In the profitable industrial gas market, the merger of Praxair and Linde has created an efficient player with considerable size advantages.However, the cost of sales continues to increase, hurting the firm’s bottom line. Also, high leverage may limit its financial flexibility. The firm has mostly been paying a lower dividend yield than the industry’s composite stocks over the past two years.(You can read the full research report on Linde here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of S&amp;P Global have outperformed the Zacks Business - Information Services industry over the past year (+26.1% vs. +15.4%). The company remains well poised to gain from growing demand for business information services. Buyouts help innovate, increase differentiated content and develop new products.Effective management execution has helped it generate solid cash flow which is utilized for growth initiatives. Dividend payments and share buybacks boost investors confidence and positively impact earnings per share.However, S&amp;P Global remains vulnerable to proceedings, investigations and inquiries with respect to the ratings provided, leading to legal charges, damages or fines. Growth initiatives, higher compensations and incentives raise the company's expenses. Decreasing current ratio is not desirable as it indicates that the company may have problems meeting its short-term debt obligations.(You can read the full research report on S&amp;P Global here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of AT&amp;T have declined -11.4% over the past year against the Zacks Wireless National industry’s decline of -12.1%. The company is facing a steady decline in linear TV subscribers and legacy services. As the company tries to woo customers with healthy discounts, freebies and cash credits, margin pressures tend to escalate. This is likely to affect its growth potential to some extent. High debt burden is also worrisome.However, AT&amp;T is focused on business transformation efforts to augment operational efficiency and facilitate optimum resource utilization to enhance value and lower operating costs.A customer-centric business model alongside a lower churn rate and higher-tier unlimited plans is providing robust growth in its postpaid wireless business. An integrated fiber expansion strategy is expected to improve the broadband connectivity for both enterprise and consumer markets, while steady 5G deployments are likely to boost end-user experience.(You can read the full research report on AT&amp;T here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Oracle Corporation (ORCL), HCA Healthcare, Inc.

Yet, inorganic growth efforts are likely to keep expenses elevated.New Drugs Boost Bayer (BAYRY), Crop Science Faces ChallengesPer the Zacks analyst, new drugs like Nubeqa and Kerendia boost Bayer. However, Crop Science division is facing pricing challenges for glyphosate-based products which will impact performance.Edwards (EW) Rides on Solid TMTT Sales and Global ProspectsEdwards' strong TMTT sales globally is a major positive. Per the Zacks analyst, differentiated therapies, positive pivotal trial results and favorable real-world clinical outcomes are the key drivers.Investments Aid Sempra (SRE), Severe Weather Impact WoesPer the Zacks analyst, systematic investments boost Sempra's infrastructure. Yet, its operations are subject to severe weather which can materially increase costs, and impact its earnings.CrowdStrike (CRWD) Rides on Product Strengt, AcquisitionsPer the Zacks analyst, CrowdStrike is gaining from solid contributions of its growth-oriented products, primarily Falcon platform.

Betty Wu Mingxia, the recently appointed general manager of Micron China, said the deal would allow the US company to directly manage all chip packaging and testing operations.Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.Upon completion of the deal, which is expected to take a year and is subject to regulatory approval in China, Micron's total payroll in the country will increase to 4,500, by adding 1,200 workers from Powertech, Micron said.Taiwan-listed Powertech said the acquisition price would be based upon the book value of its operations, which ranges from US$50 million to US$60 million.Micron's plan to expand its Xian plant comes after the China Administration of Cybersecurity (CAC) barred critical information infrastructure providers from buying Micron's products, citing national security risks. The CAC launched a probe into Micron's products in late March, a move seen as China's reprisal against US sanctions on its technology firms.Beijing's ban could see a hit to Micron's revenue in the single digits, the company's management has said, as China contributes about 11 per cent of Micron's global sales. After Beijing's ruling, China's top server makers, including Inspur Group and Lenovo Group, asked their suppliers to suspend shipments of modules containing chips made by the US company, the South China Morning Post reported earlier.Story continuesChina's ban also has geopolitical implications, as Washington has reportedly asked Seoul to dissuade South Korean chip makers from filling any market gaps in China.Meanwhile, Micron's US$600 million spending in Xian pales in comparison with its plans in Japan, where the company said it would invest US$3.6 billion over the next few years in next-generation memory chip fabs.A Micron SSD is displayed at Computex Taipei, Taiwan May 30, 2023.

Photo: Reuters&gt;However, packaging and testing are relatively low-end and low-margin operations compared with wafer fabrication. In 2014, Micron reached an outsourcing deal with Powertech for chip packaging and testing at the Xian plant, under which Micron owns the land and buildings while the Taiwan firm owned the equipment and provided the workers.The outsourcing deal ended in April 2022, but both sides agreed to renew it on a quarterly basis, according to Powertech last year. Micron's acquisition will allow Powertech to cash out from the Xian operations.Powertech chairman DK Tsai was quoted by Taiwanese media earlier this year as saying Taiwanese semiconductor companies are considering pulling out of mainland China due to geopolitical tensions.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

Additionally, each of these stocks have high Zacks Ranks, suggesting strong near-term expectations for their stocks.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMcDonald’sMcDonald’s is a leading fast-food chain that currently operates more than 39,000 restaurants in more than 100 countries. The company mainly operates and franchises quick-service restaurants (QSRs) under the McDonald’s brand.Nearly 93% of the company’s restaurants worldwide are owned and operated by independent local businesspeople. MCD’s revenues include sales by company-operated restaurants but primarily come in the form of franchise fees from the independently managed restaurants.Earnings have grown at a very stable and impressive rate from just $1.40 per share in 1999 to $10.45 per share today. That’s a CAGR of 8%. Because of its business model, MCD essentially charges rent to its restaurant owners and collects a franchise fee. This has been a very successful and enduring strategy.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMcDonald's currently boasts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Current quarter earnings have been revised higher by 4% and are expected to grow 8% YoY. FY23 earnings have been upgraded by 5% and are projected to grow 9.3% YoY.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAdobeAdobe is one of the largest software companies in the world collecting licensing fees from customers, which form the bulk of its revenue. ADBE also offers technical support and education, which accounts for the balance.Story continuesNot only have ADBE earnings grown steadily, but they have accelerated considerably in the last decade, forming the always desirable hockey stick chart. Adobe’s EPS have compounded at a ridiculous 14.4% annually over the last 25 years and its stock has appreciated over 9,000% over that period.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAdobe currently enjoys a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) reflecting upward trending earnings revisions. EPS is expected to grow 13.3% annually over the 3-5 years, in line with its long-term average, which is remarkable considering how large a company it is today.ADBE is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 39x, which is just above the industry average of 33x, and a bit above its 25-year median of 34x.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPepsiCoPepsiCo is one of the leading global food and beverage companies. Its complementary brands include Frito-Lay snacks, Pepsi-Cola beverages, Gatorade sports drinks, Tropicana juices and Quaker foods. The company serves customers in more than 200 countries and territories.Earnings growth in PEP is about the smoothest up trending line in finance that I have seen. Over the last 25 years annual EPS have grown from $1.21 per share to $7.00 per share, which is a CAGR of 7.3%.Additionally, over the last 20 years, PEP has reduced its share count by 20% through persistent share buyback programs. This has further ensured upward movement in the stock.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMaking PepsiCo an even more compelling investment is its generous dividend, which yields 2.8%. Pepsi has increased its dividend every single year for the last 50 years, making it one of the very prestigious dividend king stocks. Over the last five years the dividend has been increased by 5.4% annually.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchProcter and GambleProcter &amp; Gamble is a multinational consumer goods behemoth that has established itself as a global leader in its industry.

Current quarter earnings are projected to grow 9% YoY, while sales are projected to grow 2.3% over the same period. FY23 earnings are expected to increase just 1% YoY, however FY24 is expected to resume growth, with estimates of an 8.3% YoY increase.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIf consistently growing earnings wasn’t enough to guarantee stock appreciation PG also has the strong tendency to return huge amounts of cash to shareholders. Though stock buybacks management has decreased share count by 17% over the last 15 years.Furthermore, the company offers a dividend yield of 2.6%, which it has increased by an average of 6.3% annually over the last five years. Procter and Gamble has paid a dividend for 132 years and has increased the dividend payment consecutively for 66 years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineInvesting in stocks with a long-term trend of growing earnings per share can be a prudent strategy for investors seeking sustainable growth in their portfolios.

263,cfa9eecf-2f1f-325d-b332-230001aba2b9,UPS,2023-06-16,"At US$179, Is United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) Worth Looking At Closely?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-179-united-parcel-inc-110026902.html,1686913226,STORY,['UPS'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS). The company's stock saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$196 and falling to the lows of US$167. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether United Parcel Service's current trading price of US$179 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at United Parcel Service’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for United Parcel Service What's The Opportunity In United Parcel Service?United Parcel Service appears to be overvalued by 22% at the moment, based on my discounted cash flow valuation. The stock is currently priced at US$179 on the market compared to my intrinsic value of $147.16. Not the best news for investors looking to buy! If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Since United Parcel Service’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.Can we expect growth from United Parcel Service?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. However, with a negative profit growth of -0.5% expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth certainly doesn’t appear to be a driver for a buy decision for United Parcel Service. This certainty tips the risk-return scale towards higher risk.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? If you believe UPS is currently trading above its value, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. Given the uncertainty from negative growth in the future, this could be the right time to de-risk your portfolio. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on UPS for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. you may want to reconsider buying the stock at this time. Its price has risen beyond its true value, on top of a negative future outlook. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Should the price fall in the future, will you be well-informed enough to buy?Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved.

264,9a10d796-dff5-3373-a96f-d0098e2e7767,UPS,2023-06-16,Will cost cuts help FedEx close margin gap with UPS?,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cost-cuts-help-fedex-close-103935484.html,1686911975,STORY,"['FDX', 'UPS']","[By Priyamvada C(Reuters) - FedEx may see a profit boost from cost cuts undertaken last year, although its investors will be keen on knowing whether those actions have helped it catch up with rival United Parcel Service on the margin front.The global shipping downturn has been a drag on margins for most operators in the sector as the boom during the pandemic deflates, while high inflation and worries of a recession threaten consumer spending.To avoid a hit to its margins from an industry-wide slowdown, FedEx embarked on a cost-cutting drive in September by shuttering offices, cutting jobs, reducing its fleet of cargo planes and cancelling profit-sapping Sunday deliveries in far-flung areas.""We believe this (cost cuts) will narrow the margin and valuation disparity to UPS,"" Atlantic Equities analyst Oliver Holmes said, adding that FedEx's cost-cutting efforts will go a long way in helping the company improve its margins.FedEx's operating expenses are expected to fall to $20.81 billion for the fourth quarter from $21.13 billion in the prior three-month period when it reports on Tuesday, according to Refinitiv data. UPS reported operating expenses of $20.38 billion in its latest quarter.On the margin front, however, FedEx has widely lagged UPS, making the Memphis, Tennessee-based company a target of activist investors.For their latest quarters, FedEx posted a net profit margin of 3.48%, while UPS reported 8.27%. The two companies have different fiscal years.To further shore up its margins following pressure from an investor, FedEx in April said it would consolidate its separate delivery companies into a single entity - a move some experts see as an opportunity to shrink labor costs.""It has the potential to further reduce headcount by about 2,000-3,000 jobs in the next two months,"" said industry consultant Satish Jindel, who helped found the contractor-based company that FedEx bought to compete with UPS on home delivery.Story continuesHistorically, FedEx's main rival has done a better job of keeping a lid on costs, despite having a more expensive unionized workforce.Expenses are not the only thing that FedEx is contending with, analysts say. They believe the delivery giant has more exposure to weakness in the ""express"" air shipment category than UPS, which is more dependent on the so-called ground shipments favored by online retailers and other shippers.""This dynamic has provided greater organic growth opportunities for UPS as ground market growth has outpaced air,"" Holmes said.FedEx is expected to report a per-share profit for the fourth quarter of $4.89 on an adjusted basis, compared with $6.87 a year earlier, as per Refinitiv data. It is estimated to post a 6.9% fall in quarterly revenue to $22.72 billion.""(FedEx's fiscal) Q4 trended slightly weaker overall for airfreight pricing and consumer demand,"" said Baird Equity Research analyst Garrett Holland, after lowering FedEx's profit estimate on softer demand through the quarter.(Reporting by Priyamvada C in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva)]"

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 65% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of American Express. Check out our latest analysis for American Express ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About American Express?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that American Express does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at American Express' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. American Express is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Berkshire Hathaway Inc. with 20% of shares outstanding. With 6.4% and 6.2% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and BlackRock, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.After doing some more digging, we found that the top 13 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of American ExpressThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of American Express Company in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$176m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 15% stake in American Express. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Public Company OwnershipPublic companies currently own 20% of American Express stock. We can't be certain but it is quite possible this is a strategic stake. The businesses may be similar, or work together.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand American Express better, we need to consider many other factors.Many find it useful to take an in depth look at how a company has performed in the past.

With the launch of the SmileMaker Platform in the U.S. market and the rollout of the CarePlus offering, the company’s successful investments in innovations buoy optimism. The gross margin expansion in the first quarter is encouraging.However, operating in a tough competitive space amid continued macroeconomic headwinds is concerning.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has decreased 63.6% against the 19.7% growth of the industry and a 17.3% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned oral care company has a market capitalization of $161.4 million. SDC projects a long-term estimated earnings growth rate of 20.3%, ahead of the industry’s expected growth rate of 11.6%. SmileDirectClub delivered an average negative earnings surprise of 0.81% in the trailing four quarters.Let’s delve deeper.Factors at PlayInnovations Aid Growth: In May 2023, SmileDirectClub announced the launch of its innovative SMP in the United States, expanding its patented technology to its largest market. The technology is an industry first, upgrading current 2D remote scanning options and introducing real-time AI to capture a 3D view of teeth.Earlier in February, SDC launched its new premium aligner treatment, CarePlus which is presently available at select Partner Network dentist locations. The company also announced the addition of a new Sensitivity-Free Whitening Kit to its innovative suite of premium, affordable oral care products.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStrategic Alliances Add Value: In terms of retail partnerships, SmileDirectClub’s oral care products are now available at more than 12,500 retail stores nationwide, including Walmart, CVS, Walgreens, and Sam's Club. In the first quarter, SDC introduced sales specialists in targeted partner network practices to better educate customers about the differences between its two service offerings, CarePlus and traditional virtual care offering.Story continuesLong-Term Growth Targets: SmileDirectClub’s long-term strategy includes achieving the average revenue growth target of 20%-30% per year and adjusted EBITDA margins of 25%-30% for the next five years. This implies a long-term target on a sequential basis of 5% -7% each quarter. Per the company, this long-term revenue target reflects the efforts to capture market share while improving customer experience.For 2023, SmileDirectClub expects total core business revenues in the range of $400-$450 million. SDC’s revenues in the first quarter of 2023 were well ahead of estimates.DownsidesQ1 Negatives: The company posted a year-over-year decline in revenues due to persistent macroeconomic headwinds, driven by high inflation that impacted its customer base. Earnings for the quarter missed estimates. Meanwhile, the operating loss trend continued, with the company posting a narrower loss in the first quarter, than the year-ago adjusted figure.A Tough Competitive Landscape: SmileDirectClub competes with a handful of smaller companies that collectively have a limited market share in the clear aligner industry, including Candid Co., Byte (Dentsply) and SnapCorrect. Following the introduction of the company’s collaborative and wholesale partner network, it also faces competition from more well-established competitors in the traditional orthodontic industry, which requires in-person visits, such as Align Technology, Inc.Estimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for SmileDirectClub’s 2023 loss per share has remained constant at 42 cents in the past 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $433.9 million.

But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Occidental Petroleum's  ROE today.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. Check out our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Occidental Petroleum is:32% = US$9.7b ÷ US$30b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.32 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.A Side By Side comparison of Occidental Petroleum's Earnings Growth And 32% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that Occidental Petroleum has a significantly high ROE. Additionally, a comparison with the average industry ROE of 32% also portrays the company's ROE in a good light. So, Occidental Petroleum's moderate 19% growth over the past five years was probably backed by the high ROE.Story continuesWe then performed a comparison between Occidental Petroleum's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 22% in the same 5-year period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for OXY? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Occidental Petroleum Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Occidental Petroleum's LTM (or last twelve month) payout ratio to shareholders is 6.0% (implying that it retains 94% of its income), which is on the lower side, so it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business.Besides, Occidental Petroleum has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Looking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 16% over the next three years. Consequently, the higher expected payout ratio explains the decline in the company's expected ROE (to 18%) over the same period.SummaryOverall, we are quite pleased with Occidental Petroleum's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. With that said, on studying the latest analyst forecasts, we found that while the company has seen growth in its past earnings, analysts expect its future earnings to shrink.

PDCO is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its broad product line. The optimism led by a solid third-quarter fiscal 2023 performance and a few notable acquisitions are expected to contribute further. Integration risks and stiff competitive forces persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 4.2% against the 18% rise of the industry and the S&amp;P 500’s 15.5% growth.The renowned global dental and animal health company has a market capitalization of $2.65 billion. The company projects 7.2% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. Patterson Companies’ earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, delivering a surprise of 6.2%, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Broad Product Spectrum: We are optimistic about Patterson Companies’ wide range of consumable supplies, equipment and software, and value-added services. A notable offering from the company is a private-label brand named Pivotal, while it continues adding stock keeping units to its broader private-label portfolio. Patterson Companies’ NaVetor is an integrated cloud-based veterinary practice management software for its Animal Health segment.Acquisitions: We are upbeat about Patterson Companies’ strategy of expanding its business via strategic acquisitions. In January, it announced that it had, through subsidiaries, completed the previously-announced acquisition of substantially all the assets of Relief Services for Veterinary Practitioners and Animal Care Technologies.In December 2022, Patterson Companies announced that it had, through a subsidiary, closed the previously announced acquisition of substantially all the assets of Dairy Tech, Inc.Strong Q3 Results: Patterson Companies’ better-than-expected earnings in third-quarter fiscal 2023 results buoy optimism. Strength in the overall top line, Value-added Services and Other business of the Dental segment and the overall Animal Health segment was witnessed. The gross margin expansion bodes well for the company. Prudent cost-saving initiatives and solid sales execution continue to favor Patterson Companies.Story continuesDownsidesStiff Competition: The U.S. dental products distribution industry is highly competitive and consists chiefly of national, regional and local full-service and mail-order distributors. Patterson Companies needs to continue to introduce newer products in the market to withstand competitive pressures. Failure to do so can dilute the company’s market share.Integration Risks: Patterson Companies has been on an acquisition spree which is improving its revenue opportunities, but is aggravating integration risks. Regular acquisitions are also a distraction for management which is likely to impact organic growth. This may limit Patterson Companies’ future expansion and worsen the company’s risk profile, going forward.Estimate TrendPatterson Companies is witnessing a flat estimate revision trend for fiscal 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has remained stable at $2.28.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $1.66 billion, suggesting a 1.1% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

HOLX is gaining from continued strength in GYN Surgical and Breast Health businesses. The company’s focus on international operations is encouraging. Strong solvency is an added advantage. However, stiff competition and currency headwinds do not bode well.In the past six months, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has gained 16.5% compared with a 17.9% growth of the industry and a 21.4% rise of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned medical device company has a market capitalization of $19.29 billion. Its earnings in second-quarter fiscal 2023 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 20.5%.Let’s delve deeper.Factors at PlayStrength in GYN Surgical: Over the past few years, the GYN Surgical business has transformed to the most profitable division of Hologic on a percentage basis. It is banking on new leadership, strong strategic execution of new commercial models and new product launches.In second quarter, GYN Surgical grew more than 25% driven by strong contributions from hysteroscopic portfolio of MyoSure, the Fluent Fluid Management System and NovaSure. HOLX is encouraged by yet another strong quarter for its latest NovaSure iteration, NovaSure V5. The laparoscopic portfolio continues to build momentum and is growing into a larger driver for the division.Strength in Breast Health: Hologic has been making impressive progress in its Breast Health arm in recent time. The company is currently focusing on expanding its strategy to diversify business across the patient continuum of care. It has also launched new software products based on its investments in artificial intelligence and has strengthened its interventional franchise via Brevera relaunch.During fiscal second quarter, the Breast Health segment returned to growth, posting 25.7% rise.Focus on International Operations: According to Hologic, global expansion will be a critical element of its growth strategy over the long term. While many of its best-in-class products command a leading share in the domestic market, they hold a disproportionately low market share internationally, indicating huge untapped potential.Story continuesHOLX’s international sales have been a major catalyst over the past three years with the molecular diagnostics business being a significant driver. Hologic is increasingly focusing on commercial infrastructure. It has been progressing impressively with respect to the placement of Panther instruments across the globe.Strong Solvency and Capital Structure: Hologic ended second-quarter fiscal 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $2.58 billion compared with $2.34 billion at the end of first-quarter fiscal 2023. Total long-term debt (including the current portion) was $2.79 billion at fiscal second-quarter end compared with $2.80 billion at the end of fiscal first quarter.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAlthough the quarter’s total debt was higher than the cash and cash equivalent level, we may note that Hologic has a short-term payable debt of $26 million on its balance sheet. This can be treated as a positive for HOLX amid the ongoing economic downturn, as it is holding sufficient cash for debt repayment.DownsidesForeign Exchange Headwinds: We remain worried about the significant challenges Hologic has been facing due to unfavorable foreign currency impact. This has been affecting HOLX’s overall performance in the past few quarters.Competitive Landscape: Hologic operates in a highly competitive industry. Its mammography, related products and subsystems compete on a worldwide basis with products offered by a number of competitors including General Electric Company, Siemens, Koninklijke Philips NV or Philips, Planmed Oy or Planmed, Agfa-Gevaert N.V.or Agfa, Carestream Health, Inc., FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation or Fuji, I.M.S. and Toshiba Corporation.Estimate TrendsIn the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Hologic’s fiscal 2023 earnings has been moved 3.9% north to $3.89 per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HOLX’s fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $4.01 billion, suggesting a 17.6% fall from the year-ago reported number.Other Stocks to ConsiderA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Merit Medical Systems, Inc.

At Norfolk Southern, everything we do starts with safety. This National Safety Month, we're sharing a few ways the public can keep safety in mind as well,"" said John Fleps, Vice President Safety at Norfolk Southern. ""Across our country, millions of people live within a mile radius of active rail lines. So, remember to stay alert, keep your eyes and ears open, and always keep a safe distance from the tracks.""The nation's freight rail network is nearly 140,000-miles long. Thanks largely to infrastructure improvements, training, and technology upgrades over the last decade, accidents and incidents on freight railroad tracks are at an all-time low. But the rails are never a place to walk or play, no matter how safe they may appear.The public can help stay safe by remembering five easy tips:Tracks are never a safe place to walk, so keep a safe distance.The only safe place to cross a track is at a designated public crossing with a crossbuck, flashing red lights, or a gate.After looking and listening to determine a train is not approaching, cross tracks quickly, without stopping, at a 90-degree angle, especially when on a bike or with a stroller.Trains are wider than the tracks, so always stay at least 15 feet back.Do not listen to music or look at your phone when crossing tracks.About Norfolk SouthernSince 1827, Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE: NSC) and its predecessor companies have safely moved the goods and materials that drive the U.S. economy. Today, it operates a customer-centric and operations-driven freight transportation network.

One way to take advantage is to buy the best forever stocks that will grow sales and earnings for decades. Typically, these stocks have wide moats and durable brands that protect them against competition. Also, they have a proven record of sustaining their profits through economic cycles, outperforming the market.So, how do you identify the best forever stocks to buy? First, they sell everyday products or services with minimal disruption risks. While technology might improve their operations, it doesn’t pose risks of obsoleting their products. For instance, confectioners delight their customers with chocolates. AI won’t change customers’ preferences for their trusted tasty products.Secondly, these stocks benefit from the Lindy effect, a principle popularized by statistician Nicholas Taleb. It states that the longer a product has been in use, the longer its future life expectancy. Usually, top forever stocks sell products that have been in the market for decades. This longevity assists in capturing consumer mind share and developing crucial business relationships.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFinally, these long-term investment stocks have impenetrable moats making them profit machines with robust cash flows. Like clockwork, they reinvest their surplus cash flows into research, talent, supply chains, and market distribution. With each investment, they gradually strengthen their product quality, enhance their network effects and boost economies of scale. As a result, they end up in monopolies or duopolies with limited competition to disrupt their businesses.So, here are some blue-chip forever stocks that have endured recessions, wars, and political turmoil. Due to their utility-like products and strong customer loyalty, they will likely thrive for decades.Hershey (HSY)Hershey's milk chocolate pieces on a white plate on top of a wooden tableSource: shutterstock.com/VG FotoIf you are a chocolate fan, you have certainly come across Hershey’s (NYSE:HSY) products. Alongside Mars, these two giants dominate the North American confectionery market. Since its founding in 1927, Hershey has delighted its customers with products like Hershey’s, Reese’s, and Kisses.Story continuesWhether in an economic crisis or pandemic, consumers always crave a taste of their favorite chocolate bars. And every Halloween season, kids engage in the curious hunt for tasty treats creating a lasting brand connection. Consumers’ strong affinity for Hershey’s chocolate products and other snacks has made it a staple in most households.These consumer habits have driven revenue growth for decades allowing the company to reinvest and bring new and better products to market. In the U.S. market, the company is the leader in market share at 33.5%. Also, it has recently diversified into cheese puffs, pretzels, and popcorn through several acquisitions.After years of consistent growth, Hershey has grown into a behemoth with annual revenues of $10.4 billion. In the last five years, revenues increased at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7%. Meanwhile, diluted EPS grew at a 15.82% CAGR in the previous three years.Despite its size, Hershey is still one of the top high-potential forever stocks to buy. Notably, Hershey is still growing sales volume organically. While other packaged food companies relied on price increases for growth in the last quarter as volumes declined, Hershey bucked the trend. Management announced organic volume growth of 3.3%.Yes, chocolate seems boring compared to tech stocks in AI or the cloud. But sometimes, in investing, keeping it simple wins. People aren’t going to stop consuming chocolate. That’s why it has been one of the best forever stocks returning 178% in the last five years.Waste Management (WM)person depositing a plastic water bottle in a yellow plastic recycling bin. The bin is in a line-up of several other blue and green bins.Source: shutterstock.com/PhotoByToRGarbage collection is an essential utility that consumers and governments always need. And with the proliferation of consumerism and e-commerce, the amount of waste has only increased. Waste Management (NYSE:WM) serves the waste collection, disposal, and recycling market, making it one of the best forever stocks to buy now.The Houston, Texas-based company is the largest garbage collection company in America. It owns or operates over 259 landfill sites in U.S. and Canada. The company has expanded its presence in North America through bolt-on acquisitions. For instance, its $4.6 billion acquisition of Advanced Disposal in 2020 added 41 landfills and 3 million customers.So, why is Waste Management a forever stock to buy? First, the numerous regulatory hurdles make trash hauling a defensible business with limited competition. Obtaining permits and environmental approvals for a new landfill takes a lot of work. After all, nobody wants a landfill in their backyard. Due to these regulatory and political obstacles, Waste Management’s existing landfills are an irreplaceable asset.Secondly, it has strong pricing power because 60% of its contracts have provisions for price increases. Thirdly, the company owns its landfills. 70% of the waste it collects is disposed of on its landfill sites. As a result of this vertical integration, the company derives higher operating and profit margins.Given the essential nature of garbage collection and disposal, the substantial barriers to entry, and higher profit margins, WM stock is one of the top forever stocks to buy. And TipRanks analysts agree with an average price target of $174.78.PepsiCo (PEP)Cans of PepsiCo's Pepsi soda are in a bucket of ice.Source: suriyachan / Shutterstock.comSnacks are an indispensable part of the family diet. No other company dominates the category like PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP). In FY2022, its snacks business accounted for 58% of revenues. Complementing the snacks business is an equally robust global beverage business.Since it dominates the convenience foods category, PepsiCo’s snacks business is a stable growth driver. It is the market leader and brought in $50 billion in revenues in FY2022. The business includes brands such as Lay’s, Doritos, Tostitos, Ruffles, Cheetos Aunt Jemima, Cap’n Crunch, and Quaker Oatmeal.In terms of the carbonated soft drink business, it’s the second largest player behind Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). Essentially, these two operate as a duopoly. And although PepsiCo is the smaller player, it has led in many markets powered by drinks such as Pepsi, Mountain Dew, and Gatorade.Despite the strength of its brands and the breadth of its portfolio, PepsiCo is accelerating investments in its brands. As management highlighted in CAGNY 2023 conference, they have increased advertising and marketing by 24% in the last four years. Additionally, they have increased capital investment in capacity and supply chain, digital solutions, and go-to-market strategies.Due to these investments, PepsiCo has compounded revenues at 8.9% over the last three years. First quarter 2023 results were equally impressive, showing 14.3% organic revenue growth. Frito Lay North America had an astounding performance registering $5.5 billion in sales, a 16% YOY organic growth. It’s no surprise that analysts consider PepsiCo as one of the best forever stocks to buy.PepsiCo is a meaty forever business due to its number one position in snacks and duopoly in soft drinks. Besides, its global scale allows it to wring out numerous operating efficiencies. Finally, as my colleague Will Ashworth recently noted, it’s a dividend aristocrat that will keep rewarding shareholders from its increasing cash flows.On the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The jump came on an impressive volume with a higher-than-average number of shares changing hands in the session. This compares to the stock's 1.5% loss over the past four weeks.The upside in Stryker shares can mostly be attributed to rally in medical-devices stocks following positive commentary on potential rise in demand for surgeries by UnitedHealth executives.This medical device maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.38 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +5.8%. Revenues are expected to be $4.82 billion, up 7.2% from the year-ago quarter.Earnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.For Stryker, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised marginally lower over the last 30 days to the current level. And a negative trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't usually translate into price appreciation. So, make sure to keep an eye on SYK going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road.The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Also, digital innovation and expansion efforts bode well.Shares of ACM have gained 40.7% in the past year compared with the Zacks Engineering - R and D Services industry’s rise of 27.6%. Earnings estimates for 2023 have increased to $3.70 per share from $3.67 per share in the past 60 days. This depicts analysts' optimism over the company’s growth prospects.However, persisting macroeconomic risks and the cyclical nature of its business are potential headwinds.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGrowth DriversAECOM is witnessing robust prospects in all its segments. The company’s net service revenues or NSR for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 increased 7%, marking the ninth consecutive quarter of accelerating organic growth. NSR — defined as revenues excluding subcontractor and other direct costs — have been benefiting from strength across core transportation, water and environment markets. The total backlog increased to $41.98 billion (including 12% growth in the design business) from $40.8 billion in the prior-year quarter.The company has a good visibility of strong backlog and pipelines for the upcoming quarters.  Based on clients' strengthening funding backdrop, including benefits from the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill in the United States, AECOM expects the backlog to continue to grow. Overall, the company’s performance demonstrates that it has been outgrowing the industry organically and capturing market share.AECOM has been benefiting from solid infrastructure spending in the U.K., Canada, Hong Kong and Australia. Owing to the improvement in the global economic scenario, the company is expecting better infrastructural prospects in the international market. The International segment’s backlog at the end of second-quarter fiscal 2023 increased 9.7% year over year, reflecting market share gains and growth visibility.Digital AECOM, the company’s digital brand, with a portfolio of products that serve clients on their digital transformations, will be a key contributor toward achieving a 15% adjusted operating margin target in 2024. For fiscal 2023, it expects the metric to rise 40 bps year over year.ACM recently developed and unveiled a proprietary IIJA-specific digital tool as part of the digital AECOM offering, built organically by company experts in response to urgent demand from clients to best position their projects for IIJA funding. In addition, AECOM recently entered into a partnership with Microsoft to leverage its leading cloud technology and further enhance the PlanEngage offering. PlanEngage is now being promoted by Microsoft, creating another channel from which AECOM can deliver innovation to the marketplace.Story continuesHeadwindsThe demand for AECOM’s services is cyclical. Hence, it is largely vulnerable to reduction in government and private industrial spending. If economic conditions remain uncertain/weak and government spending is reduced, the company’s revenues and profitability could be adversely affected. Moreover, as the company operates across multiple geographies, factors like changes in the United States and other national governments’ trade policies, regulatory practices, tariffs and taxes, further devaluations and other conversion restrictions and logistical &amp; communication challenges might adversely impact the company’s financials.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksAECOM currently sports a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks from the Zacks Construction sector are: Dycom Industries, Inc.

297,6f593168-3a1f-32ff-a757-9f23f00b30eb,GE,2023-06-16,Top 16 Defense Contractors in the World in 2023,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-16-defense-contractors-world-211234990.html,1686863554,STORY,"['LMT', 'NOC', 'GE', 'LHX', 'BA', 'RTX']","[In this article, we look at the top 16 defense contractors in the world in 2023. To skip our detailed analysis of the defense sector, you can head directly to the Top 5 Defense Contractors in the World in 2023.Global military expenditure has grown by 19% since 2013 to reach a record high of $2,240 billion in 2022 – which accounts for 2.2% of the world’s gross domestic product (GDP). Much of last year’s defense spending was driven by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with Europe witnessing its steepest rise in the post-cold war era, with an increase of 13% compared to 2021. The Middle East experienced a growth of 3.2% on defense spending, as Saudi Arabia returned to the list of the world’s top five military spenders, having spent $75 billion that year. These staggering numbers were released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) in its 2022 report.Largest Defense ContractorsAccording to The Business Research Company, the global defense market has grown from $535 billion to $577 billion between 2022 and 2023 – a CAGR growth of 7.9%. The boom is likely to continue with the industry size expected to cross $700 billion by 2027. Some major beneficiaries of the surge in defense expenditures include companies like Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) whose operating profits increased by 9% between 2021 and 2022. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) was awarded contracts by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) worth $45.68 billion in 2022 – which made up for nearly 70% of its annual revenue.The China North Industries Group Corporation Limited, and the Aviation Industry Corporation of China, also known as AVIC, are also among the prime contractors that profited from the increased spending in the previous year. China is the world’s second biggest military spender after the United States, and much of its armaments are sourced from industries at home. In 2022, Beijing spent an estimated $292 billion on defense expenditure, according to SIPRI.Story continuesIn the United States, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) topped the charts as the largest federal defense contractor, having received over 11% of all spending by the DoD in 2022. This did not only include expenditure incurred on the U.S. military, but also contracts to aid the Ukrainian military against Russian advances. By December, the company had received missile orders worth $950 billion from Pentagon to refill stockpiles in Ukraine, with great focus on the production of HIMARS. These rocket launchers have proven instrumental in turning the tide in the conflict against Russia.Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) was followed by Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) at second spot, winning 6.1% of all defense-related contracts of the U.S. government. In September 2022, Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) was awarded a $985 million order from the U.S. Air Force to develop scramjet-powered hypersonic cruise missiles.The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is another top contractor for the U.S. Department of Defense. In 2022, it received total orders from the DoD worth over $14.7 billion, which included a $2.21 billion contract for its KC-46A Pegasus aircrafts. General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) claimed fourth and fifth positions, respectively, in the list of the top five defense contractors in the United States in terms of overall revenue in 2022. The US is also highly regarded for having the best defense industry in the world.Since the advent of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, priorities of the western world appear to have shifted from the global war on terror and now seem reminiscent of the Cold War era. Finland has joined NATO as its 31st member. Sweden has also applied for membership and is on the brink of receiving it. At least seven members are exceeding NATO’s defense expenditure goal of 2% of the GDP, with others taking urgent measures to increase their military spending and meet the target. You can read more about this in our article, NATO Military Spending by Country: Top 20 Countries.MethodologyWe have used two weighted metrics to rank the top 16 defense contractors in the world. These are 2022 annual revenues of firms that are in the defense industry, and the monetary value of the contracts they have received from the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) during 2022. 30% of weightage was assigned to annual revenue, while 70% to DoD contracts. The United States is the biggest military spender in the world and accounts for nearly 40% of all defense expenditure globally.It is also home to some of the largest aerospace and armaments manufacturing companies that meet modern military procurement needs of militaries around the world with new sophisticated weapons. Therefore, DoD contracts were assigned a greater weightage while creating this list than revenue volumes.For information on DoD contracts, we have used data from USASpending.gov. There was no public data available on Chinese defense companies' contracts with their own or foreign governments. They have been highlighted as biggest contractors based on reports that link them to the People's Liberation Army (PLA). We have used their revenues as a proxy for their contractual magnitude.Top 16 Defense Contractors in the World in 2023Everett Historical / shutterstock.comHere are the top 16 defense contractors in the world in 2023:16.

298,9388319b-a2b1-3dd9-b044-894d3a8a8101,GE,2023-06-16,General Electric Company (GE) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-electric-company-ge-trending-130014286.html,1686834014,STORY,['GE'],"[General Electric (GE) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this industrial conglomerate have returned +1.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +6.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Diversified Operations industry, which GE falls in, has gained 4.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, GE is expected to post earnings of $0.45 per share, indicating a change of -42.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.03 points to a change of -22.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.90 indicates a change of +92.3% from what GE is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.3%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for GE.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of GE, the consensus sales estimate of $15.03 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -19.4%. The $62.19 billion and $67.6 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -18.8% and +8.7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryGE reported revenues of $14.49 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -15%. EPS of $0.27 for the same period compares with $0.24 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.45 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.69%. The EPS surprise was +107.69%.Over the last four quarters, GE surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.GE is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about GE. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group What's The Estimated Valuation?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$28.4bUS$28.0bUS$30.3bUS$34.5bUS$34.7bUS$35.0bUS$35.5bUS$36.0bUS$36.6bUS$37.3bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x6Analyst x3Analyst x3Analyst x2Est @ 0.94%Est @ 1.29%Est @ 1.54%Est @ 1.71%Est @ 1.83% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% US$26.6kUS$24.5kUS$24.8kUS$26.5kUS$24.9kUS$23.5kUS$22.3kUS$21.2kUS$20.2kUS$19.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$234bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$37b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.1%) = US$801bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$801b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$413bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$646b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$466, the company appears quite good value at a 33% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at UnitedHealth Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for UnitedHealth GroupStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Healthcare market.OpportunityAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

Yahoo Finance Health Care Reporter Anjalee Khemlani breaks down what it means for health insurers and health care stocks.Video Transcript- Well, the hospital sector getting a boost as a new survey shows revenue is growing in the post-pandemic environment. Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani is here with the details. Hey, Anj.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Hey. So, yeah, actually really good news. And this is coming off of some news yesterday that the health insurer UnitedHealth care was looking at an increase in outpatient utilization. And that is good news for the hospitals that obviously have been suffering throughout the pandemic with a lot of their operations really curtailed or shut down as a result of all the safety procedures and the overwhelming use of critical areas for COVID-19.So what we see now is a note from Cowen saying that ""Two of the last three months--"" that's March and May-- ""Reflect the highest calendar adjusted figures in their survey since December 2021."" And if you look at that graph, it is basically like peak valley, peak valley starting with the valley in 2020 when things really bottomed out, a little bit on the upside in 2021, and then once again down into the negatives of revenue for 2022. So now they're just starting to eke up a little bit.May was an increase by 7.5% in revenue. So looking really good there and out, of course, of the negatives in that area. And this is good news for hospitals across the board, whether it's nonprofit or for profit. And it's also going to really impact other sectors as well. And med tech, for example, which is where you get your surgical devices, medical monitoring devices, and the like, all of those are also going to be impacted.Meanwhile, the concern that came from yesterday's news on the insurers seems to have worn off. It was by some analysts measure a bit of an overreaction to the news, considering that the measure being used or being focused on MLR-- medical loss ratio-- wasn't going to be too greatly impacted by this utilization. But it does stand to be seen whether or not next year's prices and premiums will be affected by this increase in utilization. So that's where things stand right now.- Anjalee, thanks so much for breaking that down for us here today. Yahoo Finance's own, Anjalee Khemlani.]"

Demand for procedures like hip and knee surgeries is rising again, which will leave fewer premiums in hand after paying for the procedures for the health insurers. This is likely to boost UNH's medical care ratio in the second quarter.However, companies providing surgery services and medical equipment are expected to gain from the resumption of elective procedures. UnitedHealth’s Optum Health unit is likely to witness higher utilization, especially in ambulatory surgery operations. This can offset the negative impact.UNH’s Optum Health segment, which has been gaining from a greater number of people served under value-based care arrangements and consistent strengthening of care delivery services, will likely continue its promising run.In the first quarter, revenues from the Optum business line totaled $54.1 billion, up from $43.3 billion in the year-ago period. Also, earnings from overall Optum operations increased to $3.7 billion in the first quarter from the year-ago level of $3.2 billion.Hence, even if the increased elective surgeries have the potential to have a short-term impact on UNH’s earnings, the effect is likely to diminish in the long run.

Yahoo Finance healthcare reporter Anjalee Khemlani details the rise in medical costs as more Americans reportedly seek surgery and consultations.Video TranscriptRACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, a number of health insurance stocks took a hit yesterday after UnitedHealthcare said they were seeing an increase in hip and knee replacement surgeries. But today, it's a different story. Medical health insurers are now rallying. Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani has the details for us. Hi, Anj. Why the turnaround here?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Hey. Yeah, well, to start off, let's just take a step back and get a sense of where this came from. It came from a UnitedHealthcare executive at a Goldman Sachs conference saying, quote, that they're starting to see seniors getting more comfortable with accessing services for things like knees and hips and the like, and that really puts pressure on Medicare spend. So that's what really set off that hit in the stocks.If you take a look at what that really means, it's what is known as medical loss ratio for insurers. And that is required by the Affordable Care Act, where insurers are basically supposed to spend a good portion of the premium dollars that they get in. That number is 80% to 85%. That's what they target.So if it's not met, then they end up having to rebate those dollars back to the clients, which typically happens actually more in the individual market rather than large group or even Medicare and the like.So what really ends-- what really we're looking at is the Medicare side of it. And, of course, we know those players are some of the largest in the country, including the likes of United, Cigna, Humana, Centene, and the like. All of those are really where the pressure was building up.Now, what they really have to look at is UnitedHealth's projections. They did say in the last quarter, they were looking at 82% to 83% of that MLR number. And that's still holds. It was just up slightly based on this uptick in surgeries. And that is coming from the pent up demand that we saw because of COVID, of course, that really put a damper on any kind of inpatient or outpatient surgery. And that's what we're starting to see just a little bit of an uptick.Story continuesNow, this can possibly impact these companies moving forward in the upcoming quarter on whether or not they priced correctly their prices and their bids for the spend for 2024. So that's where it becomes kind of an issue that they need to look at on whether or not they accounted correctly for the potential uptick or if this is just sort of a smaller blip that they're just starting to see a little bit right now. So that could affect their revenue moving forward. And that's where some of the confusion came from.Some analysts said it would be an overreaction or not necessarily accurate to look at all the companies broadly as a result of this. You know, but we'll have to just see when their next round of earnings comes up to see exactly what happened with these numbers.RACHELLE AKUFFO: So then, Anj, for consumers who are wondering, look, should I be worried about, you know, my costs going up or how soon I might start seeing this showing up? What should they take away from this?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Well, generally, there actually is, you know, a look at numbers for the upcoming year. There is potential for increased premium. But this, like I mentioned, largely affects the Medicare business. That's where they're looking at potential for the increased rates and increased spend.There are other numbers that just came out yesterday looking at the estimated spend for the larger commercial market. And there might be a slight increase in premiums again because we're now seeing more utilization of the health care system, broadly speaking. People are getting back into the routine of seeing the doctor, scheduling surgeries, and other procedures.And so we can expect that that's going to increase the spend for the companies, for the insurance companies, and therefore, translate into a slight increase in premiums. So that's just what the projections are for now. And, of course, when the rates come in, we'll know more for sure.RACHELLE AKUFFO: All right, well, thank you for getting us up to speed on that. Anjalee Khemlani there for us. Thank you.]"

(NYSE:UNH) is one of the largest health insurance providers in the United States, offering a range of health insurance products and services to individuals, employers and government programs. It provides coverage for medical, dental, vision and pharmacy services, among others. UnitedHealth works with a network of health care providers and facilities to offer a broad range of healt hcare options to its customers.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with UNH. Click here to check it out. UNH 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of UNHPeter Lynch Chart of UNHFrom a business perspective, it is known for its high market share. It serves millions of individuals and organizations across the United States and has a strong network of health care providers and facilities. The company claims it is committed to advancing health care through its insurance offerings, health care services and technology solutions.The shares of UnitedHealth witnessed a major selloff on June 14, closing the day at $459.86, down 6.40%. This steep drop was likely due to the company's warning of rising costs in the second quarter of 2023. This is bad news, but personally, I believe the selloff is overblown. The bigger picture remains positive for the company, as its fundamentals are robust and its wide economic moat supports continued strength in business operations.UnitedHealth Group: Why the Selloff Is OverblownUnitedHealth warned of rising costsThe health insurance provider warned about rising costs because now that the pandemic seems to be under control, seniors are choosing to have elective surgeries that have delayed them, mostly knee and hip procedures. Tim Noel, CEO of UnitedHealths Medicare and retirement business, indicated that now that mask mandates and other Covid-19 restrictions have been lifted, more seniors are comfortable with accessing services for treatments they might have delayed before.Chief financial officer John Rex said the trend towards more elective surgeries could push the companys ratio of costs for claims versus premiums toward the upper range of its full-year outlook in the second quarter.Story continuesThis factor will harm the profitability of UnitedHealth, raising its costs. However, this surge in elective surgeries by seniors will likely only be temporary, just like the pandemic was. After the backlogged surgeries are done, things should return to normal. Additionally, UnitedHealth can pass a large portion of the inflation to its premiums as it has enough of a moat that customers don't really have the choice to refuse, which will mitigate the increased expected costs.Fundamentals remain strongThe fundamentals for UnitedHealth remain very strong. The company has a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.87, which is not excessive, as well as an interest coverage ratio of 11.23 and a Piotroski F-Score of 8 out of 9. The GF Score of 97 out of 100 suggests outperformance potential according to a historical study by GuruFocus.UnitedHealth Group: Why the Selloff Is OverblownThe company has increased its net margin to 6.25% for 2022, the highest level since 2016 and solid among its peer group. This indicates the presence of a potential competitive advantage, a hypothesis which is further supported by the broader economic moat the company has.A strong economic moatUnitedHealth appears to have a strong economic moat, primarily due to the following factors: scale, diverse business segments, integrated health care services, a wide network of health care providers, technological capabilities and financial strength.UnitedHealth is one of the largest health care companies in the United States, serving millions of customers. The company's scale allows it to negotiate favorable contracts with health care providers and pharmaceutical companies, resulting in cost advantages and better pricing for its customers.UnitedHealth operates through two main segments, UnitedHealthcare and Optum, which provide a diverse range of health care services. This diversification helps the company mitigate risks associated with changes in health care regulations and market dynamics. It also allows UnitedHealth to capture value across the entire health care value chain, from insurance to technology solutions.UnitedHealthcare provides health insurance coverage, while Optum delivers a wide range of health care services and technology solutions. This integration enhances the customer experience, improves efficiency and strengthens the company's competitive position.Let's talk a bit more about Optum, the technology and services segment of UnitedHealth. This segment has developed advanced health care analytics, data management and technology solutions. These capabilities allow the company to leverage data-driven insights, enhance health care delivery and drive efficiency. The investment in technology via Optum makes it challenging for competitors to achieve the same level of expertise and infrastructure.UnitedHealth's strong financial position and cash flows mean it can invest more in research and development, strategic acquisitions and other growth initiatives. This means the company has solid chances of being able to keep its industry technology dominance.This surge in elective surgeries is not good news for profitability in the near-term. However, I don't think this situation will last for long, and the negative effects will be only temporary. UnitedHealth looks modestly undervalued now in my opinion, and the recent selloff could thus provide a margin of safety.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

His picks include: EV charging company ChargePoint as Tesla makes more deals with competitors and UnitedHealth after health insurance stocks recently took a hit.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]AKIKO FUJITA: Well, let's take a look at some stocks that may not be moving markets today, but our guest thinks deserves some recognition. Let's bring back in Chris Versace, Tematica research chief investment officer. We were talking about EVs before the break. There's a play in there somewhere that you're liking, right?CHRIS VERSACE: Yes, there is. It's a company called--AKIKO FUJITA: Infrastructures is what we're talking about.CHRIS VERSACE: Well, infrastructure, yes. So there's a couple of different aspects of the infrastructure bill. And with regarding EVs, I actually like ChargePoint, ticker symbol CHPT. It's a play on the pain point, right, as we see EV adoption, right? All these cars moving around, they do need to be charged, right? So that's one that I really do like.And you look at the share price where it's kind of pulled back a little bit. You know, we have a $15 price target on it. And we own it just to be clear in the Action Alerts plus portfolio. We like it as a longer term play. So that's--JULIE HYMAN: Why hasn't it done better? I mean, we had the infrastructure bill passed. In theory--CHRIS VERSACE: It's a great-- no, it's a great question. So the way I think about it is if we were to go back two or three quarters ago, we saw more typical infrastructure companies, Vulcan Materials, United Rentals, which we also own in the portfolio, which we also like quite a bit. They were kind of starting off, and then they kind of languished, right?What we're waiting for is confirmation that, yes, the spending is ramping. And when we look at that type of construction, we get the monthly construction spending data out. And non-residential construction in particular has been strong and strengthening over the last few months. And that's why you've seen like United Rentals go from around 330 a couple of weeks ago to right around 395, $400 as of earlier this week, right? So the market is looking for confirmation.Story continuesI did a podcast conversation with Orion energy. And they do a couple of different things, including building EV charging stations. And they confirm that, yes, the bill has been passed, the funds are weaving their way through, right? And they need to get into hands, products need to be developed, plans need to be laid, that sort of thing. So we should see strength from that side of the infrastructure bill really start to pick up in the second half of the year.AKIKO FUJITA: But were you surprised by the reaction, the stock reaction on the back of this announcement between Tesla and Ford and GM?CHRIS VERSACE: No, I wasn't, because--AKIKO FUJITA: Because ChargePoint still benefits, right, the more adoption there is. It's not like ChargePoint, you know-- Tesla's win comes at the expense of ChargePoint.CHRIS VERSACE: Music to my ears because you're 100% correct on that. So there seems to be-- and I made this point-- if we were talking about regular infrastructure, right, we wouldn't be like, oh, only Caterpillar's going to win, or only this company is going to win. You would say, wow, there is a lot of spending coming. It's going to be a rising tide that lifts a lot of boats. And it's the same thing here.But for some reason, right, whether it's ChargePoint, EVgo, Blink, they have been kind of in this war, if you will, with Tesla shares, because earlier this-- late last year, earlier this year, bad news for Tesla hit the EV charging stocks. And now there's been on some headlines, understandably so, that Tesla is making these partnerships. So the thought process there was like, oh, this can't be good for anybody else. And then we find out, no, no, this is just a connector, and, oh, guess what, Tesla with Ford and GM, they're influencing what's likely to be the standard. And everybody else comes out and says, we'll have those connectors too. We're back to a rising tide.JULIE HYMAN: Well, I mean, if you think of it as the-- it's like gasoline-- gas stations, right?CHRIS VERSACE: 100%.JULIE HYMAN: Like it's not like people by Shell over Exxon because they have more gas stations.AKIKO FUJITA: And by the way, Tesla drivers already go to ChargePoint. You just add an adapter.CHRIS VERSACE: That's correct. Yeah, you're both making excellent points, and it confirms what I'm saying. So I love it.JULIE HYMAN: There's one other stock that you like that I want to pinpoint because it had a really bad day yesterday. I'm talking about UnitedHealth. After the company came out and issued a warning, said loss is going to be climbing because people are doing more now elective surgeries coming back, so their costs are going to be going higher. It was a really interesting day because UnitedHealth doesn't tend to move that much, usually. But it plunged, other health insurers plunged. So why are you looking at them?CHRIS VERSACE: So we're not actually looking at UnitedHealth.JULIE HYMAN: Oh, OK.CHRIS VERSACE: So in the portfolio, we have a company called Elevance Health, OK? So similar, and did it get hit yesterday? Of course, it did. A whole kit and caboodle and including CVS got hit. So I think it was kind of a knee jerk reaction. From my perspective, we've been liking picking up shares of Elevance Health between 440, 450, something like that. And this kind of knocks it down below that level.The funny thing is the day before Elevance getting ready to make the investor conference rounds, came out and reiterated its guidance, which says, hey, we're going to grow our earnings 12 and a half percent in 2023. So I think when you compare or contrast that, if Elevance was seeing what United was seeing, they wouldn't have said that. So I think that's an opportunity for ELV shares.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of Soros' history, investment philosophy, and hedge fund performance, go directly to George Soros' Top 5 Stock Picks.George Soros, 92, maintains a net worth of approximately $8.5 billion, ranking as the 236th wealthiest individual worldwide, according to Bloomberg. Soros, a well-known financier and philanthropist, has gained recognition for his distinctive investment strategies and global impact. In 2011, Soros transformed his Soros Fund Management into a family office, closing it to external investors. With approximately $28 billion in assets under management, the family office oversees Soros' personal wealth and the substantial endowments dedicated to his philanthropic initiatives.George Soros' top 10 stock picksGeorge Soros of Soros Fund ManagementSoros applied scientific and free market principles to his investment strategies, starting with his work at F.M. Mayer and establishing the Quantum Fund. Over time, he grew his initial investment of $12 million into a remarkable $20 billion by the early 2000s. His investment philosophy includes principles such as reflexivity theory, gradually increasing investment positions based on market trends, paying attention to physical cues, blending political acumen, and seeking diverse perspectives before making significant decisions.In the first quarter of 2023, George Soros’ Soros Fund Management portfolio value decreased from $7.26 billion to $6.49 billion. In addition, the hedge fund made new purchases of 66 stocks, added to holdings of 31 stocks, sold out 89 stocks, and reduced holdings in 54 stocks. The finance sector accounted for most of Soros Fund Management's portfolio, comprising 35.81% of the total holdings. The top three stocks represent about 28.30% of the portfolio. Some of the notable stocks held by the hedge fund in Q1 2023 included Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX).Story continuesOur MethodologyBy examining Soros Fund Management's 13F filings for the first quarter of 2023, we identified George Soros' top 10 holdings.10. The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL)Soros Fund Management’s Holdings: $39,211,047 Percentage of Soros Fund Management’s Portfolio: 0.6%The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) operates globally, engaging in the manufacturing, marketing, and sales of skincare, makeup, fragrance, and hair care products. George Soros stock portfolio held 159,097 shares of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) in the first quarter of 2023, worth $39.21 million and representing 0.6% of the total 13F securities.On May 4, RBC Capital analyst Nik Modi reduced the price target on The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) to $265 from $290 while maintaining an ‘Outperform’ rating on the shares.In its Q4 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge All Cap Growth Strategy provided the following insight regarding The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL):“The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), which manufactures and markets cosmetics, fragrances, skin and hair care products across a number of well-known global brands including Clinique, MAC and Bobbi Brown, adds to our group of secular growers. Estee Lauder is a global leader in the prestige beauty space, which has outgrown the broader home and personal care category since 2010 and has historically been recession resilient. The company has substantial brand and pricing power and is overindexed to the highly profitable prestige skin care category. We believe the company’s most recent earnings report and 2023 guidance update, which was cut significantly due to uncertainty over China’s zero-COVID policy (China and travel retail are key growth drivers), provided an attractive entry point. At this point, we believe the stock has been significantly derisked and could see potential upside from a China recovery.”9. Aramark (NYSE:ARMK)Soros Fund Management’s Holdings: $43,845,155 Percentage of Soros Fund Management’s Portfolio: 0.67%Aramark (NYSE:ARMK) serves a wide range of clients, including those in education, healthcare, business and industry, sports, leisure, and corrections, offering food, facilities, and uniform services both within the United States and internationally.

(NYSE:AWK) and its subsidiaries provide water and wastewater services to 1,600 communities across 14 states in the United States, serving around 3.4 million active customers. Julien Dumoulin-Smith, an analyst at BofA, increased the firm's price target on American Water Works Company, Inc. (NYSE:AWK) from $134 to $140 on April 24. However, Dumoulin-Smith maintained an ‘Underperform’ rating on the company's shares.Securities filings for the first quarter of 2023 reveal that George Soros' fund added American Water Works Company, Inc. (NYSE:AWK) to its portfolio by purchasing 316,400 shares worth $46.35 million, representing 0.71% of the total securities.ClearBridge Investments made the following comment about American Water Works Company, Inc. (NYSE:AWK) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Turning to the U.S. and Canada, U.S. electric utility PG&amp;E and U.S. water company American Water Works Company, Inc. (NYSE:AWK) also made strong contributions. AWK provides water and wastewater utility services to customers across several states within the U.S. Shares did well after AWK announced the acquisition of a municipal facility, providing additional opportunities for growth.”7.

(NASDAQ:RIVN)Soros Fund Management’s Holdings: $55,404,422 Percentage of Soros Fund Management’s Portfolio: 0.85%Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) designs, manufactures, and sells electric vehicles. On May 10, DA Davidson analyst Michael Shlisky lowered the price target on Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) to $11 from $16 and maintained an ‘Underperform’ rating. Q1 revenue and EBITDA exceeded expectations, but Rivian faces challenge in reducing costs and maintaining supplier relationships, according to the analyst's note.Even after selling more than 10.76 million shares of Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) stock in the first quarter, Soros Fund Management is the company's leading shareholder.

(NASDAQ:NFLX).In its Q1 2023 investor letter, Baron Funds shared the following observation regarding Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN):“Shares of Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN), a U.S.-based EV manufacturer, fell during the quarter. Despite seven-fold growth in its monthly production rate between late 2021 and the end of 2022, production guidance for 2023 missed analyst forecasts because of supply-chain constraints, principally semiconductors. Moreover, notwithstanding an attractive long-term opportunity and favorable product reviews by customers and industry experts, investors remain concerned about liquidity risks as the company burns cash during its early production stage while unit economics remain challenged. Vehicle sales through the end of 2023 will be at Rivian’s legacy vehicle pricing, which was set before inflationary and supply-chain pressures emerged last year across the entire automotive space. New pricing and improved unit economics should be realized in 2024, and Rivian is slated to launch its R2 vehicle line in 2026. We have adjusted Rivian to a smaller position in our portfolio. Despite near-term macro and execution risks, we do believe that Rivian’s current valuation offers attractive long-term returns. During the year, we will remain focused on Rivian’s production ramp, vehicle demand, unit-level economics, and cost controls as well as progress on its R2 vehicle platform, its next-gen Enduro electric motor, and its battery system advancements.” Click to continue reading and see George Soros' Top 5 Stock Picks. Suggested articles:10 Best Stocks To Buy For A Stock Market Game13 Best Communication Services Stocks To Invest InWarren Buffett’s $5.7 Billion Dividend Portfolio: Top 15 PicksDisclosure: None. George Soros' Top 10 Stock Picks is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Additionally, each of these stocks have high Zacks Ranks, suggesting strong near-term expectations for their stocks.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMcDonald’sMcDonald’s is a leading fast-food chain that currently operates more than 39,000 restaurants in more than 100 countries. The company mainly operates and franchises quick-service restaurants (QSRs) under the McDonald’s brand.Nearly 93% of the company’s restaurants worldwide are owned and operated by independent local businesspeople. MCD’s revenues include sales by company-operated restaurants but primarily come in the form of franchise fees from the independently managed restaurants.Earnings have grown at a very stable and impressive rate from just $1.40 per share in 1999 to $10.45 per share today. That’s a CAGR of 8%. Because of its business model, MCD essentially charges rent to its restaurant owners and collects a franchise fee. This has been a very successful and enduring strategy.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMcDonald's currently boasts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Current quarter earnings have been revised higher by 4% and are expected to grow 8% YoY. FY23 earnings have been upgraded by 5% and are projected to grow 9.3% YoY.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAdobeAdobe is one of the largest software companies in the world collecting licensing fees from customers, which form the bulk of its revenue. ADBE also offers technical support and education, which accounts for the balance.Story continuesNot only have ADBE earnings grown steadily, but they have accelerated considerably in the last decade, forming the always desirable hockey stick chart. Adobe’s EPS have compounded at a ridiculous 14.4% annually over the last 25 years and its stock has appreciated over 9,000% over that period.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAdobe currently enjoys a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) reflecting upward trending earnings revisions. EPS is expected to grow 13.3% annually over the 3-5 years, in line with its long-term average, which is remarkable considering how large a company it is today.ADBE is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 39x, which is just above the industry average of 33x, and a bit above its 25-year median of 34x.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPepsiCoPepsiCo is one of the leading global food and beverage companies. Its complementary brands include Frito-Lay snacks, Pepsi-Cola beverages, Gatorade sports drinks, Tropicana juices and Quaker foods. The company serves customers in more than 200 countries and territories.Earnings growth in PEP is about the smoothest up trending line in finance that I have seen. Over the last 25 years annual EPS have grown from $1.21 per share to $7.00 per share, which is a CAGR of 7.3%.Additionally, over the last 20 years, PEP has reduced its share count by 20% through persistent share buyback programs. This has further ensured upward movement in the stock.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMaking PepsiCo an even more compelling investment is its generous dividend, which yields 2.8%. Pepsi has increased its dividend every single year for the last 50 years, making it one of the very prestigious dividend king stocks. Over the last five years the dividend has been increased by 5.4% annually.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchProcter and GambleProcter &amp; Gamble is a multinational consumer goods behemoth that has established itself as a global leader in its industry. With a rich history spanning over 180 years, PG has built a reputation for delivering high-quality products and brands that are household names worldwide. The company operates across multiple categories, including beauty, grooming, healthcare, fabric and home care, and baby care, with a diverse portfolio of well-known brands such as Gillette, Pampers, Crest, and Tide, among others.With a consistently growing portfolio of household products, as well as top-notch execution over decades, PG has built an impressive record of growing earnings.Procter and Gamble currently earns a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Current quarter earnings are projected to grow 9% YoY, while sales are projected to grow 2.3% over the same period. FY23 earnings are expected to increase just 1% YoY, however FY24 is expected to resume growth, with estimates of an 8.3% YoY increase.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIf consistently growing earnings wasn’t enough to guarantee stock appreciation PG also has the strong tendency to return huge amounts of cash to shareholders. Though stock buybacks management has decreased share count by 17% over the last 15 years.Furthermore, the company offers a dividend yield of 2.6%, which it has increased by an average of 6.3% annually over the last five years. Procter and Gamble has paid a dividend for 132 years and has increased the dividend payment consecutively for 66 years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineInvesting in stocks with a long-term trend of growing earnings per share can be a prudent strategy for investors seeking sustainable growth in their portfolios.

311,a2bd77e1-7426-3711-acba-0f060d3122c1,PG,2023-06-16,Colgate (CL) Looks Solid on Pricing Action & Expansion Strategy,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/colgate-cl-looks-solid-pricing-130500659.html,1686834300,STORY,"['CL', 'COTY', 'PG', 'CLX']","[Colgate-Palmolive Company CL is well-poised for the long term on innovation, brand strength and digital capabilities. The company continues to gain from its stringent pricing actions and accelerated revenue growth management plans. Revenue growth management initiatives led to double-digit pricing gains worldwide in the first quarter of 2023. This led to impressive organic sales growth in the quarter.On an organic basis, Colgate’s sales advanced 10% in the first quarter, with improvements in all divisions and categories. This marked the 17th successive quarter of organic sales growth at or above its long-term target of 3-5% growth. While volumes remained soft, pricing gains of 12% aided organic sales. Bold pricing actions and accelerated revenue growth management plans were key drivers.Colgate remains on track with its efforts to improve product availability through enhanced distribution to newer markets and channels. However, the company is not immune to higher raw material and logistics costs worldwide and unfavorable currency issues.Shares of Colgate have risen 3.4% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 1.9% and the Consumer Staples sector’s rise of 1.6%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s current financial-year sales and earnings suggests growth of 6.4% and 5.7% from the year-ago reported numbers.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat’s Working Well for CL?Expanding the availability of products through enhanced distribution to newer markets and channels is one of Colgate’s priorities to improve organic sales. The company is aggressively expanding into faster growth channels while extending the geographic footprint of its brands.In 2019, Colgate expanded its portfolio by introducing pharmacy brands like elmex and meridol to newer markets. It remains impressed with the performance of professional skincare businesses — Elta MD and PCA Skin — in spas and dermatologists.The company expanded its premium skincare portfolio with the buyout of the Filorga skincare business. Colgate is witnessing strong market share gains in North America and China, its two largest markets, with increased share gains across all other regions.Innovation and in-store implementation have been the guiding principles for Colgate’s growth strategy over the years. CL’s innovation strategy is focused on growing in adjacent categories and product segments. It is also focused on the premiumization of its Oral Care portfolio through major innovations. Backed by premium innovation, products, including CO. by Colgate, Colgate Elixir toothpaste and Colgate enzyme whitening toothpaste, have been performing well.Its innovation efforts are highlighted by the continued expansion of the Naturals and Therapeutics divisions and the Hello Products LLC buyout. The company also partnered with Philips to introduce electric toothbrushes in Latin America, where the use of electric toothbrushes is low. This long-term deal will bring together the world’s number one oral care brand and the number one manufacturer of sonic toothbrushes under a co-brand, namely Philips Colgate. This product line will come with a variety of electric toothbrushes at different prices.Colgate’s Hill's business has been a major contributor to sales growth for the past few quarters. The segment reported sales growth of 21.5% in the first quarter, with organic sales growth of 14%. Results gained from an 11.5% increase in pricing, volume growth of 12% on a reported basis and 2.5% on an organic volume basis, partly offset by a 2% adverse currency impact. Organic sales were aided by gains in the United States and Europe.Strength in oral care and pet nutrition remains a key growth driver. The company’s newly launched Prescription Diet Derm Complete has been gaining market share and is likely to be rolled out internationally in the coming quarters. Colgate also remains focused on expanding the availability of its products through the e-commerce channel as more consumers are using online services for their essential needs.Management raised its sales and profit forecast for 2023. Colgate-Palmolive anticipates net sales growth of 3-6%. The current projection indicates gains from the acquisitions of pet food businesses, offset by a low-single-digit adverse currency impact.The company anticipates full-year organic sales growth between 4% and 6%. CL foresees adjusted gross profit margin expansion and increased advertising investments. Management guided mid-single-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share.Story continuesHurdles to OvercomeDespite sales growth, the company has been witnessing continued pressure from raw and packaging material costs, which dented the gross margin performance in the first quarter of 2023. This includes an adverse impact of 90 bps from private-label sales resulting from the previously disclosed acquisitions of pet food businesses.Colgate’s gross profit margin contracted 160 basis points bps to 56.9% on a GAAP and adjusted basis. Additionally, the adverse foreign currency impact is likely to affect the company’s profitability in the near term.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the broader Consumer Staples space are Coty Inc. COTY, Procter &amp; Gamble PG and Clorox CLX.Coty currently sports a Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) and has an expected long-term earnings growth rate of 15.6%.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned -5.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +6.2% change. The Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry, to which P&amp;G belongs, has lost 6.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, P&amp;G is expected to post earnings of $1.32 per share, indicating a change of +9.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.86 points to a change of +0.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.35 indicates a change of +8.3% from what P&amp;G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for P&amp;G.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For P&amp;G, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $19.95 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +2.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $81.41 billion and $85.1 billion estimates indicate +1.5% and +4.5% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryP&amp;G reported revenues of $20.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.5%. EPS of $1.37 for the same period compares with $1.33 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $19.3 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.01%. The EPS surprise was +3.79%.Over the last four quarters, P&amp;G surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.P&amp;G is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&amp;G. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(LEN) is betting big on meeting the ""dominant need"" in housing by being a production-first builder.""At the local levels, the need for workforce housing is a dominant need and it's become a social imperative,"" Stuart Miller, chairman of the board at Lennar, said on the earnings call with analysts Thursday. ""There's a void that needs to be filled... And what we're going to do is instead of driving price, we are going to drive pace and hold price.""The builder's core strategy of selling after completion to keep excess inventory in check follows its second quarter earnings on Wednesday that blew past Wall Street's expectations.Adjusted earnings per share came in at $2.94, beating the $2.31 estimate from analysts, according to Bloomberg. Revenue in the quarter totaled $8.0 billion, up from the $7.29 billion expected by analysts.Lennar said new home orders rose 0.5% year over year to 17,885, above the 16,501 purchase contracts the company was forecast to sign. For the quarter, most of the new orders came from the East and West regions.Lennar also put its hammers to work as it ground through its backlog of homes for sale, which dropped 29% for the year to 20,214, slightly lower than analysts' estimates of 20,437. Additionally, cancellations sank by 13.5%, allowing new home deliveries to increase by 3% for the quarter.A worker makes repairs to a home under construction at the Lennar Bridgeway home development on December 15, 2021, in Newark, California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) (Justin Sullivan via Getty Images)Starts in focusLennar didn’t slow down its speed of construction of new homes. In fact, the homebuilder pushed the gas pedal on the excavator this quarter.""We really accelerated our starts in Q2, recognizing the market opportunity where the industry was pulling back,"" Jonathan Jaffe, Lennar's co-CEO, said on the earnings call.""And given that we didn't have an inventory buildup because of our strategy, we felt there was an opportunity to be more aggressive with starts and take advantage of the lack of resale inventory as well as the lack of new-sale inventory,"" Jaffe added.Story continuesExisting home sales contracted in April because there were fewer deals to be had, pushing more homebuyers to the newly built market and sending sales upward.Mortgage rates also aren't helping buyers, offering a key opportunity for builders. The rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage dipped to 6.69% from 6.71% the previous week, Freddie Mac reported Thursday. Rates this year have seesawed between 6% and 7%.""The strong demand for housing that had been curtailed by sticker shock and affordability challenges has returned,"" Miller said, ""while the housing market adjusted prices, incentives, including rate buydowns and production costs in order to enable customers to afford needed shelter.""But even those incentives aren't needed as much. The percentage of incentives was 8.4% in the quarter, down from 10.2% in the first quarter.Rising rates also continue to keep inventory tight, discouraging homeowners from listing their homes for sale and making the new home market more attractive.""We feel comfortable that we'll be able to sell at an accelerated pace because we'll have the inventory,"" Jaffe said. And by ""providing that inventory with a backdrop of really healthy demand for housing. So that gives us confidence that we'll be able to continue to accelerate our sales pace, managing that start pace.""Outlook looks goodLennar raised its full-year guidance to deliver between 68,000 and 70,000 homes, up from its previous forecast of 62,000 and 66,000 units, “signaling a new level of confidence in the new home market despite current mortgage rates re-approaching the 7% threshold,” Buck Horne, analyst at Raymond James &amp; Associates, wrote in a note to clients following the earnings release.For the third quarter, the homebuilder expects to deliver between 17,750 and 18,250 homes. Although the average sales price on homes is down 10% from last year, Lennar expects pricing to remain constant throughout the year.""We have seen in our numbers that net average sales prices on home closings have dropped approximately 10% or 11% on home sales from the peak of approximately $500,000 in 2022 to approximately $450,000 now, and we expect that pricing is going to remain constant throughout the year,"" Miller said.Signs are posted in front of homes at the Lennar Bridgeway home development on December 15, 2021, in Newark, California.(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) (Justin Sullivan via Getty Images)The company also adjusted its gross margin outlook to between 23.5% and 24.0%. Meanwhile, executives on the call gave some insight for the next quarter by saying sales activity and cancellation rates in the first weeks of June have been consistent with the second-quarter results.Still, some analysts on Wall Street remain on the fence about Lennar’s output compared to its peers like D.R. Horton (DHI), one Deutsche Bank analyst pointed out.""The reality is that the cumulative profits generated by DHI are comparable to those from LEN, but DHI is far better positioned to continue to grow volumes and profits from here and that is the opportunity cost of exercising moderation in the face of strong demand,"" Joe Ahlersmeyer, an equity research analyst at Deutsche Bank, wrote in a note to clients before the earnings release.Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

""It was a family event,"" says Malone, a Leadership Development Program (LDP) associate with Principal®. ""We rented a truck, and my mom, dad, and little brother all came.""Malone kept a brave face-but she was anxious. She knew no one and was the first in her family to attend college. ""When they left, I realized I'm an adult. I didn't know when they would be back to see me,"" she says.No matter: Malone dug in, putting her talents to good use and navigating the challenge with the same traits she's used all her life: endless curiosity and boundless energy.Focused on function and enthusiastic about growthMalone remembers when her dad gave her a build-your-own-computer kit; she was about 7 or 8 and it was her first inkling that engineering might be in her future. ""He and I would work together,"" she says. ""It started that journey into STEM for me.""So, too, did her foray into her school's robotics team; they won competitions in just their first year. ""When I built something and it worked-when it clicked-that was the most exciting feeling ever,"" she says.Computer engineering, with its mix of electrical know-how and software programming, checked all the boxes, and Iowa State offered a highly ranked program.1 But the transition after her family dropped her off-""campus was so beautiful and I felt good about my choice""-was, in her words, ""a lot."" Take the first-year intro chemistry class with 300 students. ""My graduating class was 24, and it was challenging to learn how to navigate that, how to talk to a professor, how to study, who to study with,"" she says.Story continuesEntering engineering as a woman and a woman of color was also hard. ""I didn't see many females that looked like me and didn't really find my support group and peers until I was a senior,"" Malone says.By then, she was set to graduate with a double degree in computer engineering and management information systems. ""I thought I wanted to be a software developer,"" Malone says. ""But then my junior year I took business classes and realized there was often miscommunication between tech and business, even though those areas service each other. What if I could be someone who could serve as a liaison between the two so they can function and grow?""Marketing is fun - and so is leadership.Malone had internships from her freshman year on; in 2019 she landed one at Principal, where a leader encouraged Malone to meet other teams and see how that connection between tech and business worked in practice. After graduation, she entered the Principal LDP, a three-year commitment with six- to nine-month rotations around the business.""I've gotten to work in spaces I would have never thought to get into,"" Malone says. The most fun and most surprising? Marketing. ""I have no background in it, but tech is so wrapped around marketing. It opened my eyes.""Malone flexed her leadership muscles-and found a new spark-during a rotation in Mexico where she was an agile scrum leader for a team of 12. ""We had teams that had some disconnect and had to get them to work together to overcome their stuck points. To not only understand the tech but to be a people leader, I really enjoyed that,"" she says. ""I realized my career at Principal isn't going to be limited to one area. It's going to be thoughtful. There are areas and leaders willing to work with me to help figure out what I want. I'm tech driven but people passionate.""How do you affect change?Malone opted to stay in the Des Moines area immediately post-graduation, surrounded by a core group of friends from college. Last year, however, she moved back to Indianapolis; her dad had died, and her family was still in the city. ""When I left for school, part of me felt like I was abandoning them when they were struggling-I'm one of the pillars of my family,"" Malone says.And she feels obligated to try to affect change in her hometown. ""I come from a community with a lot of challenges; it's impoverished, it's a food desert, and schools need help. But it's shaped who I am, and I want the best for the people here,"" she says. ""How can I better my community? I have an education and work for a company that offers a number of resources, so how do I take what I've learned and bring it back to them?""She's not sure what shape those efforts will take, and no matter what, she wants to move back to Des Moines in a few years-this time, with her mom. It's rare to know what career might be a good fit when you're in elementary school, but Malone-who just finished an MBA with a focus in information systems and leadership to boot-really did. ""To finally figure things out-I love that feeling,"" Malone says. ""To be able to create something that works is exciting.""1Iowa State UniversityInsurance products and plan administrative services provided through Principal Life Insurance Company®, a member of the Principal Financial Group®, Des Moines, IA 50392.© 2023 Principal Financial Services, Inc.​​​Principal®, Principal Financial Group®, and Principal and the logomark design are registered trademarks of Principal Financial Services, Inc., a Principal Financial Group company, in the United States and are trademarks and service marks of Principal Financial Services, Inc., in various countries around the world.2921921-062023View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Principal Financial Group on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Principal Financial GroupWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/principal-financial-groupEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Principal Financial GroupView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/761572/Katlyn-Malone-Tech-Driven-People-Passionate]"

(XOM)Tracey has discussed how her grandmother, and her grandmother’s sister, both inherited shares of ExxonMobil from their father in 1972. They both owned shares for decades.Shares of ExxonMobil, however, have not had the returns of Berkshire Hathaway over the decades. From Jan 3, 2005 to June 13, 2023, or 18 years and 4 months, ExxonMobil was up just 112.5%, without dividends reinvested. You basically doubled your money in a little over 18 years. That underperformed both the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq 100.But ExxonMobil is a cyclical and in 2023, it is again cheap, with a forward P/E of 11. It is also a dividend aristocrat, as it has raised its dividend for 41 consecutive years. It is currently yielding 3.46%.Story continuesIs it time to consider ExxonMobil for the portfolio again?2.       Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)We are all familiar with the Microsoft millionaires from the 1980s and 90s due to the dot-com boom.But what if you bought on Jan 3, 2005, after the dot-com bust, and held through June 13, 2023? 100 shares purchased on Jan 3, 2005 would have cost you $2674. By 2023, it would have been up 1,150% to $33,429. This is without dividends reinvested.Microsoft is now hitting new all-time highs after gaining 45% year-to-date. It’s not a cheap stock on a P/E basis, trading at 35x.Can this rally in Microsoft continue in 2023?3.       The Sherwin-Williams Company (SHW)Don’t rule out the old economy companies when thinking about compounding.If you had bought shares of Sherwin-Williams on Jan 3, 2005 and held until June 13, 2023, or 18 years and 4 months, your money, with dividends reinvested, would have compounded annually at 18.2%, or 2083%. This easily outperformed the S&amp;P 500 which was up just 263.5%, or 7.25% annually.Shares of Sherwin-Williams is up just 5.1% year-to-date however. It’s not cheap with a forward P/E of 28.Is it too late for buy and hold investors to buy Sherwin-Williams?4.       Fastenal (FAST)Fastenal is another old economy company that long-term investors may overlook.

A Look At Its Intrinsic Value,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sherwin-williams-company-nyse-shw-130014576.html,1686834014,STORY,['SHW'],"[Key InsightsThe projected fair value for Sherwin-Williams is US$199 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityCurrent share price of US$246 suggests Sherwin-Williams is potentially 24% overvaluedOur fair value estimate is 23% lower than Sherwin-Williams' analyst price target of US$257How far off is The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams The ModelWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.28bUS$2.47bUS$2.78bUS$2.95bUS$3.20bUS$3.39bUS$3.56bUS$3.70bUS$3.83bUS$3.94bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x12Analyst x13Analyst x9Analyst x3Analyst x2Est @ 5.99%Est @ 4.83%Est @ 4.01%Est @ 3.44%Est @ 3.04% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.1% US$2.1kUS$2.1kUS$2.2kUS$2.2kUS$2.2kUS$2.1kUS$2.1kUS$2.0kUS$1.9kUS$1.8k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$21bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.9b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.1%– 2.1%) = US$67bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$67b÷ ( 1 + 8.1%)10= US$31bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$51b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$246, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Sherwin-Williams as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.013. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Sherwin-WilliamsStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Chemicals market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a premium to intrinsic value? For Sherwin-Williams, there are three essential factors you should assess:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

On the flipside, UnitedHealth fell 6.4% yesterday while Humana declined 11.2%.Universal Health operates acute care facilities, and outpatient as well as behavioral health care units.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of Soros' history, investment philosophy, and hedge fund performance, go directly to George Soros' Top 5 Stock Picks.George Soros, 92, maintains a net worth of approximately $8.5 billion, ranking as the 236th wealthiest individual worldwide, according to Bloomberg. Soros, a well-known financier and philanthropist, has gained recognition for his distinctive investment strategies and global impact. In 2011, Soros transformed his Soros Fund Management into a family office, closing it to external investors. With approximately $28 billion in assets under management, the family office oversees Soros' personal wealth and the substantial endowments dedicated to his philanthropic initiatives.George Soros' top 10 stock picksGeorge Soros of Soros Fund ManagementSoros applied scientific and free market principles to his investment strategies, starting with his work at F.M. Mayer and establishing the Quantum Fund. Over time, he grew his initial investment of $12 million into a remarkable $20 billion by the early 2000s. His investment philosophy includes principles such as reflexivity theory, gradually increasing investment positions based on market trends, paying attention to physical cues, blending political acumen, and seeking diverse perspectives before making significant decisions.In the first quarter of 2023, George Soros’ Soros Fund Management portfolio value decreased from $7.26 billion to $6.49 billion. In addition, the hedge fund made new purchases of 66 stocks, added to holdings of 31 stocks, sold out 89 stocks, and reduced holdings in 54 stocks. The finance sector accounted for most of Soros Fund Management's portfolio, comprising 35.81% of the total holdings. The top three stocks represent about 28.30% of the portfolio. Some of the notable stocks held by the hedge fund in Q1 2023 included Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX).Story continuesOur MethodologyBy examining Soros Fund Management's 13F filings for the first quarter of 2023, we identified George Soros' top 10 holdings.10. The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL)Soros Fund Management’s Holdings: $39,211,047 Percentage of Soros Fund Management’s Portfolio: 0.6%The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) operates globally, engaging in the manufacturing, marketing, and sales of skincare, makeup, fragrance, and hair care products. George Soros stock portfolio held 159,097 shares of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) in the first quarter of 2023, worth $39.21 million and representing 0.6% of the total 13F securities.On May 4, RBC Capital analyst Nik Modi reduced the price target on The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) to $265 from $290 while maintaining an ‘Outperform’ rating on the shares.In its Q4 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge All Cap Growth Strategy provided the following insight regarding The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL):“The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), which manufactures and markets cosmetics, fragrances, skin and hair care products across a number of well-known global brands including Clinique, MAC and Bobbi Brown, adds to our group of secular growers. Estee Lauder is a global leader in the prestige beauty space, which has outgrown the broader home and personal care category since 2010 and has historically been recession resilient. The company has substantial brand and pricing power and is overindexed to the highly profitable prestige skin care category. We believe the company’s most recent earnings report and 2023 guidance update, which was cut significantly due to uncertainty over China’s zero-COVID policy (China and travel retail are key growth drivers), provided an attractive entry point. At this point, we believe the stock has been significantly derisked and could see potential upside from a China recovery.”9. Aramark (NYSE:ARMK)Soros Fund Management’s Holdings: $43,845,155 Percentage of Soros Fund Management’s Portfolio: 0.67%Aramark (NYSE:ARMK) serves a wide range of clients, including those in education, healthcare, business and industry, sports, leisure, and corrections, offering food, facilities, and uniform services both within the United States and internationally. On April 19, Bernstein initiated coverage of Aramark (NYSE:ARMK), assigning it a ‘Market Perform’ rating and a price target of $38.According to the 13F filings for the first quarter of 2023, the George Soros stock portfolio had 1.22 million shares of Aramark (NYSE:ARMK), worth $43.85 million and representing 0.67% of the total holdings.8. American Water Works Company, Inc. (NYSE:AWK)Soros Fund Management’s Holdings: $46,349,436 Percentage of Soros Fund Management’s Portfolio: 0.71%American Water Works Company, Inc. (NYSE:AWK) and its subsidiaries provide water and wastewater services to 1,600 communities across 14 states in the United States, serving around 3.4 million active customers. Julien Dumoulin-Smith, an analyst at BofA, increased the firm's price target on American Water Works Company, Inc. (NYSE:AWK) from $134 to $140 on April 24. However, Dumoulin-Smith maintained an ‘Underperform’ rating on the company's shares.Securities filings for the first quarter of 2023 reveal that George Soros' fund added American Water Works Company, Inc. (NYSE:AWK) to its portfolio by purchasing 316,400 shares worth $46.35 million, representing 0.71% of the total securities.ClearBridge Investments made the following comment about American Water Works Company, Inc. (NYSE:AWK) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Turning to the U.S. and Canada, U.S. electric utility PG&amp;E and U.S. water company American Water Works Company, Inc. (NYSE:AWK) also made strong contributions. AWK provides water and wastewater utility services to customers across several states within the U.S. Shares did well after AWK announced the acquisition of a municipal facility, providing additional opportunities for growth.”7.

(NYSE:BOWL) by 64%, holding 3 million shares worth approximately $50.85 million, representing 0.78% of the total 13F securities.6. Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN)Soros Fund Management’s Holdings: $55,404,422 Percentage of Soros Fund Management’s Portfolio: 0.85%Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) designs, manufactures, and sells electric vehicles. On May 10, DA Davidson analyst Michael Shlisky lowered the price target on Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) to $11 from $16 and maintained an ‘Underperform’ rating. Q1 revenue and EBITDA exceeded expectations, but Rivian faces challenge in reducing costs and maintaining supplier relationships, according to the analyst's note.Even after selling more than 10.76 million shares of Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) stock in the first quarter, Soros Fund Management is the company's leading shareholder. George Soros' Soros Fund Management still holds more than 3.58 million shares of Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN), worth about $55.40 million.Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) is among the notable stocks in George Soros' portfolio, along with Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX).In its Q1 2023 investor letter, Baron Funds shared the following observation regarding Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN):“Shares of Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN), a U.S.-based EV manufacturer, fell during the quarter. Despite seven-fold growth in its monthly production rate between late 2021 and the end of 2022, production guidance for 2023 missed analyst forecasts because of supply-chain constraints, principally semiconductors. Moreover, notwithstanding an attractive long-term opportunity and favorable product reviews by customers and industry experts, investors remain concerned about liquidity risks as the company burns cash during its early production stage while unit economics remain challenged. Vehicle sales through the end of 2023 will be at Rivian’s legacy vehicle pricing, which was set before inflationary and supply-chain pressures emerged last year across the entire automotive space. New pricing and improved unit economics should be realized in 2024, and Rivian is slated to launch its R2 vehicle line in 2026. We have adjusted Rivian to a smaller position in our portfolio. Despite near-term macro and execution risks, we do believe that Rivian’s current valuation offers attractive long-term returns. During the year, we will remain focused on Rivian’s production ramp, vehicle demand, unit-level economics, and cost controls as well as progress on its R2 vehicle platform, its next-gen Enduro electric motor, and its battery system advancements.” Click to continue reading and see George Soros' Top 5 Stock Picks. Suggested articles:10 Best Stocks To Buy For A Stock Market Game13 Best Communication Services Stocks To Invest InWarren Buffett’s $5.7 Billion Dividend Portfolio: Top 15 PicksDisclosure: None. George Soros' Top 10 Stock Picks is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. With that in mind, the ROCE of Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) looks decent, right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Freeport-McMoRan, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.13 = US$5.8b ÷ (US$51b - US$5.3b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Thus, Freeport-McMoRan has an ROCE of 13%.  In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Metals and Mining industry average of 12%. View our latest analysis for Freeport-McMoRan roceIn the above chart we have measured Freeport-McMoRan's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Freeport-McMoRan here  for free.The Trend Of ROCEWhile the current returns on capital are decent, they haven't changed much. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 13% and the business has deployed 41% more capital into its operations. Since 13% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.Story continuesIn Conclusion...In the end, Freeport-McMoRan has proven its ability to adequately reinvest capital at good rates of return. And long term investors would be thrilled with the 160% return they've received over the last five years. So even though the stock might be more ""expensive"" than it was before, we think the strong fundamentals warrant this stock for further research.On a separate note, we've found   1 warning sign for Freeport-McMoRan   you'll probably want to know about.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

This has lagged the Consumer Staples sector's loss of 3.32% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 6.22% in that time.PepsiCo will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be July 13, 2023. On that day, PepsiCo is projected to report earnings of $1.95 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 4.84%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $21.63 billion, up 6.97% from the year-ago period.PEP's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $7.30 per share and revenue of $90.66 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +7.51% and +4.94%, respectively.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for PepsiCo. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves.

That’s a CAGR of 8%. Because of its business model, MCD essentially charges rent to its restaurant owners and collects a franchise fee. This has been a very successful and enduring strategy.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMcDonald's currently boasts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Current quarter earnings have been revised higher by 4% and are expected to grow 8% YoY.

Its complementary brands include Frito-Lay snacks, Pepsi-Cola beverages, Gatorade sports drinks, Tropicana juices and Quaker foods. The company serves customers in more than 200 countries and territories.Earnings growth in PEP is about the smoothest up trending line in finance that I have seen. Over the last 25 years annual EPS have grown from $1.21 per share to $7.00 per share, which is a CAGR of 7.3%.Additionally, over the last 20 years, PEP has reduced its share count by 20% through persistent share buyback programs. This has further ensured upward movement in the stock.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMaking PepsiCo an even more compelling investment is its generous dividend, which yields 2.8%.

One way to take advantage is to buy the best forever stocks that will grow sales and earnings for decades. Typically, these stocks have wide moats and durable brands that protect them against competition. Also, they have a proven record of sustaining their profits through economic cycles, outperforming the market.So, how do you identify the best forever stocks to buy? First, they sell everyday products or services with minimal disruption risks. While technology might improve their operations, it doesn’t pose risks of obsoleting their products. For instance, confectioners delight their customers with chocolates. AI won’t change customers’ preferences for their trusted tasty products.Secondly, these stocks benefit from the Lindy effect, a principle popularized by statistician Nicholas Taleb. It states that the longer a product has been in use, the longer its future life expectancy. Usually, top forever stocks sell products that have been in the market for decades. This longevity assists in capturing consumer mind share and developing crucial business relationships.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFinally, these long-term investment stocks have impenetrable moats making them profit machines with robust cash flows. Like clockwork, they reinvest their surplus cash flows into research, talent, supply chains, and market distribution. With each investment, they gradually strengthen their product quality, enhance their network effects and boost economies of scale. As a result, they end up in monopolies or duopolies with limited competition to disrupt their businesses.So, here are some blue-chip forever stocks that have endured recessions, wars, and political turmoil. Due to their utility-like products and strong customer loyalty, they will likely thrive for decades.Hershey (HSY)Hershey's milk chocolate pieces on a white plate on top of a wooden tableSource: shutterstock.com/VG FotoIf you are a chocolate fan, you have certainly come across Hershey’s (NYSE:HSY) products. Alongside Mars, these two giants dominate the North American confectionery market. Since its founding in 1927, Hershey has delighted its customers with products like Hershey’s, Reese’s, and Kisses.Story continuesWhether in an economic crisis or pandemic, consumers always crave a taste of their favorite chocolate bars. And every Halloween season, kids engage in the curious hunt for tasty treats creating a lasting brand connection. Consumers’ strong affinity for Hershey’s chocolate products and other snacks has made it a staple in most households.These consumer habits have driven revenue growth for decades allowing the company to reinvest and bring new and better products to market. In the U.S. market, the company is the leader in market share at 33.5%. Also, it has recently diversified into cheese puffs, pretzels, and popcorn through several acquisitions.After years of consistent growth, Hershey has grown into a behemoth with annual revenues of $10.4 billion. In the last five years, revenues increased at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7%. Meanwhile, diluted EPS grew at a 15.82% CAGR in the previous three years.Despite its size, Hershey is still one of the top high-potential forever stocks to buy. Notably, Hershey is still growing sales volume organically. While other packaged food companies relied on price increases for growth in the last quarter as volumes declined, Hershey bucked the trend. Management announced organic volume growth of 3.3%.Yes, chocolate seems boring compared to tech stocks in AI or the cloud. But sometimes, in investing, keeping it simple wins. People aren’t going to stop consuming chocolate. That’s why it has been one of the best forever stocks returning 178% in the last five years.Waste Management (WM)person depositing a plastic water bottle in a yellow plastic recycling bin. The bin is in a line-up of several other blue and green bins.Source: shutterstock.com/PhotoByToRGarbage collection is an essential utility that consumers and governments always need. And with the proliferation of consumerism and e-commerce, the amount of waste has only increased. Waste Management (NYSE:WM) serves the waste collection, disposal, and recycling market, making it one of the best forever stocks to buy now.The Houston, Texas-based company is the largest garbage collection company in America. It owns or operates over 259 landfill sites in U.S. and Canada. The company has expanded its presence in North America through bolt-on acquisitions. For instance, its $4.6 billion acquisition of Advanced Disposal in 2020 added 41 landfills and 3 million customers.So, why is Waste Management a forever stock to buy? First, the numerous regulatory hurdles make trash hauling a defensible business with limited competition. Obtaining permits and environmental approvals for a new landfill takes a lot of work. After all, nobody wants a landfill in their backyard. Due to these regulatory and political obstacles, Waste Management’s existing landfills are an irreplaceable asset.Secondly, it has strong pricing power because 60% of its contracts have provisions for price increases. Thirdly, the company owns its landfills. 70% of the waste it collects is disposed of on its landfill sites. As a result of this vertical integration, the company derives higher operating and profit margins.Given the essential nature of garbage collection and disposal, the substantial barriers to entry, and higher profit margins, WM stock is one of the top forever stocks to buy. And TipRanks analysts agree with an average price target of $174.78.PepsiCo (PEP)Cans of PepsiCo's Pepsi soda are in a bucket of ice.Source: suriyachan / Shutterstock.comSnacks are an indispensable part of the family diet. No other company dominates the category like PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP). In FY2022, its snacks business accounted for 58% of revenues. Complementing the snacks business is an equally robust global beverage business.Since it dominates the convenience foods category, PepsiCo’s snacks business is a stable growth driver. It is the market leader and brought in $50 billion in revenues in FY2022. The business includes brands such as Lay’s, Doritos, Tostitos, Ruffles, Cheetos Aunt Jemima, Cap’n Crunch, and Quaker Oatmeal.In terms of the carbonated soft drink business, it’s the second largest player behind Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). Essentially, these two operate as a duopoly. And although PepsiCo is the smaller player, it has led in many markets powered by drinks such as Pepsi, Mountain Dew, and Gatorade.Despite the strength of its brands and the breadth of its portfolio, PepsiCo is accelerating investments in its brands. As management highlighted in CAGNY 2023 conference, they have increased advertising and marketing by 24% in the last four years. Additionally, they have increased capital investment in capacity and supply chain, digital solutions, and go-to-market strategies.Due to these investments, PepsiCo has compounded revenues at 8.9% over the last three years. First quarter 2023 results were equally impressive, showing 14.3% organic revenue growth. Frito Lay North America had an astounding performance registering $5.5 billion in sales, a 16% YOY organic growth. It’s no surprise that analysts consider PepsiCo as one of the best forever stocks to buy.PepsiCo is a meaty forever business due to its number one position in snacks and duopoly in soft drinks. Besides, its global scale allows it to wring out numerous operating efficiencies. Finally, as my colleague Will Ashworth recently noted, it’s a dividend aristocrat that will keep rewarding shareholders from its increasing cash flows.On the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

As a result, grieving children can be left lacking in fundamental building blocks of growth. Giving them permission to be kids again-to sing at the top of their lungs, to focus their entire beings on the score of a game, and to explore the boundless freedom of unstructured time-can reignite their childhoods.Dedicated to exploring this concept, Experience Camps is a nonprofit organization that transforms the lives of grieving children through summer camp programs and innovative, year-round initiatives. Funding from the Quest Diagnostics Foundation as part of the Quest for Health Equity (Q4HE) initiative is helping Experience Camps establish summer programs in the Baltimore area in coordination with other community leaders. The one-week, overnight summer camps for children who have experienced the death of a sibling, parent, or primary caregiver aims to empower campers with the necessary coping skills to move forward with their lives.""We are so proud to work with Experience Camps,"" said Michael Floyd, Senior Director and Leader, Q4HE. ""Their initiatives to help support children dealing with grief are so important. Their work has already made an impact in many communities, and we look forward to supporting this summer's camps in Baltimore to bring their expertise to more children in need.""Story continues""Receiving support from the Quest Diagnostics Foundation has helped our program expand to touch more lives in Baltimore,"" said Sara Deren, CEO of Experience Camps.

(NYSE:AMP) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 84% of the company",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ameriprise-financial-inc-nyse-amp-140025790.html,1686837625,STORY,['AMP'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Ameriprise Financial's stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsThe top 17 shareholders own 51% of the companyUsing data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a companyTo get a sense of who is truly in control of Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE:AMP), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 84% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Ameriprise Financial. Check out our latest analysis for Ameriprise Financial ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Ameriprise Financial?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Ameriprise Financial already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Ameriprise Financial's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Ameriprise Financial. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 13% of shares outstanding. With 8.9% and 4.4% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 17 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Ameriprise FinancialThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that Ameriprise Financial, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$105m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 15% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

331,b437c56c-abe0-3b6d-afc6-db98bdea0327,CSCO,2023-06-16,"Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) rises 4.5% this week, taking five-year gains to 40%",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-systems-nasdaq-csco-rises-110020498.html,1686913220,STORY,['CSCO'],"[The main point of investing for the long term is to make money. Better yet, you'd like to see the share price move up more than the market average. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) share price is up 20% in the last five years, that's less than the market return. Looking at the last year alone, the stock is up 20%.Since the stock has added US$9.2b to its market cap in the past week alone, let's see if underlying performance has been driving long-term returns. View our latest analysis for Cisco Systems In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During the last half decade, Cisco Systems became profitable. That's generally thought to be a genuine positive, so we would expect to see an increasing share price. Given that the company made a profit three years ago, but not five years ago, it is worth looking at the share price returns over the last three years, too. Indeed, the Cisco Systems share price has gained 13% in three years. In the same period, EPS is up 3.5% per year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 4% average annual increase in the share price (over three years, again). So you could reasonably conclude that investor sentiment towards the stock has remained pretty steady, over time. Arguably the share price is reflecting the earnings per share.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Cisco Systems, it has a TSR of 40% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Cisco Systems shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 24% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 7% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. Before spending more time on Cisco Systems it might be wise to click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling shares.We will like Cisco Systems better if we see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

This makes the graphic processing unit (GPU) maker the fifth publicly traded U.S. company following Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon, which have a valuation of more than trillion dollars as of Jun 14.NVIDIA has been on a remarkable run since the beginning of 2023, with its share prices soaring 196% year to date (YTD) on hopes that the company will be a prime beneficiary of growing investments in generative artificial intelligence (AI).What’s Driving the Stock Higher?Though AI has been around for years, the meteoric rise of OpenAI’s ChatGPT has captivated the world’s attention on the power of generative AI to augment human capability, suggesting that the AI boom may just get started.Generative AI is a type of AI technology that can produce various types of content, including text, imagery, audio and synthetic data. It is driven by a large language model, which means it uses a lot of data to understand and generate conversations.NVIDIA Corporation PriceNVIDIA Corporation PriceNVIDIA Corporation price | NVIDIA Corporation QuoteThe growing demand to modernize the workflow across industries is expected to drive the demand for generative AI applications. The global generative AI market size is anticipated to reach $109.37 billion by 2030, according to a new report by Grand View Research. The market is expected to expand at a CAGR of 35.6% from 2023 to 2030.The adoption of ChatGPT among enterprises has already proven generative AI technology’s usefulness across multiple industries, including marketing, advertising, customer service, education, content creation, healthcare, automotive, energy &amp; utilities and video game development.The proven success of generative AI has sparked competition among software makers, including Salesforce CRM, Cisco CSCO and Adobe ADBE, to integrate the technology into their products. However, generative AI requires vast knowledge to create content and needs huge computational power. As a result, enterprises looking to create generative AI-based applications will require to upgrade their existing network infrastructure.Story continuesNVIDIA’s next-generation chips with high computing power can be the top choice for enterprises. The company’s CEO, Jensen Huang, already stated during the first-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings conference call that existing data centers are insufficiently equipped to handle growing AI workloads.NVIDIA’s GPUs are already being applied in AI models, which is expanding its footprint in untapped markets like automotive, healthcare and manufacturing. The generative AI revolution is likely to create huge demand for its next-generation high computing powerful chips. NVIDIA expects its second-quarter fiscal 2024 revenues to reach $11 billion from $6.7 billion in the year-ago quarter, largely driven by surging AI investments across the data center end market.Software Giants Integrating AI ToolsSalesforce forayed into the generative AI space with the launch of Einstein GPT in March 2023. Earlier this week, the company elevated the set of its generative AI tools with the launch of the AI Cloud service. With this, the company claims to offer one-stop AI-powered solutions for enterprises looking to enhance productivity.Salesforce’s newly launched AI Cloud is a suite of services that delivers enterprise-ready real-time, open and secure generative experiences across all applications and workflows. The suite will power new capabilities across Salesforce’s products, including Einstein service, data analysis software Tableau and workplace-messaging app, Slack.Cisco’s AI and machine learning offerings encompass a wide range of computing solutions for enterprises, including a focus on cybersecurity. The company plans to enhance customer experience solutions, devices and its video conferencing platform, Webex Suite, with ML technologies, automation and generative AI features from meeting summaries to visual enhancements.The digital media solutions provider, Adobe, aggressively expanded its footprint in the generative AI space through partnerships and new solutions. Adobe has unveiled a family of generative AI models, Firefly, focused on the generation of texts and images. Per the company, Firefly will offer more precision, speed, power and ease in content creation. It will let users of various experience levels create high-quality images and stunning text effects.At present, NVIDIA sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Adobe has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).
