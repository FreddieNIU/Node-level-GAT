If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on navigating retirement living in the US, you may go to 5 Safest Places To Retire in the US.\xa0', 'Retirement may be the end of the road, but it’s rarely all that it’s made up to be. For the average American retiree, their retirement years are riddled with financial struggles, health troubles, and often, a growing sense of loneliness. A study by the Pew Research Center found that 27% of Americans aged 60 and older live alone - 11% more than senior citizens in the 130 other countries that the research encapsulated. As for financial status, the latest United States Census reported that 10.3% of Americans aged 65 and older were living in poverty. With such dire circumstances, retirement is often about taking the best pick out of the options presented.\xa0', 'Given the choice, any senior citizen would want to spend their Golden Years living in a place with a reasonable cost of living that is safe and has access to good healthcare. While such locations may be difficult to come by, they do exist. Better yet, US citizens can get a head start on retirement planning and give themselves a greater budget to work with. While the amount that you’re able to save for retirement depends on several factors - such as your income, the number of dependents you’re supporting, and your health, amongst others - it also has to do with how well you plan out your retirement.\xa0', 'A recent study by the Milken Institute stated that the ideal age at which Americans should start saving for retirement is 25 or younger. While 25 may seem too early, the math behind this is of compounding investment - the earlier you start saving, the more time you’ll be able to give your savings to grow. A Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) survey found that Americans think they need at least $1.8 million in savings for a comfortable retirement. With such a hefty amount on the savings list, the earlier you start, the better. Even if you’re not looking to amass the figure that has been attributed from the Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) survey, America’s growing cost of living is reason enough to get a head start on retirement planning.\xa0', 'Unfortunately, this isn’t always the case. According to the Milken Institute study, Baby Boomers started saving for retirement at the average age of 35, whereas Gen X began at 30. For senior citizens who are closing in on the retirement age without much in the bank, there is still hope. Many financial and investment management companies assist customers in financially securing their retirement and picks such as Mercer International Inc. (NASDAQ:MERC) and BlackRock, Inc.(NYSE:BLK) may be the answer to the financially unprepared. From portfolio management to custom financial plans, the likes of BlackRock, Inc.(NYSE:BLK) and Mercer International Inc. (NASDAQ:MERC) can help retirees plan better.\xa0', 'Once financially better off, senior citizens can afford to be pickier with their retirement destination choices - opting for places that offer a good quality of life while also being cheap and giving good value for money. All in all, a financially stable retiree can afford to consider the best places to retire in the US.\xa0', 'To facilitate present and future retirees contemplating a retirement move, we have compiled the following list of the 20 safest places to retire in the US.', 'holbox/Shutterstock.com', 'To compile this list of the 20 safest places to retire in the US, we consulted several sources including The Travel, Comerica, GOBankingRates, and U.S. News & World Report.\xa0Once a list of places was compiled using these sources, we then ranked them across multiple factors, namely, how safe they are, how they score in terms of health, their median figure for a one-bedroom rental, and their average monthly grocery bill for an individual. For this article, rental prices were taken from Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) and Zumper, grocery figures were taken from the Economic Policy Institute, health scores were taken from WalletHub’s 2023 ranking of Healthiest & Unhealthiest Cities in America, and safety scores were taken from WalletHub’s 2023 ranking of Safest Cities in America. For the healthiest cities, WalletHub used four metrics - healthcare, food, fitness, and green space. For safest cities, WalletHub used three metrics - home and community safety, natural disaster risk, and financial safety.\xa0A cumulative score was then assigned to each city where a double weightage was given to the safety score. The 20 highest-scoring cities then made up our list of the 20 safest places to retire in the US.', 'For cities that gained an equal score, their safety scores were used as a tie-breaker. The resulting list is presented in ascending order, with the highest-ranked place being presented last.\xa0\xa0It is important to remember that personal preference plays a big part. The best course of action is to visit the place you plan to move to, converse with locals, take advice from a financial consultant, and only then make your final decision.\xa0', 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend aristocrats and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 10 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats To Buy According to Analysts.\xa0', 'Investors often grapple with the decision of whether to invest in growth stocks or value stocks. While both strategies aim to enhance value for investors, they follow distinct paths. The primary distinction lies in the pricing. Growth stocks tend to be pricier, with high valuations relative to their sales or earnings. Conversely, value stocks are more affordable, with lower stock prices in comparison to their sales or earnings. Over time, both growth and value investment approaches have demonstrated comparable performance, yet historical analysis indicates that value investing has been more advantageous for investors in the long term. According to research published by Josef Lakonishok, Andrei Shleifer, and Robert W. Vishny in the Journal of Finance, value strategies tend to yield superior returns. Various investment strategies centered around purchasing undervalued stocks have consistently outperformed those focused on trendy or high-flying stocks from April 1968 to April 1990.', 'The research paper also emphasized that value stocks typically offer significantly higher dividend yields and possess stronger fundamental ratios compared to growth stocks. Both Josef Lakonishok and the value investing expert David Dreman have observed that value investing outperforms growth investing approximately 70% of the time, regardless of the size of the companies involved. Their studies, which encompassed various company sizes, revealed that value stocks consistently delivered average returns of slightly over 7% per year higher than growth stocks over extended periods.', 'As mentioned earlier, dividends are often a key component of value stocks. Among dividend strategies, one of the most popular approaches is investing in dividend aristocrats. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index tracks the performance of companies within the S&P 500 that have consistently increased their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. A report from S&P Dow Jones Indices indicated that strategies focusing on generating income often exhibit significant value characteristics. Investors typically gravitate towards securities offering high dividend yields and lower price multiples. The report also mentioned that the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index demonstrated a blend of both growth and value traits, rather than a pronounced bias towards one style. Analysis of the index composition from 1999 to 2022 revealed its style breakdown. On average, the index maintained a 59.04% exposure to value stocks and a 40.94% exposure to growth stocks during this period.', 'Despite the allure of high-priced growth stocks, value stocks have consistently proven to be advantageous for investors over the long haul. Dimensional Funds conducted an analysis spanning nearly a century, affirming that value stocks typically offer higher expected returns. While there have been occasional downturns, the fundamental principle that lower relative prices correlate with higher expected returns remains steadfast. Value premiums have often manifested swiftly and significantly. For instance, in years when value outperformed growth, the average premium amounted to nearly 15%. On average, in the US, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks by 4.4% annually from 1927 to 2022.', ""Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Emerson Electric Co.

Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual.

Generative AI is obviously getting a lot of attention right now, [and] AI in general is being prioritized by many leaders,” West told Sourcing Journal. “One of the most obvious use cases for logistics was in KPI reporting. Logistics leaders sit on a ton of data, but aren’t always able to compile, query and report on it easily.”', 'According to Gartner data, 14 percent of supply chain organizations have already implemented or are working to implement generative AI. An additional 50 percent of leaders indicated they plan to implement the technology within the next year.', 'KPIs aid logistics providers in tracking targets, efficiency and performance. Having that data can allow leaders to make more informed decisions, but in organizations that track a sprawling variety of metrics, it can prove difficult to parse through the data trove. Gartner suggested that generative AI could help highlight the most important indicators for a business.', 'West said generative AI-powered systems stand to improve the ease of querying information—especially in terms that make sense to the user.', '“For most logistics leaders, this isn’t easily done today without building reporting or leveraging their own data analysts or building something in a visualization tool. [Generative AI] will speed up the KPI reporting process,” she explained.', 'But in order to see the best outcomes from technology, enterprises need to ensure the data they enter into the systems is the best quality it can be, West warned.', '“Data quality is absolutely critical. We’ve heard it a million times before: garbage in, garbage out. Your reporting will only be as good as your data. If you’re measuring [or] reporting on performance and the data being used to measure isn’t accurate, then you break trust and can drive unintended actions with poor outcomes,” she said.', 'To mitigate data-based issues, West said, supply chain and logistics organizations should consider embedding data governance structures and working on data management and quality strategies.', 'KPIs may not be the only function of the supply chain altered by emerging technologies. Gartner also predicts that by 2028, there will be more smart robots than frontline workers in manufacturing, retail and logistics.', 'But the reason may not be aligned with at-large fears over job loss. Gartner said the reason for that prediction is due to labor shortages.', 'In line with that trend, retention in warehouses and manufacturing facilities has become crucial. Gartner said by 2028, it anticipates 40 percent of all large warehouse operations will deploy tools to engage their employees. That could help motivate the workforce and may, in turn, drive higher retention rates.', 'As supply chain players continue to evaluate the best use cases for AI in their organizations, they may need to consider whether to build their own models and tools or buy systems operated by a third-party provider.', 'For many small-to-medium companies, the former could be a major challenge. West said most ordinary companies may want to consider working with providers to streamline the AI implementation process.', '“Highly mature organizations might have the technology, the data and the talent to develop and customize gen AI solutions. However, lower-maturity organizations might lack one or more of these requirements and should consider embedded offerings of technology or service providers they work with,” she noted.']"

Happy to be here.', 'JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, I want to talk about this acquisition, first of all. You all acquiring CrownRock. It was announced back in December.', ""And of course, you're not the only one. We've seen this spate of acquisitions in the industry. What is this all about? What is the goal here in acquiring CrownRock?"", ""VICKI HOLLUB: I think every company has their own set of goals for us. In the Permian Basin, we had a very large position in the Delaware. And that position was gave us the scale we need to bring the efficiencies of not just the proximity, but the size of what we're doing there."", 'So Delaware basin was fine. We wanted to apply the same model to the Midland basin. But we had a position that was pretty small in the Midland', 'Basin. So acquiring CrownRock gives us a little more scale. The scale also is in the right position. So it was a perfect fit with the assets that we already had.', 'And in addition, it brought with it an inventory. That actually helps to improve our inventory by fitting into tier one of the prospects that we have to drill in the future. So that was important.', ""And the other thing is it does bring forward cash flow. So part of the way we'll pay for some of the acquisition is to sell some of our oil and gas areas that are further out in terms of development and time. So this is an acceleration of value to our shareholders, improving our inventory, giving us the opportunity to become much more efficient in the Midland."", 'JULIE HYMAN: And how is the timeline looking for selling off those assets that you mentioned to help fund this transaction?', ""VICKI HOLLUB: Yeah, we expect to meet our timeline that we laid out. And that's 12 months past timeline for the initial phase. And then by 18 months, we'll have everything that we need to finalize what we want to do with the acquisition."", ""JULIE HYMAN: And should investors think of this. I mean, when you talk about scale, you're not just talking about scale, you're also talking about efficiency, you're talking about profitability of these various shale areas. So should investors think of this as a 1 plus 1 equals 2, or some exponential exponent of that?"", ""VICKI HOLLUB: It'll be 1 plus 1 equals more than 2. Because with what we'll be able to do with the efficiencies that we create will create more value not only from that particular development, but again, it's the acceleration of value to the shareholders that from an NPV basis is much better."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Now, I talked to one analyst after this transaction who talked about wondering if this is a sign Occidental is moving a little bit back towards a low shareholder return phase. And he was wondering when you'll get back to a sort of higher shareholder return phase. Can you talk to us about how you're thinking about that?"", ""VICKI HOLLUB: If the shareholder return that he's talking about is buybacks, then yes, we will in the near-term over the next couple of years, we'll continue to pay debt down. Post those two years, we'll get back to repurchasing shares. We've had a very healthy repurchase program over the last couple of years because of the fact that our stock right now is very undervalued in our view."", 'And so we think that the two important ways to return value to shareholders are through a growing dividend, which the CrownRock acquisition does for us and to repurchase shares. But also, we get a really good return on capital employed by investing organically in our oil and gas development. So those three things are the way that we can continue to create value for our shareholders.', 'JULIE HYMAN: I want to talk about another big project that you all are working on. And this is on the energy transition front direct air capture, which is effectively pulling CO2 out of the air and trying to bury it underground sequestering it. This is something that I believe Occidental fairly uniquely is doing in the oil and gas business.', ""Why did you decide to go that route versus capturing the CO2 that comes from the oil and gas processes? And what's the long-term outlook for this?"", ""VICKI HOLLUB: Well we've actually been using CO2 for enhanced oil recovery for more than 50 years. And so that's a core competence of us. We know how CO2 works."", 'We know how to manage it. We know how to deal with it. We have the infrastructure for it in the Permian Basin.', ""And so for a long time, we were trying to capture anthropogenic CO2 from industry. But that's a difficult process. Because when you're trying to get an industrial site to commit, to putting retrofitting equipment on their facility to capture carbon, that's not an easy negotiation. It's not an easy agreement to get to."", ""And quite frankly, we started back in 2008 trying to make that happen. We couldn't make it happen with anybody. And then we came across this Carbon Engineering technology to extract CO2 out of the atmosphere."", ""When we found that technology, that was more like the Holy Grail for us, because now we didn't have to talk to any emitters. All we had to do, and we controlled our own destiny with our schedule in terms of what pace we could develop these at and how well we could develop the direct air capture. And that allows us to do it when and where it makes sense to do."", ""And the other thing about that technology is that just so happens that it's potassium hydroxide that will extract the CO2 out of the air. We're the largest marketer of potassium hydroxide in the US, second largest in the world. And to make the mixing happen in the contact tower so that you get the most efficiency and pull the most CO2 out of the air."", 'You have to have the mixing happen in a good way. And PVC will help that will be the diffuser in the tower. And we make PVC, too. So not only did we have the synergy with our oil and gas business of having used CO2 in enhanced oil recovery, but also the synergies with the infrastructure that we have as a result of that and then the synergies with chemicals. And it was like this was meant for us to do.', ""JULIE HYMAN: When is it going to make money? What's the timeline? Because it's the economics of it. And not just with direct air capture, but with your rivals are doing. It's quite difficult."", ""VICKI HOLLUB: Actually, we will have the first phase of Stratus which is our direct air capture facility that we're building in the Permian. That will be up starting up in mid next year. We've already sold about 70% of the carbon reduction credits for that 500,000 tons per year that will ultimately have for that facility. And that's been going well."", 'There is a demand from airlines, from tech companies, and even from a consulting company and some others that want to reduce their carbon footprint. This is the voluntary compliance market. These are people who care about their carbon footprint, and who want to make a difference, want to offset that carbon footprint.', ""They're buying these credits. So we will have cash flow coming in from that facility."", 'JULIE HYMAN: When do you think it will pay for itself and actually get into the black?', ""VICKI HOLLUB: The payout really is dependent on what the credits are beyond what we've sold out today. We've done a really good job. And so we haven't sold them all."", ""But the cost of credits right now are going up because there's a limited number of reduction credits that companies can buy. So I hope to be able to tell you in two years exactly what that looks like. But it's evolving."", ""JULIE HYMAN: We'll check back in with you."", ""VICKI HOLLUB: It's evolving and going well actually."", 'JULIE HYMAN: Vicki Hollub, thanks so much.

The classic example of that being 2007, 2008 when the oil price tripled in price."", ""But you certainly couldn't validate that there was a demand backdrop, which actually created that. So this move certainly, initially is very technical. We completed a bullish outside week on oil last week. And in fact on WTI, that's the second one in the last three weeks. But outside of that, you haven't seen this development since April of 2022. And when we got that in April 2022, oil ended up going significantly higher in the following eight weeks."", ""And we also posted this bullish outside week in Brent crude last week, which is the first one that we've actually seen on that since April 2022. So big technical developments and breaking out of the three month trading range and the weekly reversals suggest that we can continue to push higher. We have some good levels around 8350 on WTI and 89 on Brent. But if we get through those levels, then there could be a real danger that we could be pushing even further to topside towards 95 to 97."", ""And think what's going to be very important is figuring out the ultimate reasonings for this because the feedback loop depending on that can be very different."", 'BRAD SMITH: Yeah. Tom, I mean, we think back to April 2022. And remember what was happening that also influenced some of the price action there. It was geopolitical conflict. It was Russia Ukraine. Are we just one exogenous event away from seeing another massive spike in oil?', ""It's a valid point. But I mean, who knows what tail risks are out there. But sometimes price action tells you what we are susceptible to. And if there was a new event that would certainly suggest that given the way price action is already trading that the up move could accelerate to the top side. But with outside those events, I think we'd have to look at this and say that this doesn't necessarily indicate we'd see a move of that magnitude. And this doesn't come off the low of the trend either."", ""So it's not as an aggressive reversal as we would have seen then when oil was already moving down. Whereas we've already moved up about 20%. So it is important if we do get another event. But I would suggest that this dynamic that we're seeing at the moment is very much absent that event. And while it's been a good push of about 20% since December, it doesn't yet rise to the significance of what we saw back in 2022."", 'SEANA SMITH: Tom when we take a look at a lot of the M&A activity in the fourth quarter of 2023, record $144 billion worth of deals were signed for energy producers that was according to the latest data here from inverse. What does that tell us just about the setup then for 2024 and whether or not we could expect a further uptick in deals within the space.', ""I mean, at the end of the day at a minimum, what it tells you is that fossil fuels are not dead, the transition in terms of fossil fuels to alternative forms of energy, certainly been a main focus. But that takes time. That takes investment. And in a global economy where a lot of countries are already very stretched in terms of their fiscal position, you're already seeing a scenario where that may take a transition period longer than people had previously thought."", ""So as a consequence, you're sitting at an oil price that's back to where it was a year ago. You're sitting in an oil price that from an historic perspective, no it's not at the 2008 highs or not even at the highs, we saw after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. But at 80, 85, 90, $95. It's certainly at very elevated levels compared to what we've seen on a multitude of occasions in the last 10 to 15 years."", ""And as I guess as a backdrop when people look at that. They look at the geopolitical tensions that Brad has talked about. They look at the underlying dynamic of the overall economy where we're probably producing as much as we can potentially produce. And they see where the oil price is. That feedback loop probably suggests to them that seems to be a very resilient commodity and therefore an area on that basis that's probably worth continuing to look at from an investment perspective."", ""BRAD SMITH: To what extent do you expect what we're monitoring within the oil market and Brent crude. Even for the assets and review over at BlackRock at the top end of their 2024 range at this juncture to what extent does this all pass into the Fed and what they're going to be discussing this weekend and moving forward?"", ""TOM FITZPATRICK: I think that's a hugely interesting topic because often people look at the oil price and they think oil price up. That's interest rates up. Oil price down, interest rates down. Inflation, disinflation. What's much more important and I think particularly for policymakers is to identify why the oil price is doing what it's doing. If you go back to 2022, when oil prices surged."", ""Let's not forget that oil prices were surging at the same time as we had the biggest fiscal and monetary stimulus in the history of mankind. At the same time when employment was picking up quite dramatically and the savings rate was growing exponentially due to that fiscal stimulus. So the economy was recovering, the amount of money and free money in the economy was abundant."", ""And therefore rising oil price was not really a drag. But fast forward to today if you do not believe that this oil price move is a function of some significant pick up in economic activity. And I would suggest looking at China, Japan, Europe out on the borders of Ossetian. US real growth high but nominal growth falling. It doesn't look like a very demand driven move. And therefore it's no different from a tax hike."", 'And you would not raise interest rates or you would not get more aggressive in terms of your monetary policy if prices were pushing higher because of a tax hike. So sure it has a danger of showing up in headline inflation. But with unemployment rising with the savings rate lower, with salary increases moderating. What it feels like a lot of people tapped out, this is far more likely to result in a substitution effect we already see very weak retail sales coming through.', ""And an underlying drag on the economy. So we've seen the ECB plenty of times in the past make the mistake of reacting to dynamics that were only due to a non demand driven move in the oil price. I don't think we will see the Fed do that. I think they will be looking through that dynamic because if anything this has the potential to be disinflationary at the core."", 'If it means that spending, which is not really discretionary in terms of oil, takes away from the ability for people to spend and at a time when mortgage rates are close to 7% and interest rates are much higher. So I think the Fed needs to be prepared to back from this and not be looking at this as something they should be reacting to at this point.', ""BRAD SMITH: Tom really great insights and analysis. Thanks so much for taking the time to have the conversation with us today. Tom Fitzpatrick, Andre O'Brien global market insights managing director. Appreciate it.""]"

This surge in construction activity is expected to catalyze a multi-year growth phase for leading infrastructure stocks. Concerns have long persisted regarding the aging infrastructure of the country. In November 2021, President Joe Biden took action by signing the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) to tackle this issue head-on. This legislation has paved the way for numerous infrastructure projects across the nation. To date, over 46,000 projects have received funding approval, encompassing a wide range of infrastructure developments, including advanced rapid transit corridors, harbor enhancements, water system upgrades, bridge renovations, airport expansions, railway tunnel constructions, fiber broadband installations, and port improvements. With a staggering $1.2 trillion allocated for spending, the top electrical infrastructure stocks stand to benefit significantly from this investment.', ""In terms of electricity generation, changes in policy, market conditions, and technological advancements are leading to significant transformations in fuel sources. These shifts are exerting new demands and challenges on the US electric grid, since the majority of the country's high-voltage transmission infrastructure dates back to the 1960s and 1970s and was not designed to support the current or projected future requirements of the grid. That said, currently the US electric grid supplies over 3,800 terawatt-hours of electricity to approximately 159 million residential, commercial, and industrial consumers."", 'However, looking toward the future, the utilities sector finds itself at the forefront of the transition from carbon-based fuels to renewable energy sources. In the first half of 2023, the energy sector witnessed a significant shift, marked by the largest proportion of private sector involvement in infrastructure projects, according to the World Bank. Notably, renewable energy sources dominated the landscape, with 99% of new energy projects dedicated to renewable sources.\xa0 The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, the aforementioned Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and the CHIPS and Science Act are anticipated to accelerate this transition by incentivizing the adoption of clean-energy alternatives and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, with forecasts indicating a potential doubling of the portion of US power generation from renewable sources by 2030.', 'In light of this, investors would do well to keep some of the best electrical infrastructure stocks on their radars, seeing as these companies are exposed to infrastructure spending in the US.

That includes the process of developing the technology — a stage known as training – and the running of it, which is called inference.', 'The Blackwell chips, which are made up of 208 billion transistors, will be the basis of new computers and other products being deployed by the world’s largest data center operators — a roster that includes Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Oracle Corp. Blackwell-based products will be available later this year, Nvidia said.', 'Blackwell — named after David Blackwell, the first Black scholar inducted into the National Academy of Science — has a tough act to follow. Its predecessor, Hopper, fueled explosive sales at Nvidia by building up the field of AI accelerator chips. The flagship product from that lineup, the H100, has become one of the most prized commodities in the tech world — fetching tens of thousands of dollars per chip.', 'The growth has sent Nvidia’s valuation soaring as well. It is the first chipmaker to have a market capitalization of more than $2 trillion and trails only Microsoft and Apple Inc. overall.', 'The announcement of new chips was widely anticipated, and Nvidia’s stock was up 79% this year through Monday’s close.

Huang told CNBC on Tuesday that Blackwell chips will be in a similar range.', 'The new design has so many transistors — the tiny switches that give semiconductors their ability to store and process information — that it’s too big for conventional production techniques. It’s actually two chips married to each other through a connection that ensures they act seamlessly as one, the company said. Nvidia’s manufacturing partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., will use its 4NP technique to produce the product.', 'Why Nvidia’s New Blackwell Chip Is Key to AI: QuickTake', 'Blackwell will also have an improved ability to link with other chips and a new way of crunching AI-related data that speeds up the process. It’s part of the next version of the company’s “superchip” lineup, meaning it’s combined with Nvidia’s central processing unit called Grace. Users will have the choice to pair those products with new networking chips — one that uses a proprietary InfiniBand standard and another that relies on the more common Ethernet protocol. Nvidia is also updating its HGX server machines with the new chip.', 'The Santa Clara, California-based company got its start selling graphics cards that became popular among computer gamers. Nvidia’s graphics processing units, or GPUs, ultimately proved successful in other areas because of their ability to divide up calculations into many simpler tasks and handle them in parallel. That technology is now graduating to more complex, multistage tasks, based on ever-growing sets of data.', 'Blackwell will help drive the transition beyond relatively simple AI jobs, such as recognizing speech or creating images, the company said. That might mean generating a three-dimensional video by simply speaking to a computer, relying on models that are have as many as 1 trillion parameters.', 'For all its success, Nvidia’s revenue has become highly dependent on a handful of cloud computing giants: Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Meta Platforms Inc. Those companies are pouring cash into data centers, aiming to outdo their rivals with new AI-related services.', 'The challenge for Nvidia is broadening its technology to more customers. Huang aims to accomplish this by making it easier for corporations and governments to implement AI systems with their own software, hardware and services.', 'Huang’s speech kicks off a four-day GTC event that’s been called a “Woodstock” for AI developers.

As such, demand for Apple's luxury hardware devices stalled. This dynamic has taken a major toll on Apple's growth, as revenue has been on the decline for several consecutive quarters.

On the other hand, many have been saying that for years, only to see these tech giants surpass earnings expectations.', 'How to balance their relatively high market valuations with their above-average growth prospects? One valuation metric touted by one of the most famous mutual fund managers of all time may hold the secret.', 'The PEG ratio, or price-to-earnings-to-growth metric, was first developed in 1969 by Mario Farina and later popularized by Peter Lynch, portfolio manager for the Fidelity Magellan Fund in the 1980s.', ""To calculate the PEG ratio, an investor should divide a company's P/E ratio by its expected earnings growth rate. In general, stocks may have a PEG ratio between 1 and 2, with stocks with PEGs under 1 considered undervalued, and stocks above 2 considered overvalued."", 'A PEG ratio is an imperfect measure, to be sure, as some investors may use either the trailing or forward P/E ratio, and others use different lengths of time to calculate the long-term earnings growth numbers.', ""One standard type of PEG ratio is to look at the P/E ratio based on current year expected earnings, and the outlook for the next five years' earnings growth."", ""Here's how the PEG ratios the Magnificent Seven stocks shake out."", 'Company', 'PEG Ratio', 'Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)', '1.10', 'Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)', '1.36', 'Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG)', '1.49', 'Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)', '1.93', 'Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)', '2.11', 'Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)', '2.12', 'Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)', '2.36', 'Data source: Yahoo! Finance.', 'There are a few expected results here, but also a few surprises. First, it\'s not surprising to see both Meta and Alphabet among the cheapest of these stocks. These two generally trade at discounts to other ""disruptive"" tech names, perhaps because of their already being large, ""mature"" companies. Moreover, many investors give less credit to revenue and profits that come from advertising, as ad revenue is thought to be economically sensitive and perhaps flighty.', 'Still, that has been the case for years, and both Alphabet and Meta have generally been able to defy skeptics and continue solid growth over the long term as ad dollars continue to flow to digital ads from traditional advertisements.', 'In addition, Alphabet has lots of cash on its balance sheet and generates significant losses from its ""Other Bets"" segment, increasing its P/E ratio relative to its core business and making it look more expensive. And since it\'s really hard to know whether some of Alphabet\'s moonshot projects will pay off, analysts probably aren\'t forecasting any contribution from these loss-making but forward-thinking businesses, perhaps underrating Alphabet\'s earnings growth prospects even further.', ""And of course, besides a reasonable valuation, Meta's new dividend is a good sign of confidence management has in the sustainability of its earnings. Thus, both of these stocks may be worth looking at if contemplating allocating to Magnificent Seven stocks today."", ""One big surprise here is Nvidia, which actually comes out as the second cheapest stock based on this measure. That's despite having the highest trailing P/E ratio at 73.5. That is, of course, because analysts are forecasting robust growth for Nvidia based on its lead in GPUs that currently dominate the artificial intelligence market. From the looks of it, it appears analysts believe that advantage will continue, and that the AI revolution will deliver sustainable high growth for Nvidia over the immediate term."", 'Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon are all near 2 or above in terms of their PEG ratios, making them generally unattractive on this metric.', ""However, that doesn't necessarily mean one should avoid these stocks. Remember, the PEG ratio is just one indication, based on future earnings growth that is somewhat unknowable."", 'Moreover, each of these companies have slightly different reasons for their high PEG ratios. Both Microsoft and Apple are generally given high valuations, not necessarily because of growth, but rather because of the stability of their businesses and the confidence that earnings will generally remain intact for a long time. Apple obviously has among the best consumer franchises in the world with the iPhone, making it not only a tech stock but more of a consumer staple. And consumer staples stocks generally trade at higher valuations despite lower growth, because of their perceived ""safety"" in good economic environments and bad.', ""Microsoft is also regarded as a very safe stock, because of its dominance of not one but several high-profit businesses, including the Windows operating system, the Office enterprise software suite, and its Azure cloud computing platform. Add in its exclusive arrangement with OpenAI, and it's perhaps no wonder Microsoft is given a high valuation that may be deserved."", 'On the other hand, the high PEGs for Amazon and Tesla probably have to do with their high multiples today and the substantial uncertainty to their future earnings.', 'Amazon has typically spent all or most of its profit on future innovation, so its bottom line is incredibly difficult to project, even if the company generally does well. It\'s likely that Wall Street analysts aren\'t projecting much profit inflection, as is the case for Alphabet\'s ""other bets,"" since Amazon hasn\'t really ever harvested profit in a significant way.', ""Meanwhile, Tesla is a pioneer in the emerging electric vehicle market, which has high growth expectations over the long term. However, that market has slowed in recent months amid high interest rates, and Tesla's earnings are actually currently declining as it cuts prices."", 'The combination of high long-term growth expectations in the face of a likely earnings decline this year means Tesla is quite risky. In fact, I would personally own Amazon over Tesla, despite the slightly higher PEG, since I think Amazon is more likely to see profit inflect upward relative to current analyst expectations than Tesla.', ""The PEG ratio can be useful in offering a very quick snapshot of a company's valuation relative to its growth. However, one factor the PEG ratio doesn't capture very well is a business' safety compared with other stocks. P/E ratios are a reflection of both growth expectations and risk, but risk is a very squishy and difficult concept to quantify."", ""Moreover, the greatest stock gains usually come from businesses that wildly outperform expectations, so using a metric that merely reflects expectations is also a limiting factor. That's why the PEG ratio is best used for companies with stable earnings growth, and not a bottom line that may bounce around year to year such as Amazon or Tesla."", ""Overall, the PEG ratio is just one shortcut for investors. But remember, a company's intrinsic value is always the present value of future cash flows. If you come across a company that looks cheap based on a PEG ratio, see if you can dig deeper and map out what you think cash flow can do over the next decade, as well as the probability that your projected scenario will unfold."", ""While the PEG ratio is a useful shortcut, remember that it's more a starting point than a destination."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Following a challenging year in 2022, which saw all three major stock indexes plunge into respective bear markets, the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average, benchmark S&P 500, and innovation-driven Nasdaq Composite have all launched to new all-time highs in 2024."", ""There isn't just one factor that can be pointed to as the fuel for Wall Street's epic rally. Rather, it's a confluence of factors that includes a strong U.S. economy, better-than-expected corporate earnings, the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) as a next-big-thing trend, and a historically robust level of share repurchase activity."", 'Although aggregate corporate share buybacks in 2023 fell from the record levels observed during the 2022 bear market, the $787.3 billion S&P 500 companies collectively spent on share repurchases on a trailing-12-month basis, as of Sept. 30, 2023, remains well above the historic average.', 'The reason public companies enact share repurchase programs is threefold:', 'For companies with steady or growing net income, a steady reduction in the number of outstanding shares can increase earnings per share (EPS) over time. In other words, it can make a company appear more fundamentally attractive to investors.', 'When a public company retires shares of its common stock, the ownership stakes of existing/long-term shareholders can increase over time. This encourages investors to have a long-term mindset.', ""It's a way for a company's board of directors to demonstrate faith in a company's long-term growth strategy."", 'While more than 56% of S&P 500 companies repurchased at least $5 million worth of their own stock during the September-ended quarter, there are a few companies that are step above the rest when it comes to buybacks.', 'Since 2013, the following three widely owned companies have collectively repurchased $1.07 trillion worth of their own stock.', ""When it comes to share repurchases, it's fair to say that tech stock Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is in a class of its own. Since initiating a share buyback program in 2013, the company has bought back about $651 billion worth of its common stock."", ""To put this into context, there are only eight companies in the S&P 500, excluding Apple, with a market cap above $651 billion. Apple could have comfortably purchased 491 of the other 499 S&P 500 companies with the amount of money it's spent buying back its stock."", ""There are a couple of reasons Apple has an abundance of cash to repurchase its stock. To start with, it's a trusted brand with an exceptionally loyal following. A survey conducted by SellCell.com in March 2021 of more than 2,000 iPhone users found that nearly 92% had no intention of switching smartphone brands with their next purchase."", ""Innovation is the other big reason Apple has been nothing short of a cash cow. Domestically, Apple's iPhone has accounted for 50% or more of smartphone market share since becoming 5G-capable in 2020."", ""However, Apple's future rests with innovation beyond the physical realm. Specifically, CEO Tim Cook has been emphasizing a shift toward subscription services. A subscription-driven operating model should steadily lift the company's operating margin, help smooth out some of the revenue lumpiness associated with physical product upgrade cycles, and can further enhance the benefits of the Apple product and service ecosystem."", ""While reducing its outstanding share count by 41% since 2013 has provided a lift to Apple's EPS, investors should remain diligent about digging beneath the surface when analyzing the company's growth trends. For instance, even though Apple's adjusted EPS ticked higher by $0.02 per share in fiscal 2023 (ended in September), the company's net income fell by $2.8 billion to $97 billion for the year."", ""For the moment, Apple's buybacks are helping to partially mask a stalling of its growth engine."", ""Another S&P 500 component that's turned on the proverbial jets in the buyback department in recent years is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), the parent of internet search engine Google, social media site YouTube, and autonomous driving company Waymo, among other ventures."", ""Since initiating a share repurchase program in 2015, Alphabet's stock buybacks have grown with each passing year. The $61.5 billion spent repurchasing its stock in 2023 increased its aggregate buybacks over roughly eight years to $240 billion. Alphabet has spent enough on buybacks that it could have purchased all but 28 companies within the S&P 500, not counting itself."", ""If you're wondering what's made Alphabet such a success for so long, look no further than its virtual monopoly, Google. Data from GlobalStats shows that Google has accounted for at least a 90% monthly share of global internet search dating back almost nine years. It's the obvious go-to for businesses wanting to target their message(s) to users. As a result, Google tends to enjoy premium ad-pricing power in most economic climates."", ""However, the lion's share of Alphabet's cash flow growth moving forward may well come from Google Cloud. As of the September-ended quarter, Google Cloud was the world's No. 3 cloud infrastructure service provider, with an estimated 10% share of enterprise cloud spending. More importantly, this segment generated a full-year profit in 2023 after many years of losses. Cloud services tend to produce considerably higher margins than advertising."", ""As Alphabet's outstanding share count continues to shrink, the company's sales and net income are climbing. This is a recipe for EPS growth to outpace sales growth for the foreseeable future."", ""The third juggernaut that's been putting the pedal to the medal in the buyback department for more than a decade is Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). Though I've arbitrarily cut off the start date at 2013, Microsoft has been repurchasing its stock for even longer than Apple. Since 2013, it's collectively retired around $183 billion worth of its common stock."", 'Not including itself, Microsoft has spent more on buybacks since the beginning of 2013 than the market caps of all but 41 S&P 500 companies.', ""Microsoft's continued outperformance is a function of it seamlessly blending its legacy operations with a handful of high-growth initiatives. For example, it's no secret that the growth heyday for Windows and Office have long since passed. Nevertheless, Windows still holds a 72% share of desktop operating systems worldwide. This is an exceptionally high-margin segment that generates abundant cash flow, which allows Microsoft to aggressively invest in higher-growth initiatives."", 'With regard to ""high-growth initiatives,"" I\'m primarily talking about cloud services and AI.

According to the Janus Henderson Global Dividend Index, nearly 86% of listed companies worldwide either increased or maintained their dividends. Projections from the same index indicate that dividend payouts are set to hit a new peak of $1.72 trillion this year. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) emerged as the leading dividend payer in 2023, followed closely by Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM). The overall value of corporate dividends saw a 5% increase from 2022 to 2023, totaling $1.57 trillion. Ben Lofthouse, head of global equity income at Janus Henderson, attributed this growth to robust corporate cash flow, driving dividends and share buybacks.\xa0', 'Moreover, high interest rates boosted bank margins, resulting in a record $220 billion payout to shareholders in 2023. However, this positive trend was counteracted by significant dividend cuts in the mining sector, primarily due to lower commodity prices. Although the rapid ascent of bank dividends may decelerate, declines in the mining sector are expected to have a reduced impact. Despite challenges in specific sectors, diverse industries such as vehicles, utilities, software, food, and engineering demonstrated promising growth. Geographically, Europe (excluding the UK) and Japan played pivotal roles in global dividend growth, with Europe witnessing a 10.4% increase in payouts. The United States, while making a substantial contribution to global dividend growth owing to its size, reported a growth rate in line with the global average at 5.1%. Conversely, emerging markets observed stagnant dividends, with Brazil facing substantial cuts and China experiencing lackluster growth.', ""The Federal Reserve responded to the rise in inflation, spurred by monetary easing during the COVID-19 pandemic, by steadily increasing interest rates throughout 2023. This move had significant ramifications, leading to heightened borrowing costs for companies amid escalating interest rates and inflationary pressures. S&P Global Market Intelligence reported that there was a notable 59% increase in the number of companies filing for bankruptcy in 2023, compared to the previous year, nearing levels observed during the pandemic's peak. However, the anticipated growth in regular dividends in the US market averages around 5.8%, aligning with the 10-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.7% since 2014. The energy sector leads variable dividends, driven by a shift towards performance-based shareholder return policies since 2019. In 2022, over 20 energy companies disbursed a record $20 billion in variable dividends, benefiting from elevated oil and gas prices. However, in 2023, companies favored share repurchases due to lower valuation. The size of variable dividends in 2024 will hinge on oil and gas price volatility, demand, and its impact on share prices. The five largest sectors collectively contribute nearly 40% of total dividends and 2.05% in the estimated 5.8% growth, with real estate mandated to distribute the majority of its earnings."", ""Lately, investors are showing renewed interest in dividend-paying stocks this year after a period of decline in 2023, despite robust returns in the US stock market. Last year, rising interest rates led investors to favor bonds over stocks with smaller payouts, while mega-cap tech stocks attracted attention due to artificial intelligence hype. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index saw a modest 5.7% increase compared to the broader S&P 500 total return index's 26% gain. However, with recent declines in yields and the possibility of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, dividend stocks are gaining traction again. Analysts suggest that investors are seeking stable, higher-yielding dividends amidst ongoing market volatility, particularly during an easing cycle. Companies that raise their dividends often receive favorable attention from investors, as evidenced by recent examples such as Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN) and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), whose stock prices increased following dividend hikes and share buyback announcements.

They were there in the very first day of our company. Synopsys revolutionized the chip industry with high-level design. We are going to CUDA accelerate Synopsys. We're accelerating computational lithography. One of the most important applications that nobody's ever known about in order to make chips, we have to push lithography to the limit."", 'MADISON MILLS: That was Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang moments ago. He announced software partnerships just before unveiling a new GPU chip called Blackwell at the GTC event. Joining us now is Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager Dan Morgan. Dan, thank you for being here to react to some of this news. What do you think the investor reaction should be right off the bat to the news about the Blackwell chips introduction here?', ""DANIEL MORGAN: Well, I was actually watching the telecast like you were earlier before I came on the camera. And I think everything so far has gone very positive. It's pretty much in line with expectations, Madison. Thought process coming into this, where they were going to introduce a new line of chips called Blackwell, they also mentioned the Grace Blackwell 200, which is more advanced chip. They have a whole new family of chips coming out."", ""He also talked about the superior technology in this existing chip over the current Hopper 100, which is the H100. So it kind of leads you to believe that this is something that's going to replace the current chip that's out there right now."", ""So I think what we have to gather from this, Madison and Josh, is that we've had a lot of announcements recently from a lot of different companies about new chips, AI chips that they have coming out. And I think what we're seeing is Nvidia kind of punching back with their new and greatest technology. You have to bear in mind, they have about 70% market share. So these are the guys that are playing catch up."", ""And so they want to show they're not just going to sit back and let other companies like AMD and so forth come out with chips and not respond back. So that's what I think this is a big part of. And I expect them to continue to maintain that pole position right now."", ""JOSH LIPTON: How much-- Dan, you look at this stock and just what a remarkable rally it's been, Dan. It's up about 80% already just this year. How much good news do you think we're pricing in here?"", ""DANIEL MORGAN: Well, there is a lot of good news, Josh, and the stock trades at a very high multiple. Obviously, when you look at the trail, if you look at it versus upcoming fiscal year '25, it's not a huge multiple. But at this point-- you know, I wrote a piece, who's going to be the first one to $3 trillion? Is it going to be Apple, Am-- or excuse me, Amazon or Google or Nvidia? And I think you'd have to say right now, Nvidia is in the better position just from a growth perspective."", ""So even though I expect the comparisons to slow down a little bit in terms of what they have been over the last four quarters, I still expect them to grow at a very strong rate. So, you know, Josh, when you've got a great stock like Nvidia, just got to let it run. Everybody wants to find that sell point and get out and find that perfect moment. But I still think you've got a ways to go."", ""JOSH LIPTON: So let me ask you, Dan, because some folks have-- I'm sure you've heard this, they look at the run Nvidia has had and other just AI-related names, the surge, Dan. And you've heard this reaction that it's a kind of classic stock bubble. Do you believe that, Dan? What's your response when you hear that?"", ""DANIEL MORGAN: Well, I don't believe that, Josh, because if we look at Nvidia, it's a company that we can actually see tangible evidence that AI is directly impacting profits. And there are a few other companies that we can say that about. Like today, we had the announcement with Apple and Alphabet and the Gemini AI engine. And so it's a great announcement. It sounds really good. But how are we going to parse through that? Where are we going to see actual financial results?"", ""If you think about, Josh, I've been in this business since '87, so I went through the tech bubble back in late 1999, 2000, summer of 2000. And it doesn't feel anything like that today, because you have companies that are obviously have very good earnings. They're doing very well. They have very established businesses, lots of cash on the balance sheet."", ""So I don't feel we're in dotcom or IA dotcom bubble at this point. I think we're at the beginning of something big. And there are going to be companies that aren't going to benefit from it as much as everybody thinks they are. But I think Nvidia is one that is going to benefit. And obviously, that will show up in the stock price."", ""MADISON MILLS: Well, talk to me about what stocks we can anticipate rising off of this news throughout the course of this week. We're seeing Synopsys up unsurprisingly a little over 3% here on. Nvidia, though, a little bit flat, which is a little surprising to me here. I'm curious what stocks are audience of investors on the Yahoo Finance platform should be looking at throughout the rest of the week to suss out how this news is landing?"", ""DANIEL MORGAN: Well, Madison, obviously, you're going to get a boost to AMD. We know that they have the Mi300S, Mi300X, that's their latest AI chips that they recently brought out. Also, a lot of people want to talk about Intel, but they have the Gaudi 3, which is actually going to be rolling out pretty soon. They have Falcon Shores. So they have some chips coming down the pipe."", ""You have Marvell, obviously, with their PAM DSP 4 chip. That's obviously going to-- should benefit from this. We know that Broadcom reported a couple of weeks ago. And they don't have a pure play chip, but they do have accelerators and other products that are AI-related. So those would be some of the chip players that I would expect to really benefit from the Nvidia news coming out, kind of names that we know about."", ""And then, you know, Madison and Josh, we switch it over and we look at companies that are currently developing their own chips, you don't really think of Alphabet, but they have the Tensor chip with they're developing with Broadcom. So you have a lot of these companies that are buyers of chips, AI chips, that are in the process of developing their own chip. Meta, for example, has two chips they just released a couple months ago that they're developing in the AI space that they would use as an alternative to, let's say, the H100 for Nvidia."", ""So you have kind of a force of the chip competitors. And then you have companies that use the chips that are developing their own AI chips. That should benefit from what's happening with Nvidia. So it's kind of a two-pronged attack."", 'JOSH LIPTON: Dan, always love having you on the show. Thanks as always for your time and insights.', 'DANIEL MORGAN: Thanks, Josh.']"

Below is a chart showing annual Dividends Per Share for tracking historical trends.', 'As of today, Philip Morris International Inc currently has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 5.40% and a 12-month forward dividend yield of 5.47%.

The dividend payout ratio provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. A lower ratio suggests that the company retains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of funds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2023-12-31, Philip Morris International Inc's dividend payout ratio is 0.90.  And this may suggest that the company's dividend may not be sustainable."", ""Philip Morris International Inc's profitability rank, offers an understanding of the company's earnings prowess relative to its peers.

Philip Morris International Inc's revenue has increased by approximately 7.10% per year on average, a rate that  underperforms than approximately 50%  of global competitors."", ""The company's 3-year EPS growth rate showcases its capability to grow its earnings, a critical component for sustaining dividends in the long run. During the past three years, Philip Morris International Inc's earnings increased by approximately 1.20% per year on average, a rate that  underperforms than approximately 75%  of global competitors."", ""Lastly, the company's 5-year EBITDA growth rate of 3.10%, which  underperforms than approximately 60%  of global competitors."", ""In conclusion, while Philip Morris International Inc's dividend track record is commendable, the high payout ratio raises questions about sustainability. However, the company's strong profitability rank and consistent net income provide some reassurance. The growth metrics present a mixed picture with solid revenue growth but lagging EPS and EBITDA growth rates.

Augmenix go is our new ambient AI product that addresses a very large price segment of the market, sub $600 per month and represents the vehicle by which we expect to realize significant penetration within health systems recent data from survey responses I've met Exco customers revealed that 94% of clinicians surveyed reported that I've met. Exco, helps them better focus on their patients and clinicians save up to one hour or more per day using that product. This aligns with our philosophy of enabling clinicians to see the patients and trust the technology to do its work in the background. So very early in its deployment. Initial orders have met our expectations, and we expect adoption will continue to build throughout the year and beyond.We've also been developing a version of Augmenix scope, specifically designed for the challenging conditions of the emergency department. There are very few competing products commercially deployed in this important sector of the market. We are pleased with initial results thus far and expect to make Augmenix go for the ED generally available by the end of this month. At the same time, our strategic partner, HCA Healthcare has been testing the virtually department version of Augmenix go in its own hospitals. Hca preparing to evaluate this version of Augmenix go in advance of a broad rollout across its network of hospitals. We are confident we will realize the full potential of this significant opportunity, and we'll update you as soon as we reach the next meaningful milestone at the Hims conference last week, I was on a panel with HCA and Google during which HCA delivered encouraging commentary on both the Go E, our pilot and our portfolio of products.Hca also stated its intention to deploy our solutions into are there departments within their system. Met Exco is being offered to service levels. The base level is a self-service version wearing of masks provides no human assistance in creating the Medical Note, notice automatically generated and available for review and sign off with the clinician within a minute or two following the patient encounter based version Biomedics scope is the least expensive for the customer and most scalable product among our portfolio. Premium version is called go assist at the discretion of the clinician. The draft note is simultaneously delivered to and I've NetIQ's medical documentation specialists.We've used for quality assurance and make any necessary edits before clinician sign-off. Gotoassist comes at a slightly higher price than the base version of growth. Our medics go sits alongside our live product, highest level of service where a remote medical documentation specialist is matched with a clinician throughout clinicians shift. And this leads to what is truly unique about our medical approach. Our recognition that doctors' needs are diverse and ever-changing, and we have developed the broadest portfolio of solutions to address those needs. Moreover, we offer customers fungibility across our products whereby clinicians can switch between different products and service levels to address their varying needs.This flexibility provides doctors with a higher touch level of service when they're short handed or dealing with more complex cases, while also allowing them to save on documentation costs for more routine patient encounters as Augmenix offer solutions from self-service ambient AI, two remote human support in one suite. Our systems can cover all of their documentation needs under one agreement and seamless integration process. The AI solutions in the market do not have this breadth offerings. We see a lot of AI hype and claims made by several a I own a new commerce trying to break into the market generative. Ai tools are clearly capable of doing much of the heavy lifting when it comes to medical, no documentation. However, it takes a great deal more than off-the-shelf generative AI tools to produce accurate and comprehensive medical notes consistently across a wide variety of specialties and patient encounters when harnessed properly generative.Ai has the potential to substantially ease and lower the cost of medical documentation as the pioneer in ambient virtual medical documentation. Over the past 11 years, we have built a vast repository of domain knowledge pertaining to clinician workflows and medical datasets. This knowledge has enabled us to address multiple care settings should more than 50 specialties, provide clinical decision support to the point of care at the right moment and deliver structured data that positively impacts customers' downstream activities such as billing. These key points of differentiation in conjunction with our two-way communication channel to the point of care provided a significant moat around our business.Now I'd like to discuss some of the financial highlights of our strong fourth quarter, we delivered a 45% increase in revenue to $12.7 million ahead of our most recent guidance driven by a 44% increase in conditions and service and net revenue retention of 152%. Our largest customers are increasingly adopting our high ROI products additionally, we demonstrated the scalability of our business model by increasing gross profit by 54% to $6.2 million, a 300 basis point improvement in gross margin year over year to 49.3% and driving meaningful improvement in our adjusted EBITDA and GAAP operating losses.We also bolstered our capital resources through our November equity offering, which generated over $26 million in net proceeds to further solidify our leadership position in our industry by expanding our commercial and engineering teams to enable us to accelerate our growth relative to our previous plan. We have already begun to grow our team with some very strong hires. Now as we complete the expansion over the coming months, we expect to realize a payback on this spending later this year and more meaningfully in 2025, which is what we communicated during the capital raise.Our most recent capital raise has enabled us to take a more aggressive approach towards a large underpenetrated market where customers are adopting generative AI technology at an increasing rate. Our established market presence compared to a I. only newcomers will continue to serve us well, we've expanded our sales organization to bolster our efforts to land new enterprises and to further expand within our existing enterprise accounts. We believe now is the optimal time to lean into our advantages and accelerate our growth initiatives to capture market share and exploit our leadership position.This market is still in its infancy. I am confident that our portfolio approach addresses the major price points within this market will resonate with health care systems and clinicians. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Paul Ginocchio, our Chief Financial Officer, then will return with closing comments."", 'Paul Ginocchio', ""Paul, you may Let's review the quarter's financial highlights. Revenue for the three months ended December 31st, 2023 was $12.7 million, slightly better than our preliminary expectations announced in January. Growth was driven by growing adoption of live and notes by existing customers. Gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 49.3% as compared to 46.3% in the fourth quarter of 2022. In comparison to 49.5% in the third quarter of 2023. This 300 basis point improvement year on year in gross margin percentage was mainly driven by our growing scale and efficiency and also by our strategic initiative to shift US clinicians service service in the US to outside the US, gross profit growth was 54% year on year.Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $10.6 million, up 12% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 points of our gross profit growth outpacing OpEx growth resulted in a reduction of our operating losses by over $1.1 million year on year. Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $3.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to a loss of $4.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Along with this improvement in adjusted EBITDA was a year-on-year improvement in our adjusted EBITDA margin from negative 51% in the year ago quarter to negative 26% in this quarter.Note beginning this quarter, we have modified the calculation of adjusted EBITDA to remove the interest income benefit that we are now earning due to the larger cash balance after the equity financing in November 2023 as well as foreign exchange gains and losses, both of which we deem to be nonoperational in nature. All prior amounts have been recast to conform with this current presentation under the prior definition, adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2023 would have been slightly better at a loss of $2.8 million. Cash flow from operating activities was an outflow of $0.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to an outflow and outflow of $4.4 million in the fourth quarter of last year.Now turning to the full year results, total revenue was $44.9 million, an increase of 45% compared to $30.9 million. Dollar-based net revenue retention was 148% for our health enterprise customers compared to 128% in 2022. Our gross profit increased 54% to $21.5 million. We're a 48.0% gross profit margin, up from $14 million or a 45.1% gross profit margin. Operating expenses were $40.3 million compared to $36.3 million. Adjusted operating expenses, which excludes stock-based compensation in both periods, grew 11% to $37.8 million compared to $34.2 million. Gaap net loss was $19.2 million compared to $24.4 million adjusted EBITDA loss declined to $15.2 million from $19.4 million at December 31st, 2023.We had $46.2 million in cash and cash equivalents as compared to $21.3 million as of December 31st, 2022. This reflects the $26.3 million in net proceeds from the equity offering in November 2023 and the $11.8 million of net proceeds from the equity offering in April. Our weighted average share count for EPS for the fourth quarter was $49.0 million shares common shares outstanding, and that reflects a partial quarter of the additional $7.2 million shares we issued in November and includes the $4.375 million prefunded warrants. As of year end, our common shares outstanding plus pre-funded warrants totaled $53.0 million, assuming all of the warrants outstanding are net exercised in all of our employee options.And so ours, they're both fully vested in the money. Our net expense net exercise, we would have approximately $57.1 million shares outstanding. Overall, 2023 was a significant year for Augmenix with robust revenue growth, gross margin expansion, disciplined expense management and narrowing losses. Additionally, we meaningfully strengthened our balance sheet during the year, providing the necessary capital for us to execute our updated and accelerated strategic plans and capture a significant share of this growing opportunity.Now moving onto guidance due to the solid finish to 2023 and the trends we are seeing in 2024, we are providing revenue guidance of 60 to $62 million for the full year of 2024. Turning to the outlook for the first quarter of 2024, we expect revenue in the first quarter to be approximately $13.4 million. We expect GAAP gross margins to be lower quarter on quarter by about 300 basis points due to temporary costs from both our move to the new building in Bangladesh and a one-time up and optimization initiative in India, we expect gross margins to resume their upward trajectory in May. As we have previously stated, we anticipate go revenue to be modest during the first half of 2024.We do expect go to have a positive contribution later in the year and then do contribute more materially in 2025 in terms of modeling operating expenses to reflect the point that the deployment of the equity proceeds as we articulated during the November equity raise, our plan is to invest an incremental $9 million in 2024 versus our previous previous plan, largely in sales and marketing, but also in engineering with a modest amount in G&A combined with an increase in underlying operating expenses associated with the strong current growth of our business, it would be appropriate to expect GAAP operating expenses to be in the mid the upper $50 million range in 2024. At this point, I'd like to turn the call back to Manny for closing comments."", 'Manny Krakaris', ""Thank you, Paul. We remain committed to playing an essential role in unburden clinicians and improving the operating efficiency of health care organizations. We have built a broad portfolio of products and are positioning magnetics as an effective information data delivery platform at the point of care. This unique positioning will help ensure we continue our rapid growth well into the future. I've never been more excited about the opportunities in front of us metrics and want to thank our team and our customers for helping us deliver another quarter and full year of strong financial results. Thank you very much. With that, we'll now open it up to questions. Operator?"", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Ryan Daniels, William Blair.', 'Ryan Daniels', ""Yes, guys, thanks for all the color thus far. Congrats on the strong performance. If we look to the HCA rollout, can you give us a little bit more detail on that regarding if that's just going to be in the emergency department at first or when they go system-wide did anticipate kind of broadening that out into other specialties as well."", 'Manny Krakaris', ""Hey, Ryan, good question. So there are multiple thrusts within HCA in terms of rollout. The one that obviously we've been talking about the most is in the emergency department and as you know, we're currently deployed in four hospitals at HCA and is that deployment the plan for broadening broadening that deployment. It's going according to schedule. So we anticipate that occurring throughout the year. But beyond that, we are already seeing deployment of our products in other areas, other departments within HCRACA. and there are plans to accelerate that deployment come very soon."", 'Ryan Daniels', ""Okay. And given the operating environment in an emergency department, both kind of the KSSC. multiple doctors and noncontiguous conversations, I assume that once it's built there, you don't really have to do a lot of work to take it into other specialties or clinical areas. Is that fair?"", 'Manny Krakaris', ""Well, sort of there's some things that do overlap with other other departments. But there's there's certain things in the emerging department that are unique to the emergency department from being able to slip in and out of different patient EHRs. As you follow the path of the doctor, would it may be the same for hospitalists, for example and for nurses. But on the clinical side, it's not that's not the case, it's not necessary. They follow a schedule patient schedule of fixed predetermined before the day starts. And so it's quite it's a very linear workflow. So it's a lot easier to develop the product, which we've done already for the clinical side of the house."", 'Ryan Daniels', ""Helpful. And then two more quick ones. And then just in regards to the premium go version, I think you referred to it as go assist. It was that a novel launch based on feedback you're getting from clinicians that they want to still involve a medical document specialist to make it even simpler for them to just review and sign off? Or is that something you're proactively putting in the market just to have kind of the broadest product offering of any vendor in this space?"", 'Manny Krakaris', ""Well, everything that we build is based on feedback we get from the market from our customers and prospective customers. So we had heard that ideally, everything that comes out of the backend is perfect or that doctors have an infinite amount of time to devote to medical documentation. That's not reality, hence. So there needs to be a solution to address is there no time constraints on the part of the doctor or limitations of the technology when it comes to more complex types of encounters and that led us to develop this particular product. It's a hybrid product where the flip of the switch, the clinician can choose to get some support to the extent they feel it's necessary Okay."", 'Ryan Daniels', ""Perfect. And then, Paul, maybe one for you and I'll hop off in regards to the gross margins. Appreciate the color on Q. one and some of the one-time items related to India for the full year. However, do you still think year over year gross margins will be able to expand? Or will this kind of transitory pushing q. one, keep them down year over year for the full year? Thanks."", 'Paul Ginocchio', ""I think on a year-on-year basis, they'll be up. Obviously, we'll exit the year and better than we will have it for in the first quarter. But overall I would expect some gross margin expansion."", 'Ryan Daniels', 'Okay, perfect. Thank you so much, guys. Congrats again.', 'Manny Krakaris', 'Thank you, Ryan.', 'Operator', 'Elizabeth Anderson, Evercore.', 'Elizabeth Anderson', ""Hi, guys. Thanks so much for the question and congrats on a nice quarter and outlook. I guess maybe just about of Ryan's question, just just the H2 rollout, maybe specific to the emergency department. Do you have any current indications from each year that sort of when they're expecting that to start rolling out or is that still sort of in flux at this point?"", 'Manny Krakaris', ""We have a general idea that they wanted to make it happen as soon as possible. And they have a formal process that they go through in terms of evaluation of the initial users and the data from their their from their use of the product. And they have certain criteria that they'd like us to achieve. And I think we're well on the way to meeting those those goals. So yes, my best guess is that it's going to happen very soon within within less than a month."", 'Elizabeth Anderson', ""Great set of indicators. And then just on your hiring, obviously, you've made a number of hires since the equity raise in the fall. How do you feel about where you are in terms of your $9 million of incremental investment. Do you have all the people in place addition of any key areas that you're still waiting to hire? Any more color on that would be helpful."", 'Manny Krakaris', ""Yes, we're well underway, but we're not we haven't completed the hires yet. So we have a very specific plan of who we're going to hire what physicians, what department, et cetera. And I'd say and Paul can chime in on this, we're probably about two thirds of the way through that hiring process by our CFO, and he's a 4Q 23 provider. It include any GO users. It does not come in historically. We've just we've include live and notes. We will factor that in as this year progresses there, Argo users, and we're still working to make sure that we conform to how we've done historically done it."", 'Elizabeth Anderson', ""Got it. And then terms of just talking about the GO assist version. How do we think about the sort of gross margins and maturity for that? It's sort of become between the sort of premium version? Should we still think of them being about 60%. It feels like the right way to think about that gross margin profile of those combined go and go versus direct."", 'Paul Ginocchio', ""Yes, I would we've stated that goal being north of 60% gross margin product. And we've said historically that Augmedix nose was 55 to 60. So right in that area with where go assist and hopefully over time as we scale, it gets better."", 'Elizabeth Anderson', 'Okay, perfect. Super helpful, guys. Thanks so much and congrats again.', 'Manny Krakaris', 'Thank you, Elizabeth.', 'Operator', '[Aaron Watts], Lake Street Capital Markets.', 'Aaron Watts', ""Hey, good afternoon, guys. This is analyzed for Brooks and congrats on the strong quarter. Bob, I guess, do you feel that the open platform partnerships of them materializing interior likeness and generating some impact to their customers? If you could just give us a sense as to what you've been seeing there that would be."", 'Manny Krakaris', ""So again, we haven't deployed anything yet. We're still developing the product. But if you recall, the impetus for doing this came from our customers in particular HCA. So we anticipate that HCA will be a source of demand for these particular products and they'll be on our platform. We will book the revenue, but we haven't completed the integration with it. For example, with the Sullivan group where it's underway, that work is underway, work is underway with Ellipsis at the behavioral health application. So those are underway. They will be deployed this year. But dumb FARES, there's no there's no response yet from the market because they haven't been deployed."", 'Aaron Watts', ""Okay, thanks. Thanks for that clarification. And then on I guess, as you start beginning the rollout go, do you expect any significant product mix shift? I guess just trends that you're expecting throughout the remainder of the year will be helpful as well, thank you."", 'Manny Krakaris', ""Well, you have to, I think, distinguish between users and revenue and from a user perspective, yes, I do expect there could be a shift in favor of GO as it grows faster than our other products, our legacy products from a revenue perspective because the RPU is so much lower for gold than it is for our legacy products. I don't think you'll see a similar, you know, realignment of the of the revenue mix in 24.Got it. Okay."", 'Aaron Watts', 'That is helpful. Thanks, guys. Well, thank you, everyone.', 'Operator', 'Allen Klee, Maxim Group.', 'Allen Klee', ""I'm so sorry about that. About the competitive environment. Can you discuss a little some there's been some companies that have gotten funding down for some of your comments on the a bunch of, you know, people doing AI models with it. Two things about that one. Once that kind of imply that license is going to be pricing pressure, we're the main players in the industry coming up and down along with that, like it, if somebody had a hearing choose if they have a doctor that chooses to go, are they displaced displacing one of your services like my for more of us, when do you think that would be placing some like a competitor?"", 'Elizabeth Anderson', ""Good question. So just broadly, in terms of the competitive landscape, yes, there have been several newcomers in this space, which is what we anticipated well over a year ago. All that does is basically reinforced the fact that our belief that this is a very large market, very attractive market and therefore, it's going to attract our competitors and venture capitalists who want to, you know, take advantage of that big opportunity. Having said that, the companies that you're describing that have announced large raises recently, one in particular, that's probably commanded.Most of the the airwaves has 65 employees. And so they what they still need to do is build the infrastructure that is necessary to support wide-scale deployment of their product. We've made that investment already. So we've got the infrastructure in place to deploy widely at scale and so we anticipate that these smaller companies, these newer companies are going to have to do the same thing that you have to make those investments in infrastructure to be able to scale from now the second part of your question, I could start refresh my memory issue.So disposition, yes. So in terms of cannibalization of products, we haven't seen that and we don't anticipate it primarily because it AC in particular, there's there's little live that's that's there to be displaced number one. And so it's mostly greenfield, a shale. I mean, vastly greenfield at HCA. So there's little opportunity for any kind of cannibalization, but more broadly across our all of our customers, we don't think so. We believe that go will cater to a distinct persona and price point in the market are quite different from the persona and price point of live customers. And we tested this this belief when we launched our newest product a couple of years ago and found that there was virtually no cannibalization of our live product. When we launched notes at a RPU that was less than half that of why does that answer your question, Alex?"", 'Allen Klee', ""Yes, thank you. One last question on your guidance where you said that the first quarter will be lower by 300 basis points some temporary costs related in Bangladesh, the cost initiatives in India phone. Could you explain a little what what what do you think the impact of these extra cost spectrum taking on I mean, it's built for some people that if you're really a technology company, why and why not that profitable? Seems like a lot and maybe you're less embellished with what you're doing is exemplary on. I don't know if it's could you just help us understand that?"", 'Paul Ginocchio', ""Sure. I'll use it as we stand today. Vast majority of our revenue still delivered by Augmenix live our legacy historical premium product. So that's still a human in the loop that we have a MDS that works with the clinician. So we we moved as we've grown we moved to a bigger office location in Dhaka in Bangladesh, and we are sunsetting the old building that we've been in since the 2018, maybe 2017. And so we've got a few months of duplicate costs there, rent transportation. So we'll come to the building up and running that for two buildings.We've also in India, sorry, in India, optimizing our service delivery to make sure we have the highest quality service at the best price. And so we're doing that and there's going to be about three months of overlap that will end in early May around that initiative. Those two things combined are basically the entire decline in gross margins quarter on quarter."", 'Allen Klee', 'Okay. Thank you very much.', 'Operator', '[Jan Z], B. Riley Securities.', ""Manny, congrats on the launch of GO, and it's great to hear that you can save up to ours for Dockers. So can you talk about some of the enhancements you recently added to go in the Anvil ambulatory setting and we have those it has then also added to the ER setting as well."", 'Manny Krakaris', ""Particularly cultures are facing a non-linear workflow in the emergency room setting, right? So we're always enhancing our products. We we've been releasing new features and enhancements to go almost on a weekly basis at this point. And so there are too many to recount now, but they're all designed to improve the user experience and to deliver greater utility to the health care enterprise. And you're right to point out that the products are designed differently between the clinical setting and the acute care setting for the emerging department you have a different section in the Medical Note that you had to create from scratch is called the NDSDM., which is essentially A.It's the medical decision making that's occurring in the emergency room. And that is not part of the standard note format for clinical outcome for the clinical visits. And so we had that we had to design that we had to get input from EHR data that comes in the form of labs and so forth. We had to be able to input those into the application and as close to real-time as possible so that the clinician knows at any given moment, the updated status of a patient so that they know when to return back to that patient to resume their their encounter in a version for it. So these are some of the things that we've been doing. We keep adding to the to the feature set for each product as we iterate and get feedback from our customers."", 'Paul Ginocchio', ""Maybe one of the maybe the biggest sort of enhancements we've made since we launched go or over the last six months is continuing to add additional specialties. As you heard me say, we've now service 50 specialties will continue to go deeper in a few key specialties, but we go now supports of sees over 50 specials where that's been a big enhancement over the last four or five months."", ""Right? And that just data and we ready reduce that like a little over a week ago. Got it. Yes, that's very helpful."", 'Manny Krakaris', ""Additional color there. And maybe one last one from me. Can you clarify the difference between go assist the premium version versus the nodes such as the level of involvement from medical documents specialist or a high contribution in terms of the the workflow and the utility, there's very little difference. However, notes will be sunset and it will be replaced by GO assist. And the reason for that is we want to provide our customers with a seamless experience, allowing them to transition from one to the other on demand as they needed. If you have two independent applications, there's it's more laborious to go from one app to another. So we wanted to eliminate that duality and just have it appeared in one seamless range of service that you get from one application."", ""Got it. Yes, that's all from us. Thank you."", 'Manny Krakaris', ""You're welcome."", 'Paul Ginocchio', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Allen Klee, Maxim Group.', 'Allen Klee', ""Yes, it's high for the for the $9 million of incremental loans pending from the capital raise them. So is it fair to assume that it's going to take longer to deploy it all in hiring and different things, so that should grow kind of incrementally as we go throughout the year rather than straight line?"", 'Paul Ginocchio', ""Yes, yes, I found one. We have done a really good job. The team has done a great job of we as soon as we made the decision to raise capital, we started starting opening some hiring process. So we were able to get a little bit of adamant that obviously not start until we actually had raised the capital. The team's done a great job of hitting hitting the goals. Obviously, we're hiring quite a few people. So but I think we're, as Manny said, we're two thirds of that. Hiring is already complete with more people coming on. We had some approvals today. We have done some projects here in the first quarter. So I'd say we're fully it's going to be fully reflected here in the in the second quarter with a lot of it reflected in the first."", 'Allen Klee', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Bill Sutherland, The Benchmark Company.', 'Bill Sutherland', ""It's usually Hey, guys been a very I just have I've a product question. I haven't heard about Augmenix perhaps in awhile. I did note that became a significant product for you guys."", 'Manny Krakaris', ""Yes. So a good question, Phil. We actually just signed an order for more prep at one of our biggest customers. So it seems to be getting some traction. It's still a fraction of our revenues relative to our other products, but it's there it does fill a need and we will continue to make it available to the market. And I suspect that the demand for it will expand as people become more aware of it. Okay. Well, timed question. I think."", 'Bill Sutherland', ""And then on your partnership with Google, maybe update us in terms of the components of that, you know, what, what's perhaps base on the original partnership, how that's what's what's the most important aspects of it as that's developed for you guys and what you kind of hold on your expectations going forward?"", 'Manny Krakaris', ""Thanks for a good question, David and the partnership is really predicated on two principle thrusts. One is technology. So we utilize Google technology in our platform. And the second thrust is go-to-market. So Google Cloud is our biggest most important channel partner, if you will. And dumb, we've had some very obviously HBA's the biggest success, but we've had other successes with through Google Cloud, and we are actively pursuing some significant opportunities again through that relationship. It's a fantastic. It's been a fantastic partnership, and we don't we see more of that.

In fact, we have some and there's a whole process. You have to go administrative process you have to go through to enable that. And we've already done that with Paul, correct me if I'm wrong, HCA. I think that's public and we're working on doing that with another health system as well. So and that's going to be a standard part of that of that go-to-market strategy."", 'Bill Sutherland', ""It's got it. Great workers.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend aristocrats and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 10 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats To Buy According to Analysts.\xa0', 'Investors often grapple with the decision of whether to invest in growth stocks or value stocks. While both strategies aim to enhance value for investors, they follow distinct paths. The primary distinction lies in the pricing. Growth stocks tend to be pricier, with high valuations relative to their sales or earnings. Conversely, value stocks are more affordable, with lower stock prices in comparison to their sales or earnings. Over time, both growth and value investment approaches have demonstrated comparable performance, yet historical analysis indicates that value investing has been more advantageous for investors in the long term. According to research published by Josef Lakonishok, Andrei Shleifer, and Robert W. Vishny in the Journal of Finance, value strategies tend to yield superior returns. Various investment strategies centered around purchasing undervalued stocks have consistently outperformed those focused on trendy or high-flying stocks from April 1968 to April 1990.', 'The research paper also emphasized that value stocks typically offer significantly higher dividend yields and possess stronger fundamental ratios compared to growth stocks. Both Josef Lakonishok and the value investing expert David Dreman have observed that value investing outperforms growth investing approximately 70% of the time, regardless of the size of the companies involved. Their studies, which encompassed various company sizes, revealed that value stocks consistently delivered average returns of slightly over 7% per year higher than growth stocks over extended periods.', 'As mentioned earlier, dividends are often a key component of value stocks. Among dividend strategies, one of the most popular approaches is investing in dividend aristocrats. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index tracks the performance of companies within the S&P 500 that have consistently increased their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. A report from S&P Dow Jones Indices indicated that strategies focusing on generating income often exhibit significant value characteristics. Investors typically gravitate towards securities offering high dividend yields and lower price multiples. The report also mentioned that the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index demonstrated a blend of both growth and value traits, rather than a pronounced bias towards one style. Analysis of the index composition from 1999 to 2022 revealed its style breakdown. On average, the index maintained a 59.04% exposure to value stocks and a 40.94% exposure to growth stocks during this period.', 'Despite the allure of high-priced growth stocks, value stocks have consistently proven to be advantageous for investors over the long haul. Dimensional Funds conducted an analysis spanning nearly a century, affirming that value stocks typically offer higher expected returns. While there have been occasional downturns, the fundamental principle that lower relative prices correlate with higher expected returns remains steadfast. Value premiums have often manifested swiftly and significantly. For instance, in years when value outperformed growth, the average premium amounted to nearly 15%. On average, in the US, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks by 4.4% annually from 1927 to 2022.', ""Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Emerson Electric Co.

In fact, the structure at Welchau is so large you can actually see it from space.', 'This wasn’t a blind drill by MCF Energy.', 'The explorer was taking cue from a historical discovery nearby. MCF’s Welchau well is just five kilometers north of the Molln-1 well, which was drilled in the 1980s, with a gas column of at least 400 meters and tested condensate-rich, pipeline-quality gas at a maximum flow rate of 3.5 million mmcfpd. Welchau is targeting the same reservoirs as the Molln-1 well.', 'Last year, MCF Energy (TSXV:MCF;\xa0OTC:MCFNF)\xa0CEO James Hill said in a press release that\xa0“A successful outcome at Welchau could be a significant catalyst for MCF Energy given the size of the Welchau anticline.""', 'That’s the point the junior explorer has now reached, and the timing is significant.', 'Back in the ‘80s when the Molln-1 discovery was made, gas wasn’t worth extracting in Europe. Prices were low and cheap Russian gas ruled the day. Since then, supermajors have refocused their sites on offshore, deep-water bonanzas, and Western Europe’s domestic gas sources were largely abandoned.', 'Fast forward to 2022 and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine that led to broad Western sanctions squeezing all of Moscow’s gas out of Europe, and we have the perfect setup for a return of drillers to Western Europe.', 'Now it’s time to get down to business on this fast-paced play.', 'Testing will soon be underway at Welchau-1, which was drilled to a total depth of 1,733.1 meters.\xa0“Above the primary target, drilling encountered a 380-metre section of the Lunz Formation, which has effectively trapped gas and condensate. This formation served as an essential seal, with results from this well successfully mitigating initial concerns about its quality and thickness,” MCF said in a March 18 press release.', 'The primary target was the Steinalm Formation, at a depth of 1,452 meters, in the same zone which flowed gas and condensate from the Molln-1 well, with the company noting that “the compositional analysis of the gas shows at Welchau closely matches the condensate-rich gas previously tested in the Molln-1 well”.', 'MCF extracted a continuous core of approximately 7 meters from the formation between 1,511 and 1,519 meters to analyze rock characteristics, which will enhance gas production, completion and performance. The visible ends of the cut core sections revealed a highly fractured carbonate structure, the company said.

It carefully assembled a portfolio of exploration and development assets when few others were paying attention."", 'The Genexco acquisition gave MCF Energy (TSXV:MCF;\xa0OTC:MCFNF)\xa0four key assets that include previously drilled wells and two discoveries, including its next drill, the Bavarian Lech East, and West Lech prospects, where they will re-enter the Kinsau #1 well targeting the productive reservoirs found by that well.', 'Back in 1983, this same well, Kinsau #1\xa0 tested at a maximum flow rate of 24 MMCFD. MCF’s 20% interest in this concession (through its Genexco acquisition) is carried, which means it won’t be paying for the cost of drilling, which the Company estimates to be up to 5 million euros.', 'The Kinsau #1 well, originally drilled by Mobil in the ‘80s, encountered a primary gas reservoir with associated condensate. But again, gas wasn’t economic back then.', 'The company is now preparing for an ambitious 4.6-million-euro exploration program for West Lech (10 sq kilometers) and East Lech (100 sq kilometers), for which it has 120 square kilometers of 3D and the latest in AI exploration software and machine learning that gives them a huge window onto where to drill.', 'MCF has spent a significant amount of time analyzing the cores from these wells, and Hill isn’t just eyeing recoverable gas with associated condensates; he’s also eyeing an oil zone, noting that in the ‘80s, using only a vertical well, as the technology of the day afforded, the Kinsau #2\xa0 well produced almost 200 bpd. MCF is studying going back in and recreating this with a horizontal well to stimulate a zone that they know contains hydrocarbons already.\xa0 Horizontal wells produce at much higher rates than vertical wells and more effectively drain the reserves.', 'MCF is also gearing up to drill another German prospect--Reudnitz, a proven, large-scale natural gas development that also contains an oil exploration target, as well as\xa0the\xa0Erlenwiese concession in the Rhein Graben which covers about 80 square kilometers.', 'Reudnitz, some 70 km southeast of Berlin, was initially discovered in 1964 with multi-zone hydrocarbon potential and proven phases of Helium (~0.2%), methane (14-20%), and like most fields in northern Germany high nitrogen content (>80%).\xa0 According to the company, pilot test production should start this year.

Natural gas is the obvious bridge fuel. Renewables alone are not up to capacity, which Europe learned when Russia invaded Ukraine and Western sanctions sent the continent’s energy supply into a state of crisis.', 'The fallout from that crisis had cost the European Union an estimated $1 trillion as of December 2022, according to\xa0Bloomberg.', 'The only medium-term answer for Europe is domestic natural gas, with the gaps filled in with LNG.', 'Europe’s under-investment in natural gas has been laid bare, and now we are in the middle of a historical energy reset, with trillions of dollars up for grabs.

The first is maintaining the total debt/Ebitda ratio above 6 despite the company's improving operating income margin in recent quarters. Also, in 2024, there will be a U.S. presidential election and, as a result, some politicians may begin to speak out for stronger regulation of the pharmaceutical industry, including efforts to reduce drug prices."", ""However, despite these risks, management's business strategies are beginning to bear fruit, which is reflected in the improvement of its gross and operating income margins in recent quarters. As a result, the company has continued to increase its dividend payments over the past 22 years, which is an important factor that attracts long-term investors. Also, thanks to the acquisition of HRA Pharma, Perrigo significantly expanded its product range, allowing it to become one of the leaders in the global over-the-counter medicine market."", ""We initiate our coverage of Perrigo's with an outperform rating for the next 12 months."", 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

On Friday, the stock prices of Valero Energy VLO, Marathon Petroleum MPC and Phillips 66 PSX climbed to their all-time highs of $166.10, $195.12 and $159.74, respectively. On the day, each of them saw their share price increase about 3%. This jump marks a year-to-date ascent of somewhere between 20% and 30% for the operators.', ""Obviously, the recent rise in oil prices has played a key role in the abovementioned companies' surge. That's a big boon for VLO, MPC and PSX, given that it drives prices at the pumps.During the past week, crude oil surged to its highest levels in four months, surpassing $81 per barrel. This upward momentum was driven by significant decreases in U.S. crude and gasoline inventories, along with an optimistic demand projection from the International Energy Agency (“IEA”). Additionally, ongoing production cuts by OPEC and its allies, coupled with drone attacks on Russian energy facilities in Ukraine, bolstered crude prices.The IEA revised its forecast for oil demand growth upward for the current year and predicted a slight supply deficit through 2024, contrary to earlier expectations of a surplus. In its monthly report, the IEA raised its estimate for crude oil demand growth in 2024 by 110,000 barrels per day (bbl/day) to 1.3 million bbl/day, citing a stronger outlook for the U.S. market and increased fuel demand in shipping due to longer routes taken to avoid Red Sea conflicts. The agency also lowered its supply forecast for non-OPEC countries.Escalating attacks on Russian energy infrastructure and persistent uncertainty surrounding the Israel-Palestine conflict were additional factors contributing to the uptick in oil prices. Furthermore, a positive development was the Energy Information Administration's (‘EIA’) report, which revealed the first decline in U.S. crude inventories in seven weeks, accompanied by a significant drop in gasoline inventories. Prior to this, oil prices had been rising following Saudi Arabia's agreement with OPEC+ partners earlier in the month to extend production cuts of around 2 million bbl/day until mid-year.The downstream operators also benefited from the surge in gasoline prices, as U.S. refiners completed planned maintenance activities. As a result, domestic refinery utilization rates remained below 87% for eight consecutive weeks, marking the longest period of such low utilization in three years."", 'Continuing the ascension of of Valero Energy, Marathon Petroleum and Phillips 66 shares were their favorable fourth-quarter results that widely surpassed the bottom-line expectations during the period.VLO’s Q4 earnings of $3.55 per share breezed past the Zacks Consensus of $2.95 a share by 20%. Similarly, MPC easily surpassed Q4 earnings expectations with EPS at $3.98 per share and 69% above estimates of $2.36 a share. Meanwhile, quarterly EPS of $3.09 topped estimates by 30%.VLO, MPC and PSX stocks are part of the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining & Marketing industry group, which ranks in the top 30% out of more than 250 Zacks Ranked Industries.

During this period, the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, which Amgen falls in, has lost 0.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?"", ""Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision."", 'Earnings Estimate Revisions', ""Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements."", 'For the current quarter, Amgen is expected to post earnings of $3.84 per share, indicating a change of -3.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.5% over the last 30 days.', 'The consensus earnings estimate of $19.48 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +4.5%. This estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.', 'For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $21.02 indicates a change of +7.9% from what Amgen is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.', ""Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.

It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial."", 'In the case of Amgen, the consensus sales estimate of $7.45 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +22%. The $32.91 billion and $34.09 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +16.8% and +3.6%, respectively.', 'Last Reported Results and Surprise History', 'Amgen reported revenues of $8.2 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +19.8%.

The EPS surprise was +1.07%.', 'The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.', 'Valuation', ""No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance."", ""Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is."", 'The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.', 'Amgen is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers.

If you want to skip our discussion on the gold industry, check out 5 Best Gold ETFs To Buy Now.\xa0', 'In late 2023, gold prices experienced a significant surge due to increased central bank buying and growing investor concerns over geopolitical tensions including the Israel–Hamas and Russia–Ukraine conflicts. This rally was further fueled by a weakening US dollar and expectations of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Gold prices reached a record high of $2,135.39 per ounce in December. After continuous interest rate hikes that brought the Federal Reserve funds rate to its highest level in over 22 years, policymakers have signaled plans for at least three rate cuts in 2024. Natasha Kaneva, Head of Global Commodities Strategy at J.P. Morgan, commented:\xa0', '“Commodities are unlikely to benefit from core inflation in 2024. Inflation should fall to under 3%, so that, along with properly timing the business cycle, are the two conditions needed to initiate long positions, making the outlook for the sector very tactical in 2024. Across commodities, for the second consecutive year, the only structural bullish call we hold is for gold and silver.”', 'Reflecting similar market sentiment, Gregory Shearer, Head of Base and Precious Metals Strategy at J.P. Morgan, stated:\xa0', '“Across all metals, we have the highest conviction on a bullish medium-term forecast for both gold and silver over the course of 2024 and into the first half of 2025, though timing an entry will continue to be critical. At the moment, gold still appears quite rich relative to underlying rates and foreign exchange (FX) fundamentals, and still looks vulnerable to another modest retreat in the near-term, as Fed rate cut expectations are now running earlier than our forecasts.”', ""In 2023, gold showcased strength despite expectations, outperforming multiple assets including commodities, bonds, and most stock markets. The World Gold Council highlighted that market consensus leans towards a 'soft landing' in the US, historically not favorable for gold returns, although geopolitical tensions and continued central bank buying may provide support. However, the possibility of the Fed achieving a soft landing with interest rates above 5% remains uncertain, with a global recession still possible, prompting investors to consider gold as an effective hedge. While the odds favor a soft landing, historical data shows it has been achieved only twice following nine tightening cycles, indicating potential challenges. The World Gold Council noted that the labor market's status is crucial in determining economic conditions, with potential shifts from a soft to a hard landing. Other possible scenarios include a 'no landing,' characterized by reaccelerated inflation and growth, which could initially challenge gold. Expected policy rate easing may not translate as favorably for gold due to factors like real interest rates and consumer demand constraints. A recession, if it occurs, historically benefits high-quality government bonds and gold, though initially, it might pose challenges for gold. However, if inflation surges, it could lead to a stronger monetary response, reinforcing the case for strategic gold allocations."", 'Goldman Sachs Research expects gold prices to rise due to increased central bank purchases and robust retail demand in emerging markets. Analysts Nicholas Snowdon and Lavinia Forcellese predict a potential 6% climb in gold prices over the next year to reach $2,175 per troy ounce. While uncertainties surrounding Federal Reserve interest rate policy may lead to short-term fluctuations, the downside risks to gold prices are expected to be limited. Strong central bank purchases, particularly from China and India, have offset outflows from gold exchange-traded funds, driven partly by geopolitical tensions such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the COVID pandemic. The recent decrease in ETF purchases is attributed to already high holdings and the influence of real interest rates. Speculative positioning by hedge funds seems more responsive to shifts in long-term yields than ETF holdings. Historically, changes in gold ETF holdings have correlated with major risk-off events and cycles of monetary policy easing. Analysts anticipate a potential increase in ETF holdings once the Fed begins cutting rates, possibly starting in May. Additionally, rising incomes in emerging markets are boosting consumer demand for gold, particularly in jewelry. According to Goldman Sachs analysts:\xa0', '“The rapidly growing cohort of ‘affluent’ consumers in India … will drive growth in jewelry consumption. Moreover, gold consumption has also been supported by a lack of alternative investments in some countries which saw big policy shifts (Turkey, China) in the past few years.”', 'Gold and silver are expected to see continued growth in 2024, as UBS forecasts, largely due to anticipated interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve. This expectation, coupled with a weaker dollar, is projected to push gold prices upwards, with forecasts suggesting a potential increase to $2,200 per ounce by year-end. Historically, gold tends to rise when interest rates decrease, as it becomes a more attractive investment compared to bonds in a low-rate environment. Additionally, lower interest rates typically lead to a depreciation of the dollar, making gold more affordable for international buyers, thereby boosting demand. Despite uncertainties surrounding the timing and extent of rate cuts, UBS maintains its forecast for Federal Reserve policy easing. The recent surge in gold\'s appeal as a safe haven asset, particularly amidst geopolitical tensions like Israel\'s conflict with Hamas, has also contributed to its record-breaking prices. Moreover, optimism extends to silver, often considered gold\'s ""poorer cousin,"" which is expected to perform well, especially in the event of Federal Reserve easing. While silver has historically underperformed gold, analysts believe it has significant catching up to do, potentially resulting in a dramatic surge.\xa0', 'Some of the best gold stocks to buy include Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD), and Franco-Nevada Corporation (NYSE:FNV).

With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. We'll use ROE to examine NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), by way of a worked example."", 'Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.', ' Check out our latest analysis for NextEra Energy ', 'ROE can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for NextEra Energy is:', '11% = US$6.3b ÷ US$59b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.11."", ""Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. You can see in the graphic below that NextEra Energy has an ROE that is fairly close to the average for the Electric Utilities industry (9.0%)."", ""That isn't amazing, but it is respectable. Even if the ROE is respectable when compared to the industry, its worth checking if the firm's ROE is being aided by high debt levels. If true, then it is more an indication of risk than the potential. To know the 3 risks we have identified for NextEra Energy visit our risks dashboard for free."", ""Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used."", 'NextEra Energy clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.24. The combination of a rather low ROE and significant use of debt is not particularly appealing. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.', ""Return on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE."", 'But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.', 'Of course NextEra Energy may not be the best stock to buy.

It witnessed a slight increase of 1.1% in 2023, up by 410 million tonnes from 2022 levels. The total CO2 emissions reached 37.4\xa0 billion tonnes in 2023. In 2022, the gain was 490 million tonnes from the previous year. Clean energy technologies such as solar panels, wind turbines, nuclear power, and electric vehicles have a huge role in the slowdown of emissions. The IEA estimated that green technologies prevented a massive surge in carbon dioxide emissions. Without clean technologies, the emissions would have been 3 times higher than they were in the past five years. More than 40% of the carbon emissions from energy were a result of droughts in China, India, the US, and countries and territories that cut hydroelectric output and used conventional energy sources for utilities. Energy-related carbon emissions increased in China and India in 2023. However, advanced economies witnessed a record decline as their economies grew. The emissions in these economies declined to a 50-year low. This decline was driven by the drop in coal demand to levels not witnessed since the early 1900s. Energy carbon emissions declined by 4.1% in the US, driven by the bulk reduction of emissions from the electricity sector. You can also take a look at some of the top countries with the most carbon dioxide emissions per capita.', 'On December 2, Reuters reported that many governments launched new initiatives to strengthen clean energy and cut down GHG emissions at the 28th Conference of Parties on Climate Change (COP 28). 118 governments committed to triple the global renewable energy capacity by 2030 at the conference, as a step toward cutting down fossil fuel share in global energy production to cut down emissions.', ""Some of the major companies working on clean energy systems include NextEra Energy, Inc.

""Introducing implied volatility indices such as the S&P/B3 Ibovespa VIX index reflects the liquid ecosystem of products in Brazil and is additive to S&P DJI\'s market-leading indices offering.""', '""The new index adds to B3\'s product portfolio a volatility indicator that can be used by financial professionals as a reference to measure risk perception. The options market in Brazil has reached a new level in terms of traded volume, which has allowed the launch of this index and made it possible to bring to the local market a methodology that is already well established in other parts of the world,"" said Henio Scheidt, Manager of Indices at B3.', ""S&P DJI and Cboe have licensed the use of the VIX Index methodology to several exchanges and index firms around the world.

Developed based on the VIX Index methodology, the S&P/B3 Ibovespa VIX index similarly uses options prices rather than stock prices in its calculation because options prices reflect the buyers and sellers' expectations of volatility on the Ibovespa B3. While the S&P/B3 Ibovespa VIX index is not a tradeable product, the benchmark index is designed to provide visibility into market sentiment that can aid market participants' understanding of the level of perceived risk and a 30-day view of the potential range of Ibovespa B3 returns."", 'For more information about S&P Dow Jones Indices, please visit https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/.', 'ABOUT S&P DOW JONES INDICES', 'S&P Dow Jones Indices is the largest global resource for essential index-based concepts, data and research, and home to iconic financial market indicators, such as the S&P 500® and the Dow Jones Industrial Average®.

The company's share price closed out the daily session down 6.4% according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Notably, the pullback happened even as the S&P 500 index climbed roughly 0.8%."", ""Supermicro stock was added to the S&P 500 today, replacing Whirlpool in the benchmark index. The move was announced on March 4, and the server specialist's stock posted explosive gains on the news. Even with today's pullback, Supermicro's share price is still up roughly 11% since it was announced that the company was being added to the index."", ""Being included in the S&P 500 index is often a bullish sign for a stock. Once a company becomes part of the S&P 500, investors who purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the index will also effectively be buying shares of that company's stock. In turn, that tends to increase demand and send its share price higher. Being part of the S&P 500 is also a prestigious distinction, and it can bolster the appeal of a still relatively little-known company, such as Supermicro."", ""But in this case, it looks like some investors got overly excited about the short-term pricing impact that actually being added to the index would have. While the stock had actually been up as much as 7.4% early in the day's trading, many shareholders moved to take profits shortly after the market opened."", ""Even with today's sell-off, Supermicro has been one of this year's best performing artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. The company's share price has rocketed roughly 252% higher across 2024's trading thanks to AI-driven demand for its high-performance rack servers."", ""Supermicro stock is now trading at roughly 46 times this year's expected earnings and a bit under 33.5 times next year's expected profits. Meanwhile, the company has a forward price-to-earnings growth (PEG) ratio of roughly 0.5 and a one-year forward PEG of roughly 0.6. Typically, a PEG of less than one is viewed as an indication that a stock is undervalued."", ""Based on the company's recent sales and earnings growth and the emergence of AI-related tailwinds, it's not unreasonable to think that Supermicro stock can still deliver big wins over the long term. But investors should approach the stock with the understanding that near-term performance could be bumpy on the heels of such explosive growth. With that in mind, taking a dollar-cost-averaging approach to the stock looks like a sensible strategy for bulls right now."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

The energy transition, all the M&A that's been going on, AI, of course. I'm here with this CEO of the host of the conference, S&P Global, Douglas Peterson is here with me."", ""DOUGLAS PETERSON: Great, Julie, thanks for being here. But especially thanks for being here for CERAWeek. You're going to have a fantastic opportunity."", 'JULIE HYMAN: I am very--', 'DOUGLAS PETERSON: --so many people.', ""JULIE HYMAN: So talk to us about what you see as some of the big themes of the conference, and what you're most excited to hear about as you're here."", ""DOUGLAS PETERSON: You mentioned oil and gas, and traditionally, this was an oil and gas conference. It goes back over 40 years. But over the last few years, it's transitioned into a conference about energy transition."", 'And the themes are, some people are going to talk about molecules, about hydrogen and how things are changing. Energy transition. But this is a real conference about revolution, about innovation, and how the energy landscape is going to look many, many years going forward.', ""JULIE HYMAN: Now, you guys help measure how that is all working, right. You have different scores for companies, you're a data company, and there was a new rule that was proposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission to try to improve transparency and reporting-- some new reporting requirements put on companies having to do with climate."", ""A court, actually, just paused the implementation of that rule on Friday. But I'm curious what your view is. Do you think that it's a good idea and is it helpful?"", ""DOUGLAS PETERSON: I think it's a really good idea to have consistent standards and, first of all, when we say, globally. There's an organization called the International Sustainability Standards Board, the ISSB, that is looking at ways to have consistent standards for disclosure about climate action around the globe, and the US needs to get on board. And the US, actually, is a member of the ISSB, which comes from the IFRS."", ""So I was encouraged that the rule that came out was one where both the environmentalists and some of the others were against it, means that maybe they're starting to hit the right balance on it. But we need to have something that allows us to have disclosure."", 'By the way, about 85% of the companies in the S&P 500 are disclosing climate disclosure today. They have it in a report. Might be called a climate report or an impact report or something like that. So this is going to allow to have consistency, transparency, comparability, which would all be great for the markets.', ""JULIE HYMAN: And when you look at the energy industry in particular, and I know S&P gives ESG scores to every company, a lot of the companies here are talking about the energy transition and what they're doing. Are they actually doing it? How far along are we?"", ""DOUGLAS PETERSON: Well, this is something, why we're here for this conference, to understand that. And one of the things that we're measuring is a company's ability to meet their transition promises. Many companies has put out a 20, 30, a 20, 40, a 20, 50 target, and we want to see, are they going to have the ability to meet those targets? And that's going to be one of the discussions here in this conference."", 'JULIE HYMAN: How helpful has the IRA been in terms of helping spur changes there, helping spur money flowing into some of these new technologies also?', ""DOUGLAS PETERSON: Well, the IRA is bringing a level of infrastructure investment that we hadn't seen in the United States for a long time, and it's going to allow this concentrated investment go into energy transition. And it's some of the areas that are difficult to get to, batteries, new types of metals that are needed, hydrogen."", ""Hydrogen is something that's going to have an opportunity, and especially in the Southwest, this area of the country, because of the sun. Because of the energy that's here."", 'And so the IRA is bringing a massive amount of investment from around the globe. Things like batteries for different types of energy sources. So the IRA is a really important initiative in the US.', ""JULIE HYMAN: How important is this election for the energy transition? And are we seeing an outcome where it's going to look very different, depending on who wins the presidency?"", ""DOUGLAS PETERSON: I don't think it will look that different. Well, first of all, there's over 4 million people around-- 4 billion people voting around the world this year. There's elections going on all the time. I don't think that it's going to have that big of an impact on the energy transition story."", ""I believe that the IRA will be here to stay. I don't see any reason why that would change, no matter what the outcome of the election. But energy transition and climate is on every single person's mind. I can't have a meeting where we don't talk about it."", ""You mentioned AI, at the very beginning, that's another one of the themes, interest rates, there's a few themes that every meeting I go to, we talk about those. But energy transition is on everybody's minds. People are starting to build energy transition plans. That's not going to change because of the election."", 'JULIE HYMAN: But are your clients asking you for advice on how to prepare for, specifically here in the US, each eventuality?', ""DOUGLAS PETERSON: We're not consultants so we're not giving advice, we're providing transparent consistent data so people can make informed decisions. But in maybe more informal conversations, we talk a lot about the elections and what some of the different impacts could be."", ""But I really don't think in the energy business, that the election will have that big of an impact because companies are already moving and they're moving fast."", ""JULIE HYMAN: And then finally, just quickly, on AI, I know you participated in a panel on this very topic. What's the biggest change that AI is bringing to energy? Because it's not necessarily something that people think of right away when they think about AI, is the energy industry."", 'DOUGLAS PETERSON: Yeah. The AI is going to bring an opportunity to completely rethink the way you use data. And the way you can project forward how different technologies are going to be used for the energy transition.', ""In addition, it's going to be very valuable for the part that's difficult for any transition, is the financial impact. There is trillions of dollars needed to invest and finance the energy transition. s AI is going to also help with that to find the most promising investments, the most promising approaches to energy."", ""But I think when you go to this molecule approach that some people are talking about, you'll also be able to apply AI to some of that kind of study as well. But big compute, AI are going to be advantage going forward as well for the energy transition.""]"

There's no telling how deep Boeing's problems run."", ""Instead, consider a proven winner like Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT). It's a more diversified defense and aerospace company than Boeing, poised to deliver solid long-term investment returns."", 'Here is what you need to know.', ""Aviation is a significant component of Lockheed Martin's business, but the company is diversified across air, land, sea, and space.

The dividend payout ratio is 49% of cash flow, leaving roughly $3 billion in cash flow after paying the dividend that management can repurchase shares with.

Shares of the aerospace and defense giant known for its F-35 fighter jet, the C-130 Hercules transport aircraft, the HIMARS, and other state-of-the-art weapons systems are likely to benefit notably upon an inclusion in the prestigious Dividend Aristocrats Index. I believe this is going to be a positive catalyst for the stock’s investment case, adding to my bullish view of the stock.', 'A Dividend Aristocrat is a term used to refer to a select group of S&P 500 companies that have hiked their dividends consistently year after year for at least 25 consecutive years. Besides this condition, the three other formal requirements for a company to be included in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index are the following:', 'Being a member of the S&P 500 Index', 'Maintaining a float-adjusted market cap of at least $3 billion', 'Maintaining $5 million in daily share trading value for three months before acceptance.', 'Lockheed Martin easily meets these three criteria. Thus, with a track record of 21 consecutive years of dividend increases already in place, assuming the company maintains its current trajectory, Lockheed Martin is poised to fulfill the final condition for inclusion in the esteemed Dividend Aristocrats Index in approximately the next four years.', 'Becoming a Dividend Aristocrat isn’t just about status. A company’s inclusion in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index comes with several benefits, so it’s a relatively big deal.', 'For starters, yes, status is one of the benefits that will benefit Lockheed Martin stock upon future inclusion in the Index. Currently, only 68 companies boast the Dividend Aristocrat title. Precisely because this group of companies is so elite, its constituents tend to hold a strong standing within the investment community.', 'Investors appreciate the proven ability of the management teams in these companies to reward them with growing dividends over prolonged periods, including during recessions and challenging market climates. In turn, this leads to Dividend Aristocrat stocks featuring below-average volatility. Evidently, the Dividend Aristocrats Index ETF (BATS:NOBL) currently features a beta of 0.75, lower than the core S&P 500 ETFs’ beta, which is, by definition, 1.00.', 'Another benefit of being a Dividend Aristocrat is that a stock’s valuation can achieve above-average levels as investors are willing to pay a premium for high-quality names. Thus, while future investors may have to slightly overpay for Lockheed Martin, assuming this premise takes place, investors securing exposure to the stock in advance could end up benefiting from additional gains just from this factor alone.', 'Finally, I believe that Lockheed Martin could enjoy lower borrowing costs upon inclusion in the index due to its debtors will be reminded of the company’s credibility and overall ability to produce growing profits. Given that Lockheed utilizes debt rather heavily due to the CapEx-heavy nature of its business, evidenced by its current net debt position of $17.2 billion, a reduction in borrowing costs could have a significant effect on improving its profitability.', 'One potential concern that investors might have regarding Lockheed’s journey to becoming a Dividend Aristocrat could be the fact that its dividend growth has decelerated in recent years. Particularly, the rate of Lockheed’s past five dividend increases is as follows:', '2019 dividend increase: 9.1%', '2020 dividend increase: 8.3%', '2021 dividend increase: 7.7%', '2022 dividend increase: 7.1%', '2023 dividend increase: 5.0%', 'Despite the declining pace of dividend growth, I don’t think that this should be a concern for investors. I believe that this is a temporary trend formed by management essentially preparing for the possibility of a rising rate environment in advance, which ultimately ensued. Thus, I see the dividend growth deceleration as a prudent move and not a lack of earnings capacity to pursue stronger increases.

While both strategies aim to enhance value for investors, they follow distinct paths. The primary distinction lies in the pricing. Growth stocks tend to be pricier, with high valuations relative to their sales or earnings. Conversely, value stocks are more affordable, with lower stock prices in comparison to their sales or earnings. Over time, both growth and value investment approaches have demonstrated comparable performance, yet historical analysis indicates that value investing has been more advantageous for investors in the long term. According to research published by Josef Lakonishok, Andrei Shleifer, and Robert W. Vishny in the Journal of Finance, value strategies tend to yield superior returns. Various investment strategies centered around purchasing undervalued stocks have consistently outperformed those focused on trendy or high-flying stocks from April 1968 to April 1990.', 'The research paper also emphasized that value stocks typically offer significantly higher dividend yields and possess stronger fundamental ratios compared to growth stocks. Both Josef Lakonishok and the value investing expert David Dreman have observed that value investing outperforms growth investing approximately 70% of the time, regardless of the size of the companies involved. Their studies, which encompassed various company sizes, revealed that value stocks consistently delivered average returns of slightly over 7% per year higher than growth stocks over extended periods.', 'As mentioned earlier, dividends are often a key component of value stocks. Among dividend strategies, one of the most popular approaches is investing in dividend aristocrats. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index tracks the performance of companies within the S&P 500 that have consistently increased their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. A report from S&P Dow Jones Indices indicated that strategies focusing on generating income often exhibit significant value characteristics. Investors typically gravitate towards securities offering high dividend yields and lower price multiples. The report also mentioned that the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index demonstrated a blend of both growth and value traits, rather than a pronounced bias towards one style. Analysis of the index composition from 1999 to 2022 revealed its style breakdown. On average, the index maintained a 59.04% exposure to value stocks and a 40.94% exposure to growth stocks during this period.', 'Despite the allure of high-priced growth stocks, value stocks have consistently proven to be advantageous for investors over the long haul. Dimensional Funds conducted an analysis spanning nearly a century, affirming that value stocks typically offer higher expected returns. While there have been occasional downturns, the fundamental principle that lower relative prices correlate with higher expected returns remains steadfast. Value premiums have often manifested swiftly and significantly. For instance, in years when value outperformed growth, the average premium amounted to nearly 15%. On average, in the US, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks by 4.4% annually from 1927 to 2022.', ""Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Emerson Electric Co.

If you want to skip our discussion on dividend-paying companies, head over to 5 Best Dividend ETFs To Buy.\xa0', 'Reuters reported that global corporate dividends reached a record high of $1.66 trillion in 2023, largely due to substantial contributions from banks. According to the Janus Henderson Global Dividend Index, nearly 86% of listed companies worldwide either increased or maintained their dividends. Projections from the same index indicate that dividend payouts are set to hit a new peak of $1.72 trillion this year. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) emerged as the leading dividend payer in 2023, followed closely by Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM). The overall value of corporate dividends saw a 5% increase from 2022 to 2023, totaling $1.57 trillion. Ben Lofthouse, head of global equity income at Janus Henderson, attributed this growth to robust corporate cash flow, driving dividends and share buybacks.\xa0', 'Moreover, high interest rates boosted bank margins, resulting in a record $220 billion payout to shareholders in 2023. However, this positive trend was counteracted by significant dividend cuts in the mining sector, primarily due to lower commodity prices. Although the rapid ascent of bank dividends may decelerate, declines in the mining sector are expected to have a reduced impact. Despite challenges in specific sectors, diverse industries such as vehicles, utilities, software, food, and engineering demonstrated promising growth. Geographically, Europe (excluding the UK) and Japan played pivotal roles in global dividend growth, with Europe witnessing a 10.4% increase in payouts. The United States, while making a substantial contribution to global dividend growth owing to its size, reported a growth rate in line with the global average at 5.1%. Conversely, emerging markets observed stagnant dividends, with Brazil facing substantial cuts and China experiencing lackluster growth.', ""The Federal Reserve responded to the rise in inflation, spurred by monetary easing during the COVID-19 pandemic, by steadily increasing interest rates throughout 2023. This move had significant ramifications, leading to heightened borrowing costs for companies amid escalating interest rates and inflationary pressures. S&P Global Market Intelligence reported that there was a notable 59% increase in the number of companies filing for bankruptcy in 2023, compared to the previous year, nearing levels observed during the pandemic's peak. However, the anticipated growth in regular dividends in the US market averages around 5.8%, aligning with the 10-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.7% since 2014. The energy sector leads variable dividends, driven by a shift towards performance-based shareholder return policies since 2019. In 2022, over 20 energy companies disbursed a record $20 billion in variable dividends, benefiting from elevated oil and gas prices. However, in 2023, companies favored share repurchases due to lower valuation. The size of variable dividends in 2024 will hinge on oil and gas price volatility, demand, and its impact on share prices. The five largest sectors collectively contribute nearly 40% of total dividends and 2.05% in the estimated 5.8% growth, with real estate mandated to distribute the majority of its earnings."", ""Lately, investors are showing renewed interest in dividend-paying stocks this year after a period of decline in 2023, despite robust returns in the US stock market. Last year, rising interest rates led investors to favor bonds over stocks with smaller payouts, while mega-cap tech stocks attracted attention due to artificial intelligence hype. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index saw a modest 5.7% increase compared to the broader S&P 500 total return index's 26% gain. However, with recent declines in yields and the possibility of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, dividend stocks are gaining traction again. Analysts suggest that investors are seeking stable, higher-yielding dividends amidst ongoing market volatility, particularly during an easing cycle. Companies that raise their dividends often receive favorable attention from investors, as evidenced by recent examples such as Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN) and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), whose stock prices increased following dividend hikes and share buyback announcements. Historical data indicates that companies increasing dividends tend to outperform in the stock market, while those lowering dividends may face underperformance."", 'Some of the best dividend stocks to buy include Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), JPMorgan Chase & Co.

The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. In other words, investors can purchase Medtronic's shares before the 21st of March in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 12th of April."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.69 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$2.76 to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Medtronic has a trailing yield of 3.3% on the current share price of US$83.57.

As a result, readers should always check whether Medtronic has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut."", ' View our latest analysis for Medtronic ', ""Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. It paid out 87% of its earnings as dividends last year, which is not unreasonable, but limits reinvestment in the business and leaves the dividend vulnerable to a business downturn. We'd be concerned if earnings began to decline. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Over the last year it paid out 74% of its free cash flow as dividends, within the usual range for most companies."", ""It's positive to see that Medtronic's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. This is why it's a relief to see Medtronic earnings per share are up 6.7% per annum over the last five years. Decent historical earnings per share growth suggests Medtronic has been effectively growing value for shareholders. However, it's now paying out more than half its earnings as dividends. If management lifts the payout ratio further, we'd take this as a tacit signal that the company's growth prospects are slowing."", ""Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the past 10 years, Medtronic has increased its dividend at approximately 9.4% a year on average. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders."", ""From a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Medtronic? Earnings per share have been growing modestly and Medtronic paid out a bit over half of its earnings and free cash flow last year. Overall, it's not a bad combination, but we feel that there are likely more attractive dividend prospects out there."", 'Curious what other investors think of Medtronic?

Boeing is one of only a few companies that build commercial jets, so it's hard to see the company vanishing. It could be too big to fail. However, that doesn't mean you should buy the stock. There's no telling how deep Boeing's problems run."", ""Instead, consider a proven winner like Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT). It's a more diversified defense and aerospace company than Boeing, poised to deliver solid long-term investment returns."", 'Here is what you need to know.', ""Aviation is a significant component of Lockheed Martin's business, but the company is diversified across air, land, sea, and space. Lockheed Martin designs and manufactures complex weapons systems, vehicles, and technologies for the U.S. government and its allies. Some of Lockheed Martin's famous programs include the F-35 fighter jet, Black Hawk helicopters, the Javelin weapon system, Air Warfare Destroyer ships, and more."", ""The company's trailing 12-month revenue is $67 billion, and Lockheed Martin ended 2023 with a record-high $160.6 billion order backlog. Unfortunately for the world, the ongoing geopolitical conflicts, including in Gaza and Ukraine, only increase the likely demand for defense and weapons products like what Lockheed Martin builds."", ""Lockheed Martin has existed since the early 1900s, and that's generations of relationship building with the U.S. government, the best customer a company could hope to have. It's doubtful that Lockheed Martin is going anywhere anytime soon."", 'Importantly, Lockheed Martin is profitable enough to share its profits with investors. It repurchases its shares to help boost earnings-per-share growth and pays dividends that management has raised for 22 consecutive years.', 'This dramatically boosts investment returns over time. For example, a $10,000 investment in Lockheed Martin 20 years ago would be worth $99,000 today on price appreciation alone. Add in the dividends, and that investment balloons to over $173,000:', 'The share repurchases add up too. The outstanding share count has declined by nearly 24% over the past decade alone.', ""Fortunately, Lockheed Martin seems poised to continue this successful recipe for returns. The dividend payout ratio is 49% of cash flow, leaving roughly $3 billion in cash flow after paying the dividend that management can repurchase shares with. Lockheed Martin is also leveraged to just 1.6 times its EBITDA, so the balance sheet is in great shape and doesn't need to be immediately addressed. That means more cash for investors."", ""The biggest drawback to Lockheed Martin today is the company's struggle to grow revenue. Sales have stagnated over the past few years, and there is a lot of political pressure to keep federal spending under control."", ""Fortunately, management is guiding 2024 revenue between $68.5B and $70B, so Lockheed Martin looks ready to resume revenue growth. However, analysts believe the company's earnings will grow by just mid-single digits annually over the coming years."", ""These estimates could prove conservative. For starters, America's defense budget continues to grow. According to Statista, experts believe it will grow from around $850 billion to over $1 trillion over the next decade. There is also the uncertainty of U.S. politics. Elections could change the outlook for defense and aerospace companies like Lockheed Martin."", ""Investors should note that management is guiding for a slight earnings decline in 2024, but the long-term trend seems to be upward. It's just a matter of how fast earnings will grow."", ""Still, it's hard to go wrong here if you're a long-term investor looking for a slow and steady wealth-creating stock you can buy and sleep well at night."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Lockheed Martin right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Lockheed Martin, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Lockheed Martin wasn’t one of them.

Bustamante enriches the diversity of genomic datasets and brings precision medicine to underserved populations', 'Originally published on Illumina News Center', 'In the early days of the pandemic, personal and professional aspects of Carlos D. Bustamante\'s life were converging. His daughter had just fallen ill with a post-infectious condition at a time when he was partnering with a team at Stanford University to study why some children recover better from strep infections than others. So when the coronavirus came on the scene, Bustamante, a population geneticist by training, became curious about what patterns could emerge from individuals who contracted the virus and how they recovered. Very quickly, he asked his Stanford colleagues to keep all the coronavirus swabs they collected at the clinic so that he could study the valuable genetic material they held. ""I viewed this COVID epidemic as a once-in-a-generation opportunity to follow people longitudinally,"" he says. ""We could sequence that material and link it to health record data to prospectively follow a person\'s progress.""', 'When it came to collecting genetic samples, Bustamante prioritized diversity. As a Venezuelan American, he recognized the importance of representing Hispanic Latinos adequately in genetic datasets.', '""We\'ve known that we can do genetic mapping in Latin American populations for over 40 years,"" he says, in a nod to the fact that the gene for Huntington disease was discovered in Venezuela. ""I wanted to build that map, both for Latin America and for patients suffering from neuropsychiatric, cardiological, or metabolic conditions.""', 'Later in 2020, Bustamante cofounded Galatea Bio with Nicholas Katsanis and Alexander Ioannidis with the goal of expanding the diversity of genetic datasets beyond European communities to understand health disparities. The Florida-based company partners with organizations across the Americas to access genetic materials from Latin and South American populations to power research. It also offers ancestry-adjusted clinical genetic tests based on proprietary generative AI technology in-licensed from his work as a professor at Stanford and investigator at Chan Zuckerberg Biohub.', 'When Bustamante started the company, less than 1% of biobank samples that existed worldwide were from Latin American populations. The overwhelming majority-about 90%-were from individuals of European ancestry. And considering that over 650 million Latin Americans represent more than 700 ethnic groups across 33 countries, Bustamante saw the potential to understand and improve their health outcomes.', ""The genetics of those populations and individuals are recorded in the Biobank of the Americas-a key part of Galatea's business and vision. The CAP-accredited biobank has the capacity to house 10 million DNA samples. Galatea uses Illumina NovaSeq 6000 and NextSeq 2000 Systems to sequence genomes. In the near future, Bustamante is looking forward to sequencing genomes on Illumina's newly released NovaSeq X Plus System."", ""Galatea worked with hospitals that were collecting nasal swabs from patients coming in for COVID-19. These so-called COVID discards were invaluable for Bustamante's team. The swabs were already stored in a medium that readily allowed researchers to extract and sequence the DNA. The original research team at Stanford and Chan Zuckerberg built an AI/machine learning model that included clinical, genomic, and epidemiological features to predict COVID severity."", 'Galatea has since expanded to partner with blood banks and hospitals in Colombia, Paraguay, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and throughout Latin America to collect genetic samples. Bustamante is especially interested in using this genetic information to understand how responsive a patient will be to a particular drug. For instance, Puerto Ricans and Mexicans bookend the spectrum when it comes to asthma rates in the Americas: Puerto Ricans have the highest asthma rates while Mexicans have the lowest. Puerto Ricans also have the lowest response to albuterol, which is the most prescribed medication for asthma. Bustamante says that a person\'s response to the drug depends on a combination of environment, genes, and possibly epigenetics: ""We\'re trying to work with groups that are interested in these kinds of problems, and eventually improve the compendium of medications that can benefit everybody.""', 'In addition to sampling from relevant populations, he\'s also looking to give back to the individuals and communities who contribute to the Biobank of the Americas. Currently, participants who submit their samples can access their own ancestry test results-or they can always opt out of the project if they later change their minds. ""It\'s all part of the right way of doing research, engaging the community, and being really upfront about what we\'re doing, why we\'re doing it, and what people can learn,"" he says. Galatea Bio also offers clinical genetic laboratory-developed tests, including whole-genome sequencing, whole-exome sequencing, and ancestry-adjusted panels for autism, hereditary cancer, immune dysregulation, cardiovascular disease, thyroid disease, and pharmacogenomics.', 'Bustamante hopes that the biobank Galatea is building can eventually facilitate an exchange of knowledge among investigators, individuals, and communities. Their goal is to have 10 million data points; the biobank currently has about half a million. ""We\'ll be at over a million by the end of this year, and we should be at 10 million by, say, 2026,"" Bustamante says. ""We already have one of the most diverse biobanks in the world. And we\'re really looking forward to being able to make use of the health care data that\'s been entrusted to us and do right by the communities we\'re working with.""', 'Galatea Bio President and CEO Carlos D.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to the 5 Best Electrical Infrastructure Stocks to Buy Now.', 'The United States is currently experiencing an infrastructure and utilities boom, with numerous projects underway in various states. This surge in construction activity is expected to catalyze a multi-year growth phase for leading infrastructure stocks. Concerns have long persisted regarding the aging infrastructure of the country. In November 2021, President Joe Biden took action by signing the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) to tackle this issue head-on. This legislation has paved the way for numerous infrastructure projects across the nation. To date, over 46,000 projects have received funding approval, encompassing a wide range of infrastructure developments, including advanced rapid transit corridors, harbor enhancements, water system upgrades, bridge renovations, airport expansions, railway tunnel constructions, fiber broadband installations, and port improvements. With a staggering $1.2 trillion allocated for spending, the top electrical infrastructure stocks stand to benefit significantly from this investment.', ""In terms of electricity generation, changes in policy, market conditions, and technological advancements are leading to significant transformations in fuel sources. These shifts are exerting new demands and challenges on the US electric grid, since the majority of the country's high-voltage transmission infrastructure dates back to the 1960s and 1970s and was not designed to support the current or projected future requirements of the grid. That said, currently the US electric grid supplies over 3,800 terawatt-hours of electricity to approximately 159 million residential, commercial, and industrial consumers."", 'However, looking toward the future, the utilities sector finds itself at the forefront of the transition from carbon-based fuels to renewable energy sources. In the first half of 2023, the energy sector witnessed a significant shift, marked by the largest proportion of private sector involvement in infrastructure projects, according to the World Bank. Notably, renewable energy sources dominated the landscape, with 99% of new energy projects dedicated to renewable sources.\xa0 The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, the aforementioned Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and the CHIPS and Science Act are anticipated to accelerate this transition by incentivizing the adoption of clean-energy alternatives and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, with forecasts indicating a potential doubling of the portion of US power generation from renewable sources by 2030.', 'In light of this, investors would do well to keep some of the best electrical infrastructure stocks on their radars, seeing as these companies are exposed to infrastructure spending in the US.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the cannabis industry in America, the effect of legalization on prices, and the budding cannabis-based pharmaceutical industry, and go directly to the 5 States with the Cheapest Weed in America.\xa0', 'In the United States, marijuana wasn’t widely used for recreational purposes until the early 1900s. After the Mexican revolution of 1910, immigrants from the southern neighbor flooded into the U.S., introducing the recreational use of cannabis to American culture.\xa0', 'Massive unemployment and social unrest during the Great Depression stoked resentment of Mexican immigrants and public fear of the ‘evil weed’. As a result, and consistent with the Prohibition era’s view of all intoxicants, these political and racial factors led to the criminalization of marijuana in 1937 with the passage of the Marijuana Tax Act. But its legal status is now changing in many places.', 'The United States of America is the country that buys the most weed in the world. The American legal cannabis industry took some hits in 2022, but as we mentioned in our article – 35 Cities with the Highest Weed Consumption per Capita – annual revenue of the industry was estimated at $31.8 billion by the end of 2023, growing to $50.7 billion by 2028. The increasing legalization of cannabis and rising acceptance of its use for medical purposes are the key factors driving the growth of the market.\xa0', 'Growth is also expected to come from new states. In the first two months of 2023, three states began cannabis sales – two adult-use (Connecticut and Maryland) and one medical (Mississippi). As of March 2024, 24 states have legalized recreational weed in America, in addition to the District of Columbia.', 'All the diverse effects of legalizing recreational marijuana may not be clear for a number of years, but one consequence has become evident almost immediately – Weed has never been so cheap in America. The retail price of a gram of cannabis dropped 13% to $9.43 in Q3 of 2022 from $10.83 in the same period the previous year – the steepest fall ever seen for marijuana in a 1-year period.\xa0', 'In some cases, legalizing cannabis has caused its prices to drop by up to 90%, when compared with prices during prohibition. At the peak in the 90’s, you could get $6,000 a pound for indoor OG Kush in California. Right now, farmers are reportedly getting $600 a pound for that very same strain. Notably, even high taxes on legal marijuana don’t keep the legal price anywhere near what it was when the drug was more broadly illegal.\xa0', 'The major reason for this drastic decrease is Econ 101 – Supply and Demand. As the cannabis industry has boomed since legalization started a few years ago, more and more players have popped up to grab their slice of the sweet green ganja pie, which has resulted in an increasing number of growers producing more weed than stores know what to do with. The black market is also forced to drive prices down as the legal market gets more competitive.\xa0', 'Competition among cannabis growers is also increasing as more cities allow operations. In 2021, the number of municipalities allowing marijuana businesses jumped to 118 from 87 in Michigan alone, while the number of licensed businesses jumped by nearly 150 to 1,238. Between 2020 and 2022, the number of growers nearly quadrupled to 1,238, and more than a third of those – 458 – are classified as Class C, larger operations that can harvest 2,000 to 10,000 plants.\xa0', 'Legalizing the plant also opens doors to more innovation. Cannabis is an annual plant that gets planted in the spring and usually harvested in the fall. But farmers figured out that they could trick the plant into flowering early by depriving it of light and creating ‘longer nights’. This is done by throwing tarps over a greenhouse while the day is still going, making the plant think that it’s actually the fall and the night is really long. Light Deprivation has completely revolutionized cannabis cultivation and consumers will now be able to have the best products year-round and pay very low prices for it.\xa0', 'Prohibition imposes huge costs on drug producing industries that are passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. These higher prices are among the principal reasons (the others being stigma and fear of punishment) that illegal drugs are used so much less frequently than legal drugs such as alcohol and tobacco. Marijuana is a rare example where we can see the impact of legalizing a drug in real time, which shows that if the production and sale of heroin and cocaine etc. were also legalized, those drugs would also become dramatically cheaper.', 'The FDA understands that there is increasing interest in the potential utility of cannabis for a variety of medical conditions. In 2018, the federal watchdog approved the country’s first-ever drug derived from marijuana – Epidiolex. Produced by GW Pharmaceuticals, the drug is used to treat two rare forms of epilepsy.\xa0', 'The $7.2 billion acquisition of GW Pharmaceuticals by the global biopharma giant Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (NASDAQ:JAZZ) in 2021 is the latest sign of the growing legitimacy and increased receptivity of cannabis-based drugs in the pharma industry. With the new purchase, Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (NASDAQ:JAZZ) – which has focused primarily on sleep medications and oncology – has augmented its neuroscience portfolio. Net product sales of Epidiolex reached $746.4 million in 2022 – an increase of 12% from the previous year – according to an announcement by Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (NASDAQ:JAZZ).\xa0', 'Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) has also entered the medical cannabis industry, betting on a promising cannabinoid-based bowel disease treatment. In December 2021, the industry giant announced the acquisition of the clinical-stage company Arena Pharmaceuticals for a total equity value of around $6.7 billion. By acquiring all shares of Arena for $100 per share in an all-cash transition, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) has joined other big pharma companies in the cannabis space.\xa0', 'Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) ranks among the 10 Highest Dividend-Paying Stocks in the S&P 500.\xa0', 'With that said, here are the States with the Lowest Prices of Weed in America.\xa0', 'Copyright: atomazul / 123RF Stock Photo', 'To collect data for this article, we have referred to the Price of Weed – a global user-submitted price index for marijuana – looking for the States with the Cheapest Weed.

As for legal marijuana, it’s still restrictive and requires prescription.\xa0', 'One of the factors contributing to the low prices of weed in the Lone Star State is that pot grown in Mexico and sold in Houston and other Texas cities still goes for about the same price as 25 years ago.\xa0', 'Average Price of Weed per Ounce: $317.38', 'Weed is consumed in Georgia on a wide scale basis despite the illegality of its use.

However, It is a restrictive and expensive environment. Once a bank notifies regulators that it is working with cannabis-related businesses, it is designated as a CRB. The CRB banks are subject to more oversight by the FDIC, and hence charge higher fees for their services.\xa0', 'Adult-use cannabis sales in 2022 reached $950 million, soaring to 70% of the state’s total marijuana sales for the year. Phoenix is among the Cities with the Highest Weed Consumption in the World.\xa0', 'Average Price of Weed per Ounce: $289.09', 'According to a 2022 cannabis industry job report, Michigan ranks 3rd in the country by the number of people employed in its cannabis industry.

Meta, formerly Facebook, has tried and failed many times over the years to drive broad adoption of payments through its platform via P2P and a cryptocurrency venture."", 'While many of those obstacles remain, the emergence of embedded finance and its ability to connect to banking services within all types of media is renewing the ambitions of certain czars in social media, P2P payments and blockchain technology.', 'Musk is pushing ahead with plans to roll out a P2P service and his company X, formerly Twitter, will soon secure a money-transmitter license in New York and is a few months away from getting one in California, Musk reportedly said at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media & Telecom Conference on March 7.', 'X already has money-transmitter licenses in Pennsylvania, Utah, Kansas, South Dakota and Wyoming, and the firm is working on obtaining permission in all of the other U.S. states.', 'The challenges ahead', ""Along with rising waves of fraud and scams plaguing existing P2P services and social media platforms, observers see other reasons to doubt X's chances for getting many users to rely on its P2P services."", '""X is starting from a deep hole, and I am skeptical of their ability to scale up with the level of competition in the market,"" said Aaron McPherson, a principal with AFM Consulting, adding that he sees no compelling reason for consumers to turn to X for P2P services.', '""What is X\'s competitive differentiator in P2P? The level of toxicity on the platform means that it will be consigned to niche status, because merchants will be worried about their brands appearing next to offensive content,"" McPherson said, noting that X has no consumer financial services foundation to build on.', 'X would also face fierce competition from established P2P providers already rooted in financial services with their own footholds in social media.', 'For example, despite ongoing reports of sporadic fraud, the bank-owned P2P service Zelle has become so well entrenched since launching in 2017 that its transaction rate reached $100 million an hour during the final quarter of 2023. PayPal and its Venmo P2P unit, which pioneered social payments by enabling users to broadcast their transactions in a social media-like feed, also has a huge head start on X, McPherson said.', 'PayPal has been at work for years trying to develop an all-in-one app that would combine P2P, shopping, deals and links to social media. Under new CEO Alex Chriss, the firm recently said it plans to sell off extraneous businesses and refine financial services for PayPal and Venmo users.', 'Block aims to do something similar. Dorsey recently said he plans to create a ""social bank"" by linking Block\'s various financial services resources — its Square payments and commerce platform for small and midsize businesses, the popular Cash App P2P product and the Afterpay buy now/pay later services — in a central hub.', 'Cash App is ""inherently social,"" with users posting their Cash App address on social media, emails and other channels, Dorsey told analysts last month when announcing fourth-quarter 2023 earnings, and he\'s aiming to make Cash App the hub of the social bank, which would connect consumers directly to Block\'s growing range financial services, including Square checking, savings and loan products.', '""Being a social bank [we\'re] starting with peer-to-peer, but expanding beyond that and really getting in the neighborhoods and local communities,"" Dorsey said.', ""But the biggest obstacles each of these concepts face right now is fraud that's infecting online shopping portals, as well as a growing number of fake websites masquerading as legitimate e-commerce portals. All of these are spread through social media."", 'A question of trust', 'The Federal Trade Commission recently said social media platform-based scams accounted for $1.5 billion in losses last year, and the Wall Street Journal this month reported that Facebook Marketplace is swamped by fraud-driven bots and other schemes.', ""Lawmakers are pushing for interventions — Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee have asked Zelle parent Early Warning Services to clarify its consumer reimbursement policies related to scams, and federal regulators reportedly are probing gaps in Cash App's security protocols — just as Musk and Dorsey prepare to launch social media-powered payments."", 'Block has a multi-layered approach to preventing fraud and scams leveraging Cash App, and late last year, the firm launched a social media campaign with three 30-second spots educating consumers about risks and red flags.', 'Meta also provides Facebook users with a raft of fraud-prevention tools and warnings about scams, but several U.S. banks and credit unions have recently warned consumers about associated risks.', '""Trust is a very important element for adding financial services to social media,"" said Galia Beer-Gabel, a partner at Tel Aviv-based Team8, a venture capital and company-building firm, who says that most existing P2P services cannot expand further on social media without achieving breakthroughs in security and interoperability. Recent advancements in real-time payments around the world — including Pix in Brazil, UPI in India and broad adoption of instant payments in the U.K. — demonstrate the potential for building secure domestic P2P payments networks that connect to social media, but they are still evolving and unique to each country, she said.', 'Meta tried to achieve such a breakthrough in 2019 by founding a cryptocurrency consortium called the Diem Association, which aimed to create a global cross-platform payments network, but it folded two years later.', 'Ultimately, a big-tech firm like Apple or Google, or even Meta, may find a path to create an interoperable cross-border P2P service because of their existing mass adoption and direct connections to consumers, ""but each has their own complexities and there\'s the problem of having too much power concentrated in the hands of for-profit companies,"" Beer-Gabel said.', 'Cryptocurrency and blockchain firms could also develop trusted and secure P2P systems, if they can convince users to look past crypto\'s current volatility, she said. ""Crypto and blockchain in general are decentralized, without giving governments or banks or companies too much power, but today no one can point to one mass-adopted crypto service.""', 'Building consumer trust, improving security and expanding the utility of these services through faster payments will be key to their adoption on social media platforms, Beer-Gabel concluded. ""It comes down to who can connect the dots most effectively,"" she said.']"

That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend aristocrats and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 10 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats To Buy According to Analysts.\xa0', 'Investors often grapple with the decision of whether to invest in growth stocks or value stocks. While both strategies aim to enhance value for investors, they follow distinct paths. The primary distinction lies in the pricing. Growth stocks tend to be pricier, with high valuations relative to their sales or earnings. Conversely, value stocks are more affordable, with lower stock prices in comparison to their sales or earnings. Over time, both growth and value investment approaches have demonstrated comparable performance, yet historical analysis indicates that value investing has been more advantageous for investors in the long term. According to research published by Josef Lakonishok, Andrei Shleifer, and Robert W. Vishny in the Journal of Finance, value strategies tend to yield superior returns. Various investment strategies centered around purchasing undervalued stocks have consistently outperformed those focused on trendy or high-flying stocks from April 1968 to April 1990.', 'The research paper also emphasized that value stocks typically offer significantly higher dividend yields and possess stronger fundamental ratios compared to growth stocks. Both Josef Lakonishok and the value investing expert David Dreman have observed that value investing outperforms growth investing approximately 70% of the time, regardless of the size of the companies involved. Their studies, which encompassed various company sizes, revealed that value stocks consistently delivered average returns of slightly over 7% per year higher than growth stocks over extended periods.', 'As mentioned earlier, dividends are often a key component of value stocks. Among dividend strategies, one of the most popular approaches is investing in dividend aristocrats. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index tracks the performance of companies within the S&P 500 that have consistently increased their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. A report from S&P Dow Jones Indices indicated that strategies focusing on generating income often exhibit significant value characteristics. Investors typically gravitate towards securities offering high dividend yields and lower price multiples. The report also mentioned that the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index demonstrated a blend of both growth and value traits, rather than a pronounced bias towards one style. Analysis of the index composition from 1999 to 2022 revealed its style breakdown. On average, the index maintained a 59.04% exposure to value stocks and a 40.94% exposure to growth stocks during this period.', 'Despite the allure of high-priced growth stocks, value stocks have consistently proven to be advantageous for investors over the long haul. Dimensional Funds conducted an analysis spanning nearly a century, affirming that value stocks typically offer higher expected returns. While there have been occasional downturns, the fundamental principle that lower relative prices correlate with higher expected returns remains steadfast. Value premiums have often manifested swiftly and significantly. For instance, in years when value outperformed growth, the average premium amounted to nearly 15%. On average, in the US, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks by 4.4% annually from 1927 to 2022.', ""Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Emerson Electric Co.

That was back in the 80s and 90s, when mainframe computers and then personal computers first started to become common. IBM's hardware was a centerpiece of the movement. The company even remained relatively relevant into the early 2000s."", ""Slowly but surely, however, competition chipped away at its dominance. Its sales ultimately peaked in 2012 because IBM didn't do much to address then-nascent opportunities like cloud computing, mobile devices, and cybersecurity. It's been so long since IBM has mattered that many investors have all but forgotten about it."", ""Well, IBM is back. It can't be said that it's better than ever. But it's looking like a more promising investment than it has in a long, long time. This new IBM, though, is very different than the hardware-centric one that older investors might recall from yesteryear."", ""IBM has managed a consulting business for decades now, even if this work was entirely related to the use of its systems. And, for as long as its computers could be programmed, the company's supplied some sort of software."", ""The importance of these different operations has been shaken up over the course of the past several years, however. Software has become IBM's single biggest source of revenue as the company turns up the heat on hybrid cloud computing. Its consulting business is still sizable, but it's a distant second now, with infrastructure (hardware) running a close third in terms of sales."", ""This might be surprising to investors who remember what IBM used to be. But it shouldn't be too surprising. This is a change the company's known was coming -- and even intended -- for years now."", ""As CFO James Kavanaugh reminded investors last month at Morgan Stanley's annual Technology, Media and Telecom Conference, for every dollar's worth of systems that IBM sells, it generates an additional $3 to $5 worth of eventual software revenue and between $6 and $8 worth of services sales. One product or service doesn't really work without the other. This is how the company's top and bottom lines have remained so stable of late, even if the growth rates for both are modest."", ""That's only half of the bullish picture for this particular business model, though. What's not highlighted by these numbers is how this platform/software/services mix drives the greatest degree of revenue for the company's highest-margin business. That's software. Roughly 80% of IBM's software sales are converted into gross profits, making it (by a country mile) the company's top income driver."", ""Surprised? Don't be. Think about it. Hardware is manufacturing-intensive since each unit produced requires the purchase of several technological components. Consulting requires people. Software, however, is very different. Once the code is written, it can be readily copied and distributed at little to no cost."", 'This shift in the business model is a two-edged sword. While it sets the stage for consistent sales and earnings, it also limits potential growth rates. IBM sells systems at competitive, lower-margin prices in order to spur higher-margin service and software sales. The ensuing cloud-centric software and consulting revenue, though, is only booked on a quarterly basis from that point forward. It could take years for a customer to update their tech with the purchase of a new platform that prompts a new service or consulting contract, or renews the need for software to make the hardware work.', ""In many ways, though, this model simplifies the business into one that IBM can execute very well. The ultimate goal is simply bringing more clients into the fold. Once they're onboard, they'll likely remain onboard as paying customers for a while. Indeed, some of them will remain lifetime customers just because they're already familiar with IBM's offerings."", ""As for investors, IBM's shift toward a services- and software-oriented business model bodes well for the company's future cash flow, and for this tech stock's future dividends. To this end, IBM is expecting free cash flow of $12 billion this year. That's up from last year's figure of $11.2 billion, which is up from only $9.3 billion a year earlier. You can plug into this cash cow while the stock's dividend yield stands at 3.4%. By the way, this yield is based on a dividend that's been raised every year for the past 28 years."", 'James Brumley has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher.

So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth."", 'In the case of IBM, the consensus sales estimate of $14.56 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2.2%.

On Friday, the stock prices of Valero Energy VLO, Marathon Petroleum MPC and Phillips 66 PSX climbed to their all-time highs of $166.10, $195.12 and $159.74, respectively. On the day, each of them saw their share price increase about 3%. This jump marks a year-to-date ascent of somewhere between 20% and 30% for the operators.', ""Obviously, the recent rise in oil prices has played a key role in the abovementioned companies' surge. That's a big boon for VLO, MPC and PSX, given that it drives prices at the pumps.During the past week, crude oil surged to its highest levels in four months, surpassing $81 per barrel. This upward momentum was driven by significant decreases in U.S. crude and gasoline inventories, along with an optimistic demand projection from the International Energy Agency (“IEA”). Additionally, ongoing production cuts by OPEC and its allies, coupled with drone attacks on Russian energy facilities in Ukraine, bolstered crude prices.The IEA revised its forecast for oil demand growth upward for the current year and predicted a slight supply deficit through 2024, contrary to earlier expectations of a surplus. In its monthly report, the IEA raised its estimate for crude oil demand growth in 2024 by 110,000 barrels per day (bbl/day) to 1.3 million bbl/day, citing a stronger outlook for the U.S. market and increased fuel demand in shipping due to longer routes taken to avoid Red Sea conflicts. The agency also lowered its supply forecast for non-OPEC countries.Escalating attacks on Russian energy infrastructure and persistent uncertainty surrounding the Israel-Palestine conflict were additional factors contributing to the uptick in oil prices. Furthermore, a positive development was the Energy Information Administration's (‘EIA’) report, which revealed the first decline in U.S. crude inventories in seven weeks, accompanied by a significant drop in gasoline inventories. Prior to this, oil prices had been rising following Saudi Arabia's agreement with OPEC+ partners earlier in the month to extend production cuts of around 2 million bbl/day until mid-year.The downstream operators also benefited from the surge in gasoline prices, as U.S. refiners completed planned maintenance activities. As a result, domestic refinery utilization rates remained below 87% for eight consecutive weeks, marking the longest period of such low utilization in three years."", 'Continuing the ascension of of Valero Energy, Marathon Petroleum and Phillips 66 shares were their favorable fourth-quarter results that widely surpassed the bottom-line expectations during the period.VLO’s Q4 earnings of $3.55 per share breezed past the Zacks Consensus of $2.95 a share by 20%. Similarly, MPC easily surpassed Q4 earnings expectations with EPS at $3.98 per share and 69% above estimates of $2.36 a share.

But if you pay close attention, you might find that its key financial indicators look quite decent, which could mean that the stock could potentially rise in the long-term given how markets usually reward more resilient long-term fundamentals. Specifically, we decided to study Analog Devices'  ROE in this article."", ""Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders."", ' View our latest analysis for Analog Devices ', 'The formula for ROE is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Analog Devices is:', '7.9% = US$2.8b ÷ US$36b (Based on the trailing twelve months to February 2024).', ""The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.08 in profit."", 'Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don\'t have the same features.', ""At first glance, Analog Devices' ROE doesn't look very promising. A quick further study shows that the company's ROE doesn't compare favorably to the industry average of 14% either. In spite of this, Analog Devices was able to grow its net income considerably, at a rate of 23% in the last five years. So, there might be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently."", ""We then performed a comparison between Analog Devices' net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 29% in the same 5-year period."", ""The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is ADI fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know."", 'Analog Devices has a significant three-year median payout ratio of 60%, meaning the company only retains 40% of its income. This implies that the company has been able to achieve high earnings growth despite returning most of its profits to shareholders.', ""Additionally, Analog Devices has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 45% over the next three years. As a result, the expected drop in Analog Devices' payout ratio explains the anticipated rise in the company's future ROE to 14%, over the same period."", ""Overall, we feel that Analog Devices certainly does have some positive factors to consider. That is, quite an impressive growth in earnings. However, the low profit retention means that the company's earnings growth could have been higher, had it been reinvesting a higher portion of its profits. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

SWK is benefiting from solid momentum in the engineered fastening business despite lower consumer outdoor and DIY market demand, and escalating expenses.Let us discuss the factors why investors should retain the stock for the time being.', ""Business Strength: Solid momentum in the engineered fastening business, driven by strength in aerospace and auto end markets is aiding the engineered fastening business. The company’s global cost-reduction program is expected to aid its bottom line and drive margin performance in the quarters ahead. Stanley Black is making efforts to eliminate and reduce overlapping capabilities and functions. It is resizing operations to ensure that resources better serve core businesses.In 2023, it generated pre-tax run rate savings of $835 million from a global cost-reduction program. The company expects to generate run rate savings of $1.5 billion by the end of 2024. By 2025, it envisions run rate savings of $2 billion. Supply-chain optimization programs and inventory reduction efforts are also expected to boost margins. In 2023, the company reduced its inventory by $1.1 billion. Benefiting from supply-chain transformation and inventory reductions, Stanley Black expects to achieve adjusted gross margins of more than 30% in 2024.Focus on Core Operations: Stanley Black has been divesting non-core operations to drive growth. In December 2023, Stanley Black inked a deal to divest its STANLEY Infrastructure (Infrastructure) business to Epiroc AB for a cash amount of $760 million. The divestment will help Stanley Black focus on the core businesses while supporting its capital-allocation priorities. The company expects to use the cash proceeds of the transaction, net of modest taxes, to reduce its debt. The completion of the deal is conditioned on regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.In July 2022, the company sold its Security Business to Securitas AB for $3.2 billion cash. It funded its debt reduction from the net proceeds of this sale. In the same month, it divested its Automatic Doors business to Allegion for $900 million in cash. The divestitures reinforce Stanley Black's strategic focus on its core businesses. In June 2022, the company inked a deal to sell its STANLEY oil & gas division to Pipeline Technique Limited.

While both strategies aim to enhance value for investors, they follow distinct paths. The primary distinction lies in the pricing. Growth stocks tend to be pricier, with high valuations relative to their sales or earnings. Conversely, value stocks are more affordable, with lower stock prices in comparison to their sales or earnings. Over time, both growth and value investment approaches have demonstrated comparable performance, yet historical analysis indicates that value investing has been more advantageous for investors in the long term. According to research published by Josef Lakonishok, Andrei Shleifer, and Robert W. Vishny in the Journal of Finance, value strategies tend to yield superior returns. Various investment strategies centered around purchasing undervalued stocks have consistently outperformed those focused on trendy or high-flying stocks from April 1968 to April 1990.', 'The research paper also emphasized that value stocks typically offer significantly higher dividend yields and possess stronger fundamental ratios compared to growth stocks. Both Josef Lakonishok and the value investing expert David Dreman have observed that value investing outperforms growth investing approximately 70% of the time, regardless of the size of the companies involved. Their studies, which encompassed various company sizes, revealed that value stocks consistently delivered average returns of slightly over 7% per year higher than growth stocks over extended periods.', 'As mentioned earlier, dividends are often a key component of value stocks. Among dividend strategies, one of the most popular approaches is investing in dividend aristocrats. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index tracks the performance of companies within the S&P 500 that have consistently increased their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. A report from S&P Dow Jones Indices indicated that strategies focusing on generating income often exhibit significant value characteristics. Investors typically gravitate towards securities offering high dividend yields and lower price multiples. The report also mentioned that the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index demonstrated a blend of both growth and value traits, rather than a pronounced bias towards one style. Analysis of the index composition from 1999 to 2022 revealed its style breakdown. On average, the index maintained a 59.04% exposure to value stocks and a 40.94% exposure to growth stocks during this period.', 'Despite the allure of high-priced growth stocks, value stocks have consistently proven to be advantageous for investors over the long haul. Dimensional Funds conducted an analysis spanning nearly a century, affirming that value stocks typically offer higher expected returns. While there have been occasional downturns, the fundamental principle that lower relative prices correlate with higher expected returns remains steadfast. Value premiums have often manifested swiftly and significantly. For instance, in years when value outperformed growth, the average premium amounted to nearly 15%. On average, in the US, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks by 4.4% annually from 1927 to 2022.', ""Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Emerson Electric Co.

(“Jay”) Rasulo on the BLUE Proxy Card', 'NEW YORK, March 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Trian Group,1 which beneficially owns $3.5 billion of common stock in The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS), today released a letter to its fellow Disney shareholders. The full text of the letter is below and available to view online at: https://restorethemagic.com/03-18-2024/.', 'Dear Fellow Walt Disney Company Shareholder:', 'Disney’s 2024 Annual Meeting will be held on April 3, and it is time for you to vote to help Restore the Magic at Disney.', 'For more than a century, Disney has captivated millions of people all over the world with unforgettable films and experiences. Like you, Trian loves Disney and wants to see the Company succeed. With its iconic franchises, global presence and scale, unparalleled customer loyalty and enviable commercial flywheel, Disney and its shareholders should prosper.', 'But despite its many advantages, Disney has lost its way. Disney fell from its #1 position at the box office,2 was late to enter the streaming business3 and doubled down on linear TV at the wrong time.4 As a result, financial performance has deteriorated, with earnings per share, free cash flow, operating income and many other key metrics lower than they were five years ago.5', 'Consequently, shareholders have suffered. Disney’s stock has underperformed its media peers and the broader market over most relevant periods: over the past one, two, three, four and five years.6', 'Change Is Needed', 'To help ensure a better future for this great company, we believe Disney needs new independent directors who have a shareholder mindset, deep and relevant experience and a sense of urgency.', 'We have nominated two such candidates: Nelson Peltz and Jay Rasulo, each of whom have invested their own money in Disney stock and are dedicated to helping Disney. Nelson was a public company CEO and has served on the boards of many public companies facing performance, governance and CEO succession challenges, just like Disney. Jay is the former Chief Financial Officer of Disney and ran the Company’s parks and resorts business before that.', 'Nelson and Jay pledge to work together with the other members of the Board and Disney’s leadership team to enhance corporate governance and accountability, accelerate media profitability, review Disney’s creative engine and clarify the Company’s strategic focus. We believe Nelson and Jay will be a catalyst for much needed positive change.', 'We are seeking to replace two long-serving Disney directors whose backgrounds and skills are not, in our view, relevant to Disney’s current challenges or likely to assist in its turnaround: Michael B.G. Froman and Maria Elena Lagomasino. Mr. Froman is President of the Council on Foreign Relations (where another Disney director is on the board) and Ms. Lagomasino helps organize the affairs of wealthy families. Whatever their strengths and skills in foreign affairs and wealth management, the cold truth is that neither of them has helped Disney retain its leadership position in the media landscape; neither of them has aligned executive pay with performance;7 and neither of them has facilitated an orderly CEO transition.8 Instead, under their watch, Disney has fallen – its fundamental financial performance is worse,9 and its stock has underperformed.10', 'Disney can do better. But it needs some fresh thinking.', 'We Have Helped Drive Change', 'At Trian, we have recommended and nominated directors at more than two dozen companies over the course of our history. Nelson Peltz has served on 11 public company boards himself and is one of the most experienced corporate directors in America. Time and again, Nelson and our other candidates have proven to be productive and collaborative directors; they have overseen major business transformations11 and successful leadership transitions12 and have helped drive growth13 and create value14 for all shareholders.', 'The simple fact is that Trian suggests candidates for boards in an effort to help, and our candidates focus their energy entirely on trying to create value for shareholders. Our fresh perspective and shareholder mindset, coupled with a genuine dedication to collegiality and collaboration, and long-term focus are a powerful combination. Great companies that have lost their way – like Disney – often thrive after new directors, nominated by Trian, are appointed.15', 'Just ask the companies themselves: executives at Mondelēz, Sysco and Wendy’s, for example, have praised our directors for working constructively in the boardroom.16 Even CEOs of companies that initially opposed the appointment of Mr. Peltz – Heinz, DuPont and Procter & Gamble – later commended him as constructive and collaborative.17', 'Accepting Change is Hard', 'Admittedly, our relationships with companies, and with other directors, do not always start with such positive feelings. Sometimes to deflect from performance issues, corporate boards attempt to sow uncertainty about Trian and our candidates, warning that we will be “disruptive” or that our candidates will “not add value.”18', 'Disney has taken this approach to an extreme. Disney’s Board has claimed that the election of Nelson and Jay threatens to “impede,”19 “disrupt”20 and “derail”21 the Company’s supposed progress. They have disingenuously touted “endorsements” from “experts”22 who are, in fact, just service providers or advisors to Disney that have been highly compensated by the Company. Disney has used inflammatory rhetoric, claiming that our candidates (one of whom is Disney’s own former CFO) are “oblivious”23 and that our ideas are “inane.”24', 'We have been here before.', 'We know that companies sometimes fear and resist change. But we also know that turnarounds are not easy and often require objective thinking and new ideas.', 'To Disney’s incumbent directors, we say this: we are not here to upset, interrupt or reverse Disney’s progress, or frustrate the Board or leadership team. We love Disney; we are a large investor and we come with the sole purpose of helping the Company get back to delighting consumers and delivering strong returns for shareholders. We look forward to the opportunity to do so together, with you, from inside the boardroom.', 'Vote for Change ', 'Nelson Peltz and Jay Rasulo have dedicated themselves to helping build a better future for this iconic company. Like you, we want Disney to improve the guest experience at its parks and on its cruises; create unforgettable, industry-leading films and television content; and deliver sustainable growth and value for shareholders for generations to come.', 'We are confident that, given its many advantages, Disney can do better. But we need your help.', 'Together, we can elect two new independent directors who will bring focus, alignment and accountability to the Company’s boardroom. Together, we can Restore the Magic at Disney.', 'To ensure the election of Nelson Peltz and Jay Rasulo, it is essential that shareholders vote FOR Nelson Peltz and Jay Rasulo and WITHHOLD on Michael B.G. Froman, Maria Elena Lagomasino and all three Blackwells Nominees. Please use the enclosed BLUE proxy card.', 'P.S. If you voted already, it is not too late to switch your vote and support Trian’s Nominees, Nelson Peltz and Jay Rasulo.

Note that ownership position values are based on Disney’s share price at the close of business on March 15, 2024.2 Trian presentation, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on 03/04/24 (“Trian’s White Paper”) at page 106.3 Id. at page 30.4 Id. at pages 58-60.5 Id. at page 9.6 FactSet. Note: Disney performance measures total shareholder return (“TSR”) through 03/15/24 defined as the total return an investor would have received if they purchased one share of stock on the first day of the measured period, inclusive of share price appreciation and dividends paid. “Media Peers” represents the simple average of “Media Industry Peers” as defined in Disney’s 2024 Definitive Proxy Statement and consists of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Comcast, Meta, Netflix, Paramount, and Warner Bros. Discovery; “Broader Market” represents the S&P 500 which we highlight here only as a widely recognized index, however, for various reasons the performance of the index and that of the securities mentioned above may not be comparable. One cannot invest directly in an index.7 Since Ms. Lagomasino became Chair of Disney’s Compensation Committee, Disney’s say-on-pay votes have averaged just 73%, which ranks in the bottom 10% of all S&P 500 companies and Disney’s say-on-pay approval percentages have been below the S&P 500 median every year. Say-on-pay has also been below the average of all of the S&P 500 companies since 2018, which is Mr. Froman’s tenure on the Board.8 Trian’s White Paper at page 64.9 Trian’s White Paper at page 9.10 FactSet. Disney’s stock has underperformed Media Peers and the Broader Market over one, three and five years. See supra n. 6.11 At The Procter & Gamble Company (“P&G”), a household products company where Mr. Peltz served on the Board from 2018 until 2022, he helped P&G develop and oversee a “Four-Year Overhaul” that resulted in P&G “making several dramatic changes to help improve performance” and “streamlin[ing] its operations from 10 business units to six, improv[ing] its earnings growth, clear[ing] out bureaucracy and increas[ing] accountability.” (Source: Article titled “Peltz to Depart P&G Board, Capping Nearly Four-Year Overhaul,” published August 5, 2021 by Bloomberg.)12 Nelson Peltz has assisted six different boards with executing on successful succession plans since 2016: Unilever (2023), Janus Henderson (2022), P&G (2021), Sysco (2020), Mondelēz (2017) and Wendy’s (2016 and 2024).13 At Mondelēz International, an international snack company, during Mr. Peltz’s tenure on the board of directors from 2014 to 2018, the company improved its cash flow generation through margin improvement and development of working capital efficiencies. (Source: SEC filings. In 2014, operating income margins were 11.7% and improved to 16.7% in 2018. Cash flow from operations were $3.56 billion in 2014 and improved to $3.95 billion in 2018.)14 At Trian portfolio companies where Nelson Peltz has served on the board, those companies have delivered an average annualized TSR of 17%, from the first day Trian invested through 12/31/23 (or through a company’s sale date related to an acquisition), outperforming the S&P 500 by more than 500 bps and representing a 1600 bps improvement from the five-year period prior to Trian’s involvement. This TSR information does not represent, and should not be construed as describing, the performance of any funds, investment vehicles or accounts managed by Trian. Past TSR performance is not indicative of future TSR performance. Although Trian believes that the changes or improvements for certain companies identified herein were attributable in significant part to the cumulative effects of the implementation of operational and strategic initiatives during the period of Nelson and Trian’s active involvement, there is no objective method to confirm what portion of such growth was attributable to Nelson and Trian’s efforts and what may have been attributable to other factors.15 Id.16 See the “Third Party Perspectives” page of the Trian Group’s website, www.RestoreTheMagic.com, for a list of quotes from select former directors and executives with whom Trian’s partners have served on a public company board.17 Id.18 P&G Letter to Shareholders, 08/01/17.19 Disney Letter to Shareholders, 02/12/24.20 Disney Letter to Shareholders, 02/26/24.21 Disney Letter to Shareholders, 02/12/24.22 See the “Expert Analysis” page of Disney’s campaign website, which includes supportive quotes from Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, and Mason Morfit, the CEO of ValueAct Capital.

One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.31 in profit."", 'So far, we\'ve learned that ROE is a measure of a company\'s profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don\'t have the same features.', ""First thing first, we like that Devon Energy has an impressive ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 21% the company's ROE is quite impressive. So, the substantial 50% net income growth seen by Devon Energy over the past five years isn't overly surprising."", ""As a next step, we compared Devon Energy's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 36%."", 'Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock.

Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 29% over the next three years. However, Devon Energy's future ROE is expected to decline to 19% despite the expected decline in its payout ratio. We infer that there could be other factors that could be steering the foreseen decline in the company's ROE."", ""Overall, we are quite pleased with Devon Energy's performance. In particular, its high ROE is quite noteworthy and also the probable explanation behind its considerable earnings growth. Yet, the company is retaining a small portion of its profits. Which means that the company has been able to grow its earnings in spite of it, so that's not too bad. With that said, on studying the latest analyst forecasts, we found that while the company has seen growth in its past earnings, analysts expect its future earnings to shrink.

Java 22 (Oracle JDK 22) delivers thousands of performance, stability, and security improvements to help developers increase productivity, drive innovation, and accelerate growth across their organizations. These include enhancements to the Java language, its APIs and performance, and the tools included in the Java Development Kit (JDK)."", '""The new enhancements in Java 22 enable more developers to quickly and easily build and deliver feature-rich, scalable, and secure applications to help organizations across the globe grow their businesses,"" said Georges Saab, senior vice president, Oracle Java Platform and chair, OpenJDK governing board. ""By delivering enhancements that streamline application development and extend Java\'s reach to make it accessible to developers of all proficiency levels, Java 22 will help drive the creation of a wide range of new applications and services for organizations and developers alike.""', 'The latest JDK provides updates and improvements with 12 JDK Enhancement Proposals (JEPs). JDK 22 delivers language improvements from OpenJDK Project Amber (Statements before super[…], Unnamed Variables & Patterns, String Templates, and Implicitly Declared Classes and Instance Main Methods); enhancements from Project Panama (Foreign Function & Memory API and Vector API); features related to Project Loom (Structured Concurrency and Scoped Values); core libraries and tools capabilities (Class-File API, Launch Multi-File Source-Code Programs, and Stream Gatherers); and performance updates (Region Pinning for G1).', '""After nearly three decades, Java\'s ability to support complex development tasks that span a wide range of use cases makes the platform as relevant as it has ever been,"" said Arnal Dayaratna, research vice president, software development, IDC. ""Java\'s versatility and comprehensive toolset enables it to support the development of production-grade, mission-critical applications at scale, which positions it as a key enabling technology for innovative use cases such as generative AI.""', 'Significant updates delivered in Java 22 are:', 'Project Amber Features', 'JEP 447: Statements before super(…):\xa0Gives developers the freedom to express the behavior of constructors. By allowing statements that do not reference the instance being created to appear before an explicit constructor invocation, this feature enables a more natural placement of logic that needs to be factored into auxiliary static methods, auxiliary intermediate constructors, or constructor arguments. It also preserves the existing assurance that constructors run in top-down order during class instantiation, helping ensure that code in a subclass constructor cannot interfere with superclass instantiation. In addition, this feature does not require any changes to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and relies only on the current ability of the JVM to verify and execute code that appears before explicit constructor invocations within constructors.', 'JEP 456: Unnamed Variables & Patterns: Helps\xa0improve developer productivity by enhancing the Java language with unnamed variables and patterns, which can be used when variable declarations or nested patterns are required but never used. This reduces opportunities for error, improves the readability of record patterns, and increases the maintainability of all code.', 'JEP 459: String Templates (Second Preview):\xa0Simplifies the development of Java programs by making it easy to express strings that include values computed at run time, while also improving the security of programs that compose strings from user-provided values and pass them to other systems. Additionally, the readability of expressions mixed with text is enhanced, and non-string values computed from literal text and embedded expressions can be created without having to transit through an intermediate string representation.', 'JEP 463: Implicitly Declared Classes and Instance Main Methods (Second Preview):\xa0Helps accelerate learning by offering a smooth on-ramp to Java programming to enable students to write their first programs without needing to understand language features designed for large programs. With this feature, educators can introduce concepts in a gradual manner and students can write streamlined declarations for single-class programs and seamlessly expand their programs to use more advanced features as their skills grow.', 'Project Loom Features', 'JEP 462: Structured Concurrency (Second Preview):\xa0Helps developers streamline error handling and cancellation and enhance observability by introducing an API for structured concurrency. This helps promote a style of concurrent programming that can eliminate common risks arising from cancellation and shutdown – such as thread leaks and cancellation delays – and improves the observability of concurrent code.', ""JEP 464: Scoped Values (Second Preview):\xa0Helps increase ease-of-use, comprehensibility, performance, and robustness of developers' projects by enabling the sharing of immutable data within and across threads."", 'Project Panama Features', 'JEP 454: Foreign Function & Memory API:\xa0Increases ease-of-use, flexibility, safety, and performance for developers by introducing an API to enable Java programs to interoperate with code and data outside of the Java runtime. By efficiently invoking foreign functions such as code outside the Java Virtual Machine, and by safely accessing foreign memory (i.e., memory not managed by the JVM), the new API allows Java programs to call native libraries and process native data without requiring the Java Native Interface.', 'JEP 460: Vector API (Seventh Incubator):\xa0Enables developers to achieve performance superior to equivalent scalar computations by introducing an API to express vector computations that reliably compile at runtime to vector instructions on supported CPU architectures. ', 'Core Libraries & Tools Features', 'JEP 457: Class-File API (Preview): Helps developers improve productivity by providing a standard API for parsing, generating, and transforming Java class files.', 'JEP 458: Launch Multi-File Source-Code Programs:\xa0Enables developers to choose whether and when to configure a build tool by enhancing the Java application launcher to enable it to run a program supplied as multiple files of Java source code.', 'JEP 461: Stream Gatherers (Preview):\xa0Helps developers improve productivity by enhancing the Stream API to support custom intermediate operations, which will allow stream pipelines to transform data in ways that are not easily achievable with the existing built-in intermediate operations. By making stream pipelines more flexible and expressive and allowing custom intermediate operations to manipulate streams of infinite size, this feature enables developers to become more efficient in reading, writing, and maintaining Java code.', 'Performance Updates', 'JEP 423: Region Pinning for G1:\xa0Helps reduce latency by allowing some garbage collection to happen during some native library calls that would have otherwise needed to pause the collector. This is achieved by tracking which objects need to be blocked during these native library calls and ""pinning"" just the regions that contain these objects. This allows garbage collection to continue normally in unpinned regions, even during what would have otherwise been a blocking native library call.', 'The Java 22 release is the result of continuous collaboration between Oracle and other members of the worldwide Java developer community via OpenJDK and the Java Community Process (JCP). In addition to the new enhancements and features, Java 22 is supported by Java Management Service (JMS) – an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) native service – which offers a unified console and dashboard to help organizations manage Java runtimes and applications on-premises or in any cloud. For more details on the features in Java 22, please read the Java 22 technical blog post.', 'Supporting the Global Java Ecosystem with Innovation in the Cloud', 'Java delivers increased performance, efficiency, innovation, and cost savings when deployed in the cloud on OCI, which is one of the first hyperscale clouds to support Java 22.

The H100 and H200 chips have become the go-to GPUs for AI applications, helping to rocket Nvidia’s data center revenue over the last few quarters.', 'In its latest quarter alone, the company reported data center revenue of $18.4 billion. To put the segment’s growth into perspective, Nvidia reported annual revenue of $27 billion for all of 2022.', '“For three decades we’ve pursued accelerated computing with the goal of enabling transformative breakthroughs like deep learning and AI,” Huang said in a statement.', '“Generative AI is the defining technology of our time. Blackwell GPUs are the engine to power this new industrial revolution. Working with the most dynamic companies in the world, we will realize the promise of AI for every industry.”', 'Like its prior Hopper GPUs, the Blackwell GPU will be available as a standalone GPU, or two Blackwell GPUs can be combined and paired with Nvidia’s Grace central processing unit to create what it calls its GB200 Superchip.', 'That setup, the company says, will offer up to a 30x performance increase compared to the Nvidia H100 GPU for large language model inference workloads while using up to 25x less energy. That energy savings is an important part of the story.', 'Nvidia customers, including Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA), are currently using or actively developing their own in-house AI chips as alternatives to Nvidia’s offerings. Part of the reason for that is so that they don’t have to pay the tens of thousands of dollars Nvidia’s chips are estimated to cost. But the other reason is that Nvidia’s chips are especially power-hungry.', 'By talking up its energy savings with the Grace Blackwell Superchip, Nvidia is speaking directly to its customers’ concerns.', 'Nvidia says Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Oracle (ORCL) will be among the first companies to start offering access to Blackwell chips through their cloud platforms.', 'In addition to the Blackwell and Grace Blackwell chips, Nvidia also debuted its DGX SuperPOD supercomputer system. The DGX SuperPOD is made up of eight or more DGX Grace Blackwell 200 (GB200) systems, which include 36 Grace Blackwell 200 Superchips paired to run as a single computer. Nvidia says customers can scale up the SuperPOD to support tens of thousands of GB200 Superchips depending on their needs.', 'The DGX SuperPOD also gets a new liquid-cooled rack-scale architecture, which means the system is cooled off using fluid circulating through a series of pipes and radiators rather than straight-up fan-based air cooling, which can be less efficient and more energy intensive.', 'The Blackwell GPU and GB200 Superchip will be Nvidia’s new top-of-the-line leaders when it comes to AI training and inferencing, which means they’ll be in high demand the moment they hit the market.', 'But competitors AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) aren’t sitting idly by; they are almost certainly working on their own chips with the hopes of eventually catching Nvidia.', ""Daniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

So this is the stock year to date, up just about 11% but has been on a run. So they think at least it's fairly valued at this point, and that's why they're not raising their price target too much higher."", ""BRAD SMITH: Just for closure out there, for those that were wondering what structural node demand is here, I mean, I guess you just have to boil it down to node, and then you can add on the demand.

Combined, they make up less than 1% of the conglomerate's total assets."", ""But that doesn't mean the payment technology companies have been poor performers. It has been quite the opposite situation, actually. The two financial stocks have soared over the last decade, crushing the S&P 500 index's gain by wide margins."", ""There's no question that Visa and Mastercard have both been phenomenal for their shareholders. But is there a better Warren Buffett stock that investors should consider buying right now?"", 'There is no shortage of compelling reasons to appreciate the two credit card payment giants. For starters, both Visa and Mastercard have historically posted a steady revenue and earnings growth. Even in uncertain macroeconomic times, like what the world has been in for the past few years, these businesses continue to report impressive financial results.', ""They are both incredibly profitable. During the last three months of 2023, Visa and Mastercard's operating margins came in at 69% and 52%, respectively. Such bottom-line strength allows them to pay dividends and buy back lots of stock."", ""I'd also point to their wide economic moats. Thanks to their enormous two-sided payments platforms that merchants and consumers have heavily adopted globally, both companies benefit from powerful network effects. Consequently, their competitive positions are virtually unassailable."", ""It's no wonder they both have made for fantastic investments."", 'It would be hard for anyone to question the idea that Visa and Mastercard are truly great companies. But some investors might balk at their above-average valuations. At the moment, shares of Visa and Mastercard trade at nearly 29 and 33 times forward earnings, respectively.\xa0', ""Meanwhile, take a peek at Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio, and you'll notice that another large payments enterprise is a top holding: American Express (NYSE: AXP). And it should be on your radar."", 'Like Visa and Mastercard, Amex also operates a two-sided payments platform. This means that it, too, benefits from network effects. There are 80 million merchant locations in 200 countries that accept Amex as a method of payment. And as of Dec. 31, it had 141 million active cards in circulation that helped drive $434 billion of transaction volume in the last three months of 2023.', 'But unlike Visa and Mastercard, American Express is also a card issuer. It finds and underwrites borrowers, takes on credit risk, handles ongoing payments, and offers perks and rewards to cardholders.', ""So, not only does Amex earn significant amounts of interest income, which represented 22% of total revenue (net of interest expense) in 2023, but the business collects what's called discount revenue directly from merchants who plug into its network. Amex makes more money from every transaction that runs across its system."", 'Because American Express typically targets a higher-income consumer, its default rates are lower\xa0than those of its banking peers. This points to the status of its well-known brand, and helps reduce its financial risk.', 'In Q4, the company reported revenue growth (net of interest expense) of 11% and diluted earnings per share growth of 27%. Management expects double-digit percentage gains again this year.', ""As of this writing, its shares trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 17.3. That's a much cheaper valuation than Visa and Mastercard. But it's justified because Amex operates more like a traditional bank."", ""Given the substantial stake Berkshire Hathaway holds in American Express (about 21%), Buffett and his investment team clearly view it as the best stock to own of these three. But I don't see any problem with buying and holding all of them. They could all be long-term winners."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in American Express right now?', 'Before you buy stock in American Express, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and American Express wasn’t one of them.

And when a renowned expert in their field speaks, people tend to both listen and follow their moves.', ""The latter has often been the case with Warren Buffett, who many people consider the greatest investor of his time. Amassing a net worth of more than $130 billion and making Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) an $850 billion-plus company (with the help of his partners along the way, of course), it's easy to see why investors would look to Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway's moves to get some investment inspiration."", 'These three stocks are good options if you have $1,000 available to invest. Dividing the $1,000 between them will give investors exposure to consistent income and growth opportunities.', ""Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) has been one of Berkshire Hathaway's longest-standing investments, having bought its first stake in 1988. Berkshire Hathaway now owns 400 million Coca-Cola shares, representing over a 9% stake in the beverage giant."", ""Buffett likes Coca-Cola because of its competitive advantage, which is its brand power and distribution reach. Coca-Cola is one of the most recognizable brands in the world, and you could argue that its flagship Coca-Cola soda is the most recognizable consumer good worldwide. Coca-Cola is sold in more than 200 countries, and the company even notes that many entrepreneurs import it from neighboring countries to sell in places where it's not officially manufactured."", ""This vast distribution network has been the catalyst for the company's robust financials, and its focus on beverages (unlike its biggest competitor, PepsiCo, which also sells snacks) has allowed Coca-Cola to operate more efficiently. In their latest respective quarters, Coca-Cola's net income was higher than PepsiCo's, while its revenue was more than almost half of it."", ""Coca-Cola's position as the market leader gives it a strong foothold for lasting longevity. It's a blue-chip stock that can be productive in investors' portfolios for the long haul."", ""American Express (NYSE: AXP) (Amex) is Berkshire Hathaway's third-largest holding, with a more than 20% stake in the credit card company."", 'Amex has a unique business model that differs from competitors like Visa (NYSE: V) and Mastercard. Neither Visa nor Mastercard issues their own cards or lend directly to consumers. They operate the payment network and play middleman between financial institutions and consumers. On the other hand, Amex issues its own cards and operates its payment network.', ""Amex's business model allows it to earn revenue from cardholder fees, transaction fees, and interest on consumer balances. It's proved lucrative, too. Since a revenue drop caused primarily by the COVID-19 pandemic, Amex's revenue has been on an impressive upward trajectory."", ""Amex's enticing rewards programs have positioned it uniquely in the credit card industry. The programs attract high-spending customers and people seeking premium perks, allowing the company to charge annual fees of up to $695. These programs also create loyalty with their customers, which has helped build Amex into the premium brand it's considered today."", ""That brand equity can't (and likely won't) be easily replicated."", ""Visa is another Buffett stock that thrives because of its competitive advantage. In Visa's case, its competitive advantage is its reach. Visa has more than 4.3 billion cards in circulation, with over 130 million merchant locations. That's far more than any of its competitors."", ""Visa's position as the top card issuer allows it to greatly benefit from the network effect. Few places that accept cards don't accept Visa, incentivizing consumers to go with the company. On the merchant's end, knowing Visa is the most common card incentivizes them to accept Visa, because not doing so could exclude many potential customers."", ""This reach didn't happen overnight, either. It's the by-product of decades of investments and strategic partnerships. All of these factors allow the company to operate with high gross profit margins that not many companies can compete with."", 'As digital payments become more common and widespread, Visa should continue to expand its reach and lead the charge for credit card companies -- especially as it continues to develop technologies to stay ahead of the curve.', ""It's a stock I'd hold on to for the long run without thinking twice."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

(NYSE:AXP) to be fairly valued after the recent surge of over 58% from its October 2023 lows. American Express is a great company that Buffett has owned for decades. Its ROIC consistently exceeds its WACC.', 'Founded in 1850, American Express is known principally for its charge cards but also extends credit and provides a suite of related services to businesses and merchants. The company is positioned at the higher end of the card business. Despite the competitive nature of the industry, it has averaged about 10% earnings per share growth over many years, through above-average revenue growth and ongoing share buybacks.', 'Overall, I think American Express is a weak buy if you do not already own it. If you own it, I think it is best to wait for a more opportunistic entry point to buy more. It is a proven compounder of shareholder capital and though right now its not a bargain, buying it now is unlikely to cause regret in the future. However, be aware that the best opportunity to buy American Express happens when the fear of a recession is in the air like last year. With a booming economy like at present, American Express is on the expensive side. Berkshire owns more than 20% of its stock.', 'Buffett said, ""The lesson from Coke and AMEX? When you find a truly wonderful business, stick with it. Patience pays, and one wonderful business can offset the many mediocre decisions that are inevitable.""', ""Berkshire owns 27.80% of Occidental Petroleum Corp. (NYSE:OXY) shares as well as holds options to increase its stake further, but Buffett emphasized that he has no desire to own the company outright. The guru likes Occidental's vast oil and gas holdings in the United States, as well as its leadership in carbon-capture initiatives, though the economic feasibility of the latter technique has yet to be proven. However, clearly it will be needed in the future due to the inevitability of climate change and societal pressure to do something about it. Both of these activities, he said, are very much in the country's interest, giving the investment a patriotic flavor. Buffett likes the fact that Occidental's holdings are in the U.S. (thus safe from a geopolitical turbulence) and very much needed to maintain U.S. energy independence from foreign oil, which he sees as a risk to the country. Thus, his holdings in Occidental somewhat of a hedge against global conflict and turbulence."", 'Occidental looks modestly overvalued according to the GF Value Line. However, I think we should look at the stock from the lens Buffett is using that it is a domestic oil and gas major, and thus much safer than other large multinational oil and gas companies with comparable reserves outside the U.S. Further, like all oil and gas companies, it is very cyclical.', 'Buffett is a multibillionaire and is not bothered by volatility. However, most investors are not multibillionaires, so factor that in. All in all, I would wait for a better entry point.', ""Berkshire currently holds approximately 9% ownership in each of five Japanese companies. Buffett said in his letter that Berkshire has made a commitment to these companies that it will not acquire shares exceeding a 9.90% stake. The total cost of these holdings amounts to 1.60 trillion yen ($10.75 billion), while the year-end market value stands at 2.90 trillion yen. However, due to the yen's recent weakening, Berkshire's unrealized gain in dollars reached 61%, equivalent to $8 billion."", 'These companies are often referred to as Sogo-Shosha, which translates to ""general trading companies,"" and form a crucial part of the Japanese economy. However, they have greatly evolved from their trading roots and are now conglomerates of many trading, real estate and industrial businesses.', 'The first is Itochu Corp. (TSE:8001), a diversified conglomerate with interests spanning various sectors. Historically, it played a crucial role in importing energy, minerals and food into Japan. Today, its portfolio extends beyond trade activities to include logistics, real estate, frozen foods and even investments in electric vehicles and renewable energy.', ""Next is Marubeni Corp. (TSE:8002), another significant player in Japan's trading landscape. Like its peers, it has a diverse portfolio, including energy, agriculture and infrastructure. The company has adapted to changing market dynamics and expanded into non-trade areas such as real estate and aerospace."", ""Third, Mitsubishi Corp. (TSE:8058) has a rich history and has been instrumental in Japan's economic development. Traditionally, it focused on importing raw materials and exporting finished products. Today, the company's interests span various industries, including automotive, machinery and finance. It has also ventured into newer areas like EVs and renewable energy."", ""Mitsui & Co. Ltd. (TSE:8031) is one of the oldest sogo-shosha companies, with its roots tracing back to the Edo period. Over time, it has diversified its business lines, including investments in infrastructure, chemicals and health care. Mitsui's very long-term approach aligns with Buffett's investment philosophy."", ""Last but not least is Sumitomo Corp. (TSE:8053). It has a storied history dating back centuries. The company has been involved in copper mining, banking and trade. In recent years, Sumitomo has expanded into diverse sectors, such as real estate, logistics and telecommunications. Its focus on value and cash flow resonates with Buffett's investment principles."", 'The table below provides a snapshot of these companies basic fundamentals:', 'Ticker', 'Company', 'Current Price (Yen)', 'Market Cap', '($M)', 'EV-to-', 'EBITDA', 'PE Ratio', 'FCF Yield %', 'Dividend', 'Yield %', 'TSE:8001', 'Itochu Corp', '6,385', '62,439.73', '8.32', '12.71', '7.86', '2.43', 'TSE:8031', 'Mitsui & Co Ltd', '6,522', '66,234.07', '7.41', '9.75', '8.75', '2.45', 'TSE:8058', 'Mitsubishi Corp', '3,235', '90,633.05', '8.53', '14.95', '7.47', '2.14', 'TSE:8053', 'Sumitomo Corp', '3,462', '28,690.40', '7.92', '8.42', '9.93', '3.47', 'TSE:8002', 'Marubeni Corp', '2,434', '27,650.44', '7.24', '9.14', '8.07', '3.37', 'Since Buffett purchased the five companies about three years ago, they are up substantially in yen terms and even more in U.S. dollar terms as the yen has weakened. The following chart shows the price appreciation over the last three years.', ""While the five companies may not be household names globally, they play critical roles in Japan's economic landscape, which is similar to the role Berkshire plays in the U.S. Buffett's interest in these Japanese companies reflects their stability, diversified portfolios and long-term vision. He appreciates their similarities to Berkshire Hathaway, emphasizing value and understanding the businesses they operate."", 'Buffett said in his letter that because he cannot accurately forecast major currency market prices, Berkshire had financed a significant portion of its Japanese stock position using the proceeds from 1.30 trillion yen in bond sales. This debt issue has been well-received in Japan, and Berkshire likely holds more yen-denominated debt than any other American company. The weakened yen since then has resulted in a year-end gain of $1.90 billion for Berkshire, which, in accordance with GAAP rules, has been recognized in income over the 2020 to 2023 period. Thus, not only have the stock prices of the Japanese companies gone up substantially, but the debt Berkshire took on has diminished in U.S. dollar terms, resulting in a one-two punch in favor of Berkshire.', 'Buffett said in his letter that all five Japanese companies adhere to shareholder-friendly policies that surpass typical U.S. practices. Since Berkshire initiated its purchases, each of these companies has reduced their outstanding shares at attractive prices. Additionally, he says, their management teams exhibit ""less aggressiveness"" regarding compensating themselves compared to U.S. norms. Furthermore, each allocates only about one-third of its earnings to dividends, retaining substantial sums for business expansion and share repurchases. Like Berkshire, these companies are cautious about issuing new shares. From the tone of the letter, it looks like Buffett is really pleased with his ownership of the Japanese sogo-soshas and are companies he intends to hold indefinitely.', ""Buffett had surprisingly little to say about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in his letter, given the extremely large part of Berkshire's portfolio invested in the stock. Apple now constitutes over 50% of Berkshire's non-controlled equity investment portfolio. It own 5.86% of Apple's outstanding shares."", ""The tech giant looks fairly valued on the GF Value Line. I don't think we can go wrong with Apple at the present time given its dominance in mobile tech and wide competitive moat."", ""Another stock is Bank of America Corp. (NYSE:BAC), which is Buffett's second-highest conviction stock after Apple and over 10% of his portfolio is in it. Berkshire owns about 13% of the bank's outstanding stock. It is also in fairly valued territory."", 'So that\'s it folks. These are Buffett\'s ""indefinite hold"" or ""close enough to forever"" stocks gleaned from his latest letter. At present, I think only Coca-Cola is a clear buy and the rest are weak buys. I like Apple and if it comes down a bit more, I may take the plunge.', ""Buffett's Japanese investments are very interesting, but I would rather hold them indirectly through my ownership of Berkshire stock to avoid the foreign exchange risk. The purchase of the five conglomerates was a master stroke. It is interesting to note that while Buffett has been building up his Japanese exposure, he has been reducing his Chinese and Taiwanese exposure. He has been selling down his BYD (SZSE:002594) position and has exited his Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) position. While he did not disclose a reason, I think it may be because of geopolitical concerns."", ""The guru's approach is pretty much safety first and very long-term thinking. Watching his portfolio is like watching paint dry. Like he says, the first rule of investing is not to lose money and the second rule is to see the first rule. It is very interesting to see this philosophy in action with his biggest holdings."", 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

Of the 11 broad sectors of the market’s benchmark — the S&P 500 Index — the Utility sector declined more than 11%. Investors’ preference shifted to growth stocks from defensive sectors like utility as the Fed significantly reduced the magnitude of interest rate hikes.', 'However, the utility sector is likely to regain momentum in 2024. Last week, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell gave his testimony before the Senate after appearing before the House of Representatives a day before.', 'On Mar 6, Powell said the central bank is likely to initiate interest rate cuts this year but not any time soon.

Moreover, the sector is known for the stability and visibility of its earnings and cash flows.\xa0 Stable earnings enable utilities to pay out consistent dividends that make them more attractive to income-oriented investors.', 'Utility companies enjoy a reputation for being safe, given the regulated nature of their business.

While both strategies aim to enhance value for investors, they follow distinct paths. The primary distinction lies in the pricing. Growth stocks tend to be pricier, with high valuations relative to their sales or earnings. Conversely, value stocks are more affordable, with lower stock prices in comparison to their sales or earnings. Over time, both growth and value investment approaches have demonstrated comparable performance, yet historical analysis indicates that value investing has been more advantageous for investors in the long term. According to research published by Josef Lakonishok, Andrei Shleifer, and Robert W. Vishny in the Journal of Finance, value strategies tend to yield superior returns. Various investment strategies centered around purchasing undervalued stocks have consistently outperformed those focused on trendy or high-flying stocks from April 1968 to April 1990.', 'The research paper also emphasized that value stocks typically offer significantly higher dividend yields and possess stronger fundamental ratios compared to growth stocks. Both Josef Lakonishok and the value investing expert David Dreman have observed that value investing outperforms growth investing approximately 70% of the time, regardless of the size of the companies involved. Their studies, which encompassed various company sizes, revealed that value stocks consistently delivered average returns of slightly over 7% per year higher than growth stocks over extended periods.', 'As mentioned earlier, dividends are often a key component of value stocks. Among dividend strategies, one of the most popular approaches is investing in dividend aristocrats. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index tracks the performance of companies within the S&P 500 that have consistently increased their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. A report from S&P Dow Jones Indices indicated that strategies focusing on generating income often exhibit significant value characteristics. Investors typically gravitate towards securities offering high dividend yields and lower price multiples. The report also mentioned that the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index demonstrated a blend of both growth and value traits, rather than a pronounced bias towards one style. Analysis of the index composition from 1999 to 2022 revealed its style breakdown. On average, the index maintained a 59.04% exposure to value stocks and a 40.94% exposure to growth stocks during this period.', 'Despite the allure of high-priced growth stocks, value stocks have consistently proven to be advantageous for investors over the long haul. Dimensional Funds conducted an analysis spanning nearly a century, affirming that value stocks typically offer higher expected returns. While there have been occasional downturns, the fundamental principle that lower relative prices correlate with higher expected returns remains steadfast. Value premiums have often manifested swiftly and significantly. For instance, in years when value outperformed growth, the average premium amounted to nearly 15%. On average, in the US, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks by 4.4% annually from 1927 to 2022.', ""Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Emerson Electric Co.

She further notes that CrownRock\'s inventory ""helps to improve"" Oxy\'s own, and this synergy helps to accelerate cash flow generation, which she describes as ""an acceleration of value"" for shareholders. In the near term, the company is focusing on paying down debt and eventually resume repurchasing shares.', 'She highlights that the company has maintained ""a very healthy repurchase program"" due to the stock being ""very undervalued.""', 'Regarding Oxy\'s carbon emission initiatives, Hollub stresses the company\'s familiarity with the gas, stating: ""We know how CO2 works."" She underlines Occidental Petroleum\'s existing infrastructure for handling carbon dioxide emissions and the ""difficult process"" involved in convincing sites to install carbon capture equipment. However, Hollub notes that the carbon engineering technology, which allows the extraction of carbon from the atmosphere, was ""a holy grail"" for Occidental. This technology empowers the company to ""control our own destiny"" by bypassing the need for emitters.', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith"", 'JULIE HYMAN: Plot of acquisition activity in the oil and gas industry as of late, especially when it comes to large oil companies acquiring more shale. An example of that Occidental agreeing to buy CrownRock for $10.8 billion. In equity, $12 billion total value.', ""I'm here now at the CERAWeek by S&P Global conference with Vicki Hollub, the CEO of Occidental. Thanks so much for being here."", 'VICKI HOLLUB: Thank you. Happy to be here.', 'JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, I want to talk about this acquisition, first of all. You all acquiring CrownRock. It was announced back in December.', ""And of course, you're not the only one. We've seen this spate of acquisitions in the industry. What is this all about? What is the goal here in acquiring CrownRock?"", ""VICKI HOLLUB: I think every company has their own set of goals for us. In the Permian Basin, we had a very large position in the Delaware. And that position was gave us the scale we need to bring the efficiencies of not just the proximity, but the size of what we're doing there."", 'So Delaware basin was fine. We wanted to apply the same model to the Midland basin. But we had a position that was pretty small in the Midland', 'Basin. So acquiring CrownRock gives us a little more scale. The scale also is in the right position. So it was a perfect fit with the assets that we already had.', 'And in addition, it brought with it an inventory. That actually helps to improve our inventory by fitting into tier one of the prospects that we have to drill in the future. So that was important.', ""And the other thing is it does bring forward cash flow. So part of the way we'll pay for some of the acquisition is to sell some of our oil and gas areas that are further out in terms of development and time. So this is an acceleration of value to our shareholders, improving our inventory, giving us the opportunity to become much more efficient in the Midland."", 'JULIE HYMAN: And how is the timeline looking for selling off those assets that you mentioned to help fund this transaction?', ""VICKI HOLLUB: Yeah, we expect to meet our timeline that we laid out. And that's 12 months past timeline for the initial phase. And then by 18 months, we'll have everything that we need to finalize what we want to do with the acquisition."", ""JULIE HYMAN: And should investors think of this. I mean, when you talk about scale, you're not just talking about scale, you're also talking about efficiency, you're talking about profitability of these various shale areas. So should investors think of this as a 1 plus 1 equals 2, or some exponential exponent of that?"", ""VICKI HOLLUB: It'll be 1 plus 1 equals more than 2. Because with what we'll be able to do with the efficiencies that we create will create more value not only from that particular development, but again, it's the acceleration of value to the shareholders that from an NPV basis is much better."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Now, I talked to one analyst after this transaction who talked about wondering if this is a sign Occidental is moving a little bit back towards a low shareholder return phase. And he was wondering when you'll get back to a sort of higher shareholder return phase. Can you talk to us about how you're thinking about that?"", ""VICKI HOLLUB: If the shareholder return that he's talking about is buybacks, then yes, we will in the near-term over the next couple of years, we'll continue to pay debt down. Post those two years, we'll get back to repurchasing shares. We've had a very healthy repurchase program over the last couple of years because of the fact that our stock right now is very undervalued in our view."", 'And so we think that the two important ways to return value to shareholders are through a growing dividend, which the CrownRock acquisition does for us and to repurchase shares. But also, we get a really good return on capital employed by investing organically in our oil and gas development. So those three things are the way that we can continue to create value for our shareholders.', 'JULIE HYMAN: I want to talk about another big project that you all are working on. And this is on the energy transition front direct air capture, which is effectively pulling CO2 out of the air and trying to bury it underground sequestering it. This is something that I believe Occidental fairly uniquely is doing in the oil and gas business.', ""Why did you decide to go that route versus capturing the CO2 that comes from the oil and gas processes? And what's the long-term outlook for this?"", ""VICKI HOLLUB: Well we've actually been using CO2 for enhanced oil recovery for more than 50 years. And so that's a core competence of us. We know how CO2 works."", 'We know how to manage it. We know how to deal with it. We have the infrastructure for it in the Permian Basin.', ""And so for a long time, we were trying to capture anthropogenic CO2 from industry. But that's a difficult process. Because when you're trying to get an industrial site to commit, to putting retrofitting equipment on their facility to capture carbon, that's not an easy negotiation. It's not an easy agreement to get to."", ""And quite frankly, we started back in 2008 trying to make that happen. We couldn't make it happen with anybody. And then we came across this Carbon Engineering technology to extract CO2 out of the atmosphere."", ""When we found that technology, that was more like the Holy Grail for us, because now we didn't have to talk to any emitters. All we had to do, and we controlled our own destiny with our schedule in terms of what pace we could develop these at and how well we could develop the direct air capture. And that allows us to do it when and where it makes sense to do."", ""And the other thing about that technology is that just so happens that it's potassium hydroxide that will extract the CO2 out of the air. We're the largest marketer of potassium hydroxide in the US, second largest in the world. And to make the mixing happen in the contact tower so that you get the most efficiency and pull the most CO2 out of the air."", 'You have to have the mixing happen in a good way. And PVC will help that will be the diffuser in the tower. And we make PVC, too. So not only did we have the synergy with our oil and gas business of having used CO2 in enhanced oil recovery, but also the synergies with the infrastructure that we have as a result of that and then the synergies with chemicals. And it was like this was meant for us to do.', ""JULIE HYMAN: When is it going to make money? What's the timeline? Because it's the economics of it. And not just with direct air capture, but with your rivals are doing. It's quite difficult."", ""VICKI HOLLUB: Actually, we will have the first phase of Stratus which is our direct air capture facility that we're building in the Permian. That will be up starting up in mid next year. We've already sold about 70% of the carbon reduction credits for that 500,000 tons per year that will ultimately have for that facility. And that's been going well."", 'There is a demand from airlines, from tech companies, and even from a consulting company and some others that want to reduce their carbon footprint. This is the voluntary compliance market. These are people who care about their carbon footprint, and who want to make a difference, want to offset that carbon footprint.', ""They're buying these credits. So we will have cash flow coming in from that facility."", 'JULIE HYMAN: When do you think it will pay for itself and actually get into the black?', ""VICKI HOLLUB: The payout really is dependent on what the credits are beyond what we've sold out today. We've done a really good job. And so we haven't sold them all."", ""But the cost of credits right now are going up because there's a limited number of reduction credits that companies can buy. So I hope to be able to tell you in two years exactly what that looks like. But it's evolving."", ""JULIE HYMAN: We'll check back in with you."", ""VICKI HOLLUB: It's evolving and going well actually."", 'JULIE HYMAN: Vicki Hollub, thanks so much. Really appreciate your time here.', 'VICKI HOLLUB: Thank you.']"

Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value.

A year later, Coca-Cola made a major change when it took out Sprite bottles’ green PET, which was an additive that was difficult to recycle into new bottles. That forced its iconic packaging to be changed from green to clear.', 'Coca-Cola (KO) estimates that the new bottles will reduce 83 million pounds of plastic used in its US supply change, the equivalent of two billion bottles, Ritter said, calling the changes “significant.”', 'Customers will notice a new label signifying the change, although the bottle itself won’t look or feel too different from the packaging currently sold. However, the label and caps will not be made from 100% recycled plastic.', 'Companies like Coca-Cola have been making more environmentally packaging as consumer awareness and demand for action has intensified in recent years. But Ritter acknowledged that it’s too early to judge if the new bottles are “resulting in measurable sales change.” Coca-Cola’s most recent earnings show that North American volume fell 1% due to weakening demand for its sports drinks and coffee.', 'The company aims to complete the rollout nationwide by the end of the summer.

What\'s needed is a sound intellectual framework for making decisions and the ability to keep emotions from corroding that framework."" - Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)', 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with PRGO.', 'In his recent letter to Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) shareholders, Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) identified three stocks as well as five Japanese companies which the conglomerate intends to hold ""indefinitely."" This is close enough to ""forever"" as far as I am concerned for the purpose of this discussion. The reason is these companies are hugely successful in their base businesses, are enduring, scalable and leave him feeling ""comfortable."" The last point is an important if underappreciated quality in choosing stocks to own. You want to avoid investments that cause you stress and keep you up at night. This discussion explores these Buffett ""forever"" stocks using GuruFocus data and I offer my opinion if they are still worth buying at current prices.', 'Additionally, as he recalled Charlie Munger advising him, after he took control of Berkshire and relocated it from New England to Omaha, that he should forget about ""owning fair stocks at wonderful prices,"" but focus on ""owning wonderful stocks at fair prices."" I think we can be certain these businesses are wonderful as Berkshire owns them, but are the prices still ""fair?"" And if so, does it make sense to still buy them?', ""The first company Buffett identified is Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE:KO). GuruFocus data shows the stock to be modestly undervalued and fits with Munger's definition of a wonderful business at a fair price."", 'Buffett mentioned in his letter that Coca-Cola was launched in an Atlanta drug store in 1886, quipping that Berkshire is not big on newcomers.', ""Coca-Cola is a business with high predictability and low capital intensity. It is global in its scope. People are used to drinking its products and are expected to keep on consuming them for decades to come. Drinking carbonated beverages is unlikely to go out of fashion. Technological disruptions such as artificial intelligence do not fundamentally threaten the business, but can enhance it. The company's return on invested capital consistently exceeds its weighted average cost of capital. Berkshire owns about 9% of Coke's outstanding shares."", 'Overall, I think Coca-Cola is still a buy. It is a ""sleep well at night"" stock that will continue compounding in the future.', 'The GF Value chart shows American Express Co. (NYSE:AXP) to be fairly valued after the recent surge of over 58% from its October 2023 lows. American Express is a great company that Buffett has owned for decades. Its ROIC consistently exceeds its WACC.', 'Founded in 1850, American Express is known principally for its charge cards but also extends credit and provides a suite of related services to businesses and merchants. The company is positioned at the higher end of the card business. Despite the competitive nature of the industry, it has averaged about 10% earnings per share growth over many years, through above-average revenue growth and ongoing share buybacks.', 'Overall, I think American Express is a weak buy if you do not already own it. If you own it, I think it is best to wait for a more opportunistic entry point to buy more. It is a proven compounder of shareholder capital and though right now its not a bargain, buying it now is unlikely to cause regret in the future. However, be aware that the best opportunity to buy American Express happens when the fear of a recession is in the air like last year. With a booming economy like at present, American Express is on the expensive side. Berkshire owns more than 20% of its stock.', 'Buffett said, ""The lesson from Coke and AMEX? When you find a truly wonderful business, stick with it. Patience pays, and one wonderful business can offset the many mediocre decisions that are inevitable.""', ""Berkshire owns 27.80% of Occidental Petroleum Corp. (NYSE:OXY) shares as well as holds options to increase its stake further, but Buffett emphasized that he has no desire to own the company outright. The guru likes Occidental's vast oil and gas holdings in the United States, as well as its leadership in carbon-capture initiatives, though the economic feasibility of the latter technique has yet to be proven. However, clearly it will be needed in the future due to the inevitability of climate change and societal pressure to do something about it. Both of these activities, he said, are very much in the country's interest, giving the investment a patriotic flavor. Buffett likes the fact that Occidental's holdings are in the U.S. (thus safe from a geopolitical turbulence) and very much needed to maintain U.S. energy independence from foreign oil, which he sees as a risk to the country. Thus, his holdings in Occidental somewhat of a hedge against global conflict and turbulence."", 'Occidental looks modestly overvalued according to the GF Value Line. However, I think we should look at the stock from the lens Buffett is using that it is a domestic oil and gas major, and thus much safer than other large multinational oil and gas companies with comparable reserves outside the U.S. Further, like all oil and gas companies, it is very cyclical.', 'Buffett is a multibillionaire and is not bothered by volatility. However, most investors are not multibillionaires, so factor that in. All in all, I would wait for a better entry point.', ""Berkshire currently holds approximately 9% ownership in each of five Japanese companies. Buffett said in his letter that Berkshire has made a commitment to these companies that it will not acquire shares exceeding a 9.90% stake. The total cost of these holdings amounts to 1.60 trillion yen ($10.75 billion), while the year-end market value stands at 2.90 trillion yen. However, due to the yen's recent weakening, Berkshire's unrealized gain in dollars reached 61%, equivalent to $8 billion."", 'These companies are often referred to as Sogo-Shosha, which translates to ""general trading companies,"" and form a crucial part of the Japanese economy. However, they have greatly evolved from their trading roots and are now conglomerates of many trading, real estate and industrial businesses.', 'The first is Itochu Corp. (TSE:8001), a diversified conglomerate with interests spanning various sectors. Historically, it played a crucial role in importing energy, minerals and food into Japan. Today, its portfolio extends beyond trade activities to include logistics, real estate, frozen foods and even investments in electric vehicles and renewable energy.', ""Next is Marubeni Corp. (TSE:8002), another significant player in Japan's trading landscape. Like its peers, it has a diverse portfolio, including energy, agriculture and infrastructure. The company has adapted to changing market dynamics and expanded into non-trade areas such as real estate and aerospace."", ""Third, Mitsubishi Corp. (TSE:8058) has a rich history and has been instrumental in Japan's economic development. Traditionally, it focused on importing raw materials and exporting finished products. Today, the company's interests span various industries, including automotive, machinery and finance. It has also ventured into newer areas like EVs and renewable energy."", ""Mitsui & Co. Ltd.

Over time, it has diversified its business lines, including investments in infrastructure, chemicals and health care. Mitsui's very long-term approach aligns with Buffett's investment philosophy."", ""Last but not least is Sumitomo Corp. (TSE:8053). It has a storied history dating back centuries. The company has been involved in copper mining, banking and trade. In recent years, Sumitomo has expanded into diverse sectors, such as real estate, logistics and telecommunications. Its focus on value and cash flow resonates with Buffett's investment principles."", 'The table below provides a snapshot of these companies basic fundamentals:', 'Ticker', 'Company', 'Current Price (Yen)', 'Market Cap', '($M)', 'EV-to-', 'EBITDA', 'PE Ratio', 'FCF Yield %', 'Dividend', 'Yield %', 'TSE:8001', 'Itochu Corp', '6,385', '62,439.73', '8.32', '12.71', '7.86', '2.43', 'TSE:8031', 'Mitsui & Co Ltd', '6,522', '66,234.07', '7.41', '9.75', '8.75', '2.45', 'TSE:8058', 'Mitsubishi Corp', '3,235', '90,633.05', '8.53', '14.95', '7.47', '2.14', 'TSE:8053', 'Sumitomo Corp', '3,462', '28,690.40', '7.92', '8.42', '9.93', '3.47', 'TSE:8002', 'Marubeni Corp', '2,434', '27,650.44', '7.24', '9.14', '8.07', '3.37', 'Since Buffett purchased the five companies about three years ago, they are up substantially in yen terms and even more in U.S. dollar terms as the yen has weakened. The following chart shows the price appreciation over the last three years.', ""While the five companies may not be household names globally, they play critical roles in Japan's economic landscape, which is similar to the role Berkshire plays in the U.S. Buffett's interest in these Japanese companies reflects their stability, diversified portfolios and long-term vision. He appreciates their similarities to Berkshire Hathaway, emphasizing value and understanding the businesses they operate."", 'Buffett said in his letter that because he cannot accurately forecast major currency market prices, Berkshire had financed a significant portion of its Japanese stock position using the proceeds from 1.30 trillion yen in bond sales. This debt issue has been well-received in Japan, and Berkshire likely holds more yen-denominated debt than any other American company. The weakened yen since then has resulted in a year-end gain of $1.90 billion for Berkshire, which, in accordance with GAAP rules, has been recognized in income over the 2020 to 2023 period. Thus, not only have the stock prices of the Japanese companies gone up substantially, but the debt Berkshire took on has diminished in U.S. dollar terms, resulting in a one-two punch in favor of Berkshire.', 'Buffett said in his letter that all five Japanese companies adhere to shareholder-friendly policies that surpass typical U.S. practices. Since Berkshire initiated its purchases, each of these companies has reduced their outstanding shares at attractive prices. Additionally, he says, their management teams exhibit ""less aggressiveness"" regarding compensating themselves compared to U.S. norms. Furthermore, each allocates only about one-third of its earnings to dividends, retaining substantial sums for business expansion and share repurchases. Like Berkshire, these companies are cautious about issuing new shares. From the tone of the letter, it looks like Buffett is really pleased with his ownership of the Japanese sogo-soshas and are companies he intends to hold indefinitely.', ""Buffett had surprisingly little to say about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in his letter, given the extremely large part of Berkshire's portfolio invested in the stock. Apple now constitutes over 50% of Berkshire's non-controlled equity investment portfolio. It own 5.86% of Apple's outstanding shares."", ""The tech giant looks fairly valued on the GF Value Line. I don't think we can go wrong with Apple at the present time given its dominance in mobile tech and wide competitive moat."", ""Another stock is Bank of America Corp. (NYSE:BAC), which is Buffett's second-highest conviction stock after Apple and over 10% of his portfolio is in it. Berkshire owns about 13% of the bank's outstanding stock. It is also in fairly valued territory."", 'So that\'s it folks. These are Buffett\'s ""indefinite hold"" or ""close enough to forever"" stocks gleaned from his latest letter. At present, I think only Coca-Cola is a clear buy and the rest are weak buys. I like Apple and if it comes down a bit more, I may take the plunge.', ""Buffett's Japanese investments are very interesting, but I would rather hold them indirectly through my ownership of Berkshire stock to avoid the foreign exchange risk. The purchase of the five conglomerates was a master stroke. It is interesting to note that while Buffett has been building up his Japanese exposure, he has been reducing his Chinese and Taiwanese exposure. He has been selling down his BYD (SZSE:002594) position and has exited his Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) position. While he did not disclose a reason, I think it may be because of geopolitical concerns."", ""The guru's approach is pretty much safety first and very long-term thinking. Watching his portfolio is like watching paint dry. Like he says, the first rule of investing is not to lose money and the second rule is to see the first rule. It is very interesting to see this philosophy in action with his biggest holdings."", 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

(NASDAQ:INTU) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.', ""Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether."", ' See our latest analysis for Intuit ', ""In the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive VP and GM of Small Business & Self Employed Group, Marianna Tessel, sold US$4.8m worth of shares at a price of US$553 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$626). When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. It is worth noting that this sale was only 21% of Marianna Tessel's holding."", ""Intuit insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year.

In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain."", 'I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Intuit insiders own 2.8% of the company, currently worth about US$4.9b based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.', ""Insiders sold Intuit shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. But it is good to see that Intuit is growing earnings. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales.

Moreover, companies are increasingly focusing on reducing controllable costs and maximizing operating efficiency across business lines to generate higher earnings and cash flows. The industry players have also been experiencing a solid pricing environment across their product portfolios, thereby helping to boost margins.Fluctuation in Input Prices, Weather Woes & Shortage of Skilled Labors: The industry players are struggling with escalating material expenses, the shortage of skilled laborers and rising wage costs. The companies use electricity, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources. Hence, supply-related woes and significant fluctuations in the prices of these resources affect operating results. Also, businesses are exposed to weather-related risks affecting production schedules and profitability. Excessive rainfall, flooding or severe droughts jeopardize shipments and production.

If you want to see our discussion on the US and international economies, head directly to Diversified Stock Portfolio: 5 Sector ETFs and International ETFs To Buy.', ""In the beginning of 2023, investors were cautiously optimistic about inflation cooling down and anticipated interest rate cuts, while also keeping an eye out for signs of an economic recession and lower corporate earnings. However, the economy outperformed these expectations, driven by higher-than-expected consumer savings, increased fiscal spending, and looser financial conditions. This led to a 25% increase in the S&P 500 Index in 2023, bringing the benchmark close to its record high from January 2022. The enthusiastic market rally at the end of 2023 has resulted in overvalued stocks, particularly as investors were encouraged by the Federal Reserve's indication in December that rate cuts could be imminent.\xa0"", ""Looking ahead, Morgan Stanley’s Global Investment Committee suggests that investors should adopt a more cautious approach, as 2024 is more likely to be an average year for markets rather than another year of double-digit growth. Analysts are predicting 2024 US corporate earnings to be around $242 per share, assuming that companies will continue to expand their profit margins. However, this estimate may be overly optimistic, considering that US economic growth is expected to taper off from last year's rapid pace of about 7% to around 4% this year. This slowdown could lead to a decrease in sales volume and pricing power for companies. Additionally, corporations may have already realized the benefits of lower manufacturing costs and declining oil and raw material prices, which may not contribute as significantly to improved margins in the future. Morgan Stanley believes that 2024 should be a time for balance, both for investors' expectations and their portfolios."", 'Looking at the international landscape, economists predict that the European economy is poised for a year of transition after a turbulent 2023, with key challenges like high inflation and increasing interest rates expected to diminish. CNBC noted that despite the challenging economic conditions in the Eurozone, the pan-European Stoxx 600 stock index ended the year 12.6% higher, driven by optimism about potential monetary policy changes in 2024 by the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. Stock markets in Europe and globally have started 2024 on a more uncertain note, awaiting new data and signals from central banks. Global markets saw a rally in the final months of 2023, as bond yields retreated on hopes that the Fed and ECB would start cutting interest rates early in 2024. However, the ECB has not yet indicated any immediate easing of policy, despite market expectations for a rate cut in March. Jari Stehn, Chief European Economist at The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), commented:', '“While wage growth is still firm and the labour market remains resilient, we expect both to soften in 2024 and look for core inflation to reach 2% year-on-year in [the fourth quarter of 2024], much earlier than projected by the ECB. As a result, we see earlier and faster policy rate cuts than implied by the Governing Council’s recent communication.”', ""Moreover, the Chinese economy in 2023 faced challenges as it emerged from COVID lockdown. Initially, there was a surge in business activity, especially in the services sector. However, this boost was short-lived, and the property market's troubles intensified. The distress faced by Country Garden Services Holdings Company Limited, one of China's major private developers, had a ripple effect, shaking business and investor confidence. The property market woes spilled over into consumer sentiment and strained local government finances. To address these issues, policymakers took steps such as policy rate cuts and fiscal support. These measures helped soften the economic impact but did not lead to a significant uptick in economic activity. As we enter 2024, there are known challenges ahead, but uncertainty remains about the future. While policymakers have outlined their goals and plans, there are doubts about how these will be implemented and their effectiveness."", ""In South Asia, India's $4 trillion stock market is attracting significant investments from both domestic and foreign investors, positioning itself as a rapidly growing alternative to China. Despite concerns about overpriced shares, upcoming elections, and regulatory uncertainties, investors are showing confidence in India's market potential. The NSE Nifty 50 Index has surged by a third in the past months, with foreign inflows reaching $20 billion in 2023, according to India's national depository data. In 2024, India's appeal is increasing as global investors seek alternatives to Chinese markets. There is also growing anticipation that the national elections this year will result in Prime Minister Narendra Modi securing a third term, further bolstering investor confidence in India's economic prospects."", ""Similarly, the Japanese stock market had a remarkable 2023, with the Nikkei 225 Index posting its fastest gain in a decade, reaching its highest level since the end of Japan's bubble economy in 1989. The Tokyo Stock Price Index also saw a rise, marking its fourth-best annual performance since 2001 by mid-November 2023 in local currency terms. As per Forbes, the positive trend in Japanese equities is expected to continue in 2024, supported by favorable market conditions and regulatory environment, along with backing from influential investors. Despite global challenges such as high interest rates, sluggish economic growth, and persistent inflation, major institutional investors like BlackRock remain optimistic about Japan's prospects. BlackRock announced in September 2023 that it would increase its investment in the world's second-largest economy.

This surge is attributed to challenging market conditions, prompting companies, especially those in upstream, midstream, and oil field services, to pursue consolidation into 2024. Middle market firms are expected to be particularly active in this M&A wave, necessitating proactive positioning for strength in the cycle. Valuation will be a key consideration in these deals, given the varying deal types and conditions prevalent in the oil and gas ecosystem. Furthermore, energy companies are increasingly leveraging AI technologies, including machine learning, to tackle challenges and capitalize on opportunities in the evolving energy landscape. AI solutions find application in optimizing production processes, monitoring emissions, enhancing safety measures, and improving customer experiences.\xa0', ""According to Deloitte, the energy sector is currently undergoing substantial changes due to four major factors – geopolitical shifts, economic fluctuations like high interest rates and increasing materials costs, evolving regulations, and the rapid advancement of new technologies. These elements greatly influence the oil and gas industry, shaping its direction in the coming years. Despite these challenges, the global oil market has shown resilience, boosted by OPEC+'s cuts in output, which have driven Brent oil prices over $90 per barrel. Meanwhile, US Henry Hub natural gas prices have rebounded to $3.50 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) in early November 2023. These developments highlight the complex interactions between geopolitical tensions, supply and demand dynamics, and regulatory frameworks impacting energy markets worldwide. Despite disruptions, global oil demand is expected to continue growing, potentially surpassing 100 million barrels per day for the first time in history, with a projected increase of 2.3 million barrels per day in 2023. This optimistic outlook is echoed by strong growth in electric vehicle sales, which surged by over 35% in 2023, with one out of every seven cars sold being electric.\xa0"", ""In 2024, Deloitte anticipates a solid beginning for the oil and gas industry, buoyed by its financial strength and favorable oil prices, barring any further macroeconomic challenges. This financial stability is expected to enable companies to sustain disciplined capital programs and prioritize shareholder interests, with the global upstream industry projected to maintain its 2023 investment levels and generate significant free cash flows. However, the industry's continued financial robustness is likely to raise expectations among investors, regulators, and other stakeholders for greater progress in emissions reduction, increased investments in low-carbon energy sources, and improved shareholder returns. These heightened expectations are expected to drive O&G companies to intensify their efforts to reduce emissions and enhance economic performance."", 'Moreover, the International Energy Agency (IEA) reports significant expansion in global renewable electricity generation capacity, with a growth rate unprecedented in the past three decades.

China notably led the surge, commissioning as much solar PV capacity in 2023 as the entire world did in 2022, alongside a 66% increase in wind power additions. Europe, the United States, and Brazil also witnessed record-high growth in renewable capacity. This surge reflects the momentum generated by commitments made at the COP28 climate conference to triple global renewable capacity by 2030. The IEA forecasts global renewable power capacity to reach 7,300 GW by 2028, driven largely by solar PV and wind, surpassing coal as the largest source of global electricity generation by early 2025.

364,c8421a4b-9c56-364d-8d9e-a3eae774ab9a,VLO,2024-03-19,3 Oil Refining Stocks That Just Moved Into Record Territory,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-oil-refining-stocks-just-121900882.html,1710764340,STORY,"['PSX', 'VLO', 'MPC']","['Of late, the refining companies have been dominating headlines in the Oil/Energy space. On Friday, the stock prices of Valero Energy VLO, Marathon Petroleum MPC and Phillips 66 PSX climbed to their all-time highs of $166.10, $195.12 and $159.74, respectively. On the day, each of them saw their share price increase about 3%. This jump marks a year-to-date ascent of somewhere between 20% and 30% for the operators.', ""Obviously, the recent rise in oil prices has played a key role in the abovementioned companies' surge. That's a big boon for VLO, MPC and PSX, given that it drives prices at the pumps.During the past week, crude oil surged to its highest levels in four months, surpassing $81 per barrel. This upward momentum was driven by significant decreases in U.S. crude and gasoline inventories, along with an optimistic demand projection from the International Energy Agency (“IEA”). Additionally, ongoing production cuts by OPEC and its allies, coupled with drone attacks on Russian energy facilities in Ukraine, bolstered crude prices.The IEA revised its forecast for oil demand growth upward for the current year and predicted a slight supply deficit through 2024, contrary to earlier expectations of a surplus. In its monthly report, the IEA raised its estimate for crude oil demand growth in 2024 by 110,000 barrels per day (bbl/day) to 1.3 million bbl/day, citing a stronger outlook for the U.S. market and increased fuel demand in shipping due to longer routes taken to avoid Red Sea conflicts. The agency also lowered its supply forecast for non-OPEC countries.Escalating attacks on Russian energy infrastructure and persistent uncertainty surrounding the Israel-Palestine conflict were additional factors contributing to the uptick in oil prices. Furthermore, a positive development was the Energy Information Administration's (‘EIA’) report, which revealed the first decline in U.S. crude inventories in seven weeks, accompanied by a significant drop in gasoline inventories. Prior to this, oil prices had been rising following Saudi Arabia's agreement with OPEC+ partners earlier in the month to extend production cuts of around 2 million bbl/day until mid-year.The downstream operators also benefited from the surge in gasoline prices, as U.S. refiners completed planned maintenance activities. As a result, domestic refinery utilization rates remained below 87% for eight consecutive weeks, marking the longest period of such low utilization in three years."", 'Continuing the ascension of of Valero Energy, Marathon Petroleum and Phillips 66 shares were their favorable fourth-quarter results that widely surpassed the bottom-line expectations during the period.VLO’s Q4 earnings of $3.55 per share breezed past the Zacks Consensus of $2.95 a share by 20%. Similarly, MPC easily surpassed Q4 earnings expectations with EPS at $3.98 per share and 69% above estimates of $2.36 a share. Meanwhile, quarterly EPS of $3.09 topped estimates by 30%.VLO, MPC and PSX stocks are part of the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining & Marketing industry group, which ranks in the top 30% out of more than 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. This group has widely outperformed the market over the last three years.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'By all accounts, the refining and marketing companies appear to be favorably positioned in the near future. The overall macro environment remains constructive, with steady demand for its products and enough cash flow visibility. At the same time, inflationary concerns have started to resurface and some of these companies could still experience stalling growth associated with broader economic headwinds. Therefore, it would be prudent to wait for a better entry point as the timing is still not right for investors to hit the Buy button.

The company’s portfolio comprises properties across the United States, including both coastal and Sunbelt locations. This strategy of diversifying the portfolio across geographies and price points limits volatility and concentration risks while aiding the company to generate steady operating cash flows. Our estimate indicates a year-over-year increase of 2.1% in rental income this year.', 'UDR is also leveraging technological initiatives and process enhancements to drive operational resiliency across its platform. Its Next Generation Operating Platform allows the company to electronically interact with and provide service to residents and prospects throughout its diversified portfolio.

It also enjoys favorable investment-grade credit ratings, which enable it to procure debt financing at an attractive cost.', 'Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT investors and UDR remains committed to that. In February 2024, concurrent with the fourth-quarter earnings release, the company rewarded investors with an annual dividend hike of 1.2% to $1.70 per share, resulting in a quarterly dividend of approximately 42.5 cents. The company has increased its dividend five times in the last five years and its five-year annualized dividend growth of 4.60% is encouraging.', 'Though we expect funds from operations as adjusted (FFOA) to record a year-over-year marginal decline in 2024, the metric is expected to rise 3.8% and 7.4% in 2025 and 2026, respectively. Given our FFOA growth projections and UDR’s solid financial position, the latest dividend hike seems sustainable and well covered by cash flow from operations.', 'Over the past month, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 3% compared with the industry’s growth of 2.5%.', '\xa0', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', '\xa0', 'The struggle to lure the renters is likely to persist as the supply volume of new deliveries is expected to remain elevated in a number of its markets.

We expect the metric to rise 2.2% in 2024, which is within the guided range.', 'Moreover, a high interest rate environment is a concern for UDR. Elevated rates imply high borrowing costs for the company, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend aristocrats and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 10 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats To Buy According to Analysts.\xa0', 'Investors often grapple with the decision of whether to invest in growth stocks or value stocks. While both strategies aim to enhance value for investors, they follow distinct paths. The primary distinction lies in the pricing. Growth stocks tend to be pricier, with high valuations relative to their sales or earnings. Conversely, value stocks are more affordable, with lower stock prices in comparison to their sales or earnings. Over time, both growth and value investment approaches have demonstrated comparable performance, yet historical analysis indicates that value investing has been more advantageous for investors in the long term. According to research published by Josef Lakonishok, Andrei Shleifer, and Robert W. Vishny in the Journal of Finance, value strategies tend to yield superior returns. Various investment strategies centered around purchasing undervalued stocks have consistently outperformed those focused on trendy or high-flying stocks from April 1968 to April 1990.', 'The research paper also emphasized that value stocks typically offer significantly higher dividend yields and possess stronger fundamental ratios compared to growth stocks. Both Josef Lakonishok and the value investing expert David Dreman have observed that value investing outperforms growth investing approximately 70% of the time, regardless of the size of the companies involved. Their studies, which encompassed various company sizes, revealed that value stocks consistently delivered average returns of slightly over 7% per year higher than growth stocks over extended periods.', 'As mentioned earlier, dividends are often a key component of value stocks. Among dividend strategies, one of the most popular approaches is investing in dividend aristocrats. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index tracks the performance of companies within the S&P 500 that have consistently increased their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. A report from S&P Dow Jones Indices indicated that strategies focusing on generating income often exhibit significant value characteristics. Investors typically gravitate towards securities offering high dividend yields and lower price multiples. The report also mentioned that the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index demonstrated a blend of both growth and value traits, rather than a pronounced bias towards one style. Analysis of the index composition from 1999 to 2022 revealed its style breakdown. On average, the index maintained a 59.04% exposure to value stocks and a 40.94% exposure to growth stocks during this period.', 'Despite the allure of high-priced growth stocks, value stocks have consistently proven to be advantageous for investors over the long haul. Dimensional Funds conducted an analysis spanning nearly a century, affirming that value stocks typically offer higher expected returns. While there have been occasional downturns, the fundamental principle that lower relative prices correlate with higher expected returns remains steadfast. Value premiums have often manifested swiftly and significantly. For instance, in years when value outperformed growth, the average premium amounted to nearly 15%. On average, in the US, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks by 4.4% annually from 1927 to 2022.', ""Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Emerson Electric Co.

While both strategies aim to enhance value for investors, they follow distinct paths. The primary distinction lies in the pricing. Growth stocks tend to be pricier, with high valuations relative to their sales or earnings. Conversely, value stocks are more affordable, with lower stock prices in comparison to their sales or earnings. Over time, both growth and value investment approaches have demonstrated comparable performance, yet historical analysis indicates that value investing has been more advantageous for investors in the long term. According to research published by Josef Lakonishok, Andrei Shleifer, and Robert W. Vishny in the Journal of Finance, value strategies tend to yield superior returns. Various investment strategies centered around purchasing undervalued stocks have consistently outperformed those focused on trendy or high-flying stocks from April 1968 to April 1990.', 'The research paper also emphasized that value stocks typically offer significantly higher dividend yields and possess stronger fundamental ratios compared to growth stocks. Both Josef Lakonishok and the value investing expert David Dreman have observed that value investing outperforms growth investing approximately 70% of the time, regardless of the size of the companies involved. Their studies, which encompassed various company sizes, revealed that value stocks consistently delivered average returns of slightly over 7% per year higher than growth stocks over extended periods.', 'As mentioned earlier, dividends are often a key component of value stocks. Among dividend strategies, one of the most popular approaches is investing in dividend aristocrats. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index tracks the performance of companies within the S&P 500 that have consistently increased their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. A report from S&P Dow Jones Indices indicated that strategies focusing on generating income often exhibit significant value characteristics. Investors typically gravitate towards securities offering high dividend yields and lower price multiples. The report also mentioned that the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index demonstrated a blend of both growth and value traits, rather than a pronounced bias towards one style. Analysis of the index composition from 1999 to 2022 revealed its style breakdown. On average, the index maintained a 59.04% exposure to value stocks and a 40.94% exposure to growth stocks during this period.', 'Despite the allure of high-priced growth stocks, value stocks have consistently proven to be advantageous for investors over the long haul. Dimensional Funds conducted an analysis spanning nearly a century, affirming that value stocks typically offer higher expected returns. While there have been occasional downturns, the fundamental principle that lower relative prices correlate with higher expected returns remains steadfast. Value premiums have often manifested swiftly and significantly. For instance, in years when value outperformed growth, the average premium amounted to nearly 15%. On average, in the US, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks by 4.4% annually from 1927 to 2022.', ""Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Emerson Electric Co.

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Marketing Dive newsletter.', 'It’s been nearly a decade since National Beverage Corp.’s LaCroix ignited a consumer craze around sparkling water, spurring a rush of investments in the category from larger beverage rivals. Bubly, PepsiCo’s answer to LaCroix that launched in 2018, has hung around where others floundred,\xa0and now aims to shake up a sector that has seen some of its excitement wane.', 'The brand on March 25 will roll out a new product lineup that caters to consumers who view current sparkling water offerings as too steep a trade-off from the sweetness of soda — and a bit boring to boot. Bubly Burst, which boasts zero added sugars and 10 calories or less depending on the flavor, comes in six variants. Names like peach mango, tropical punch and triple berry are available in tall, 16.9-ounce single-serve bottles made of recycled plastic material known as PET.', 'The brand extension lands with a bouncy ad campaign running on social, digital, TV and out-of-home that unites what executives called the Bubly family. Burst and the core sparkling water line come together in energetic creative that makes the product the lead character.\xa0Agency ODD developed the TV spot while Direct Focus handled production duties.', 'PepsiCo executives view Bubly as a potentially major growth driver as shoppers seek healthier purchases without sacrificing a sense of indulgence.', '“I firmly believe Bubly could be our next billion-dollar brand if we really get after it in the right way,” said Todd Kaplan, CMO of Pepsi and sparkling water, in an interview. “Bubly Burst is a great tool to do so and really expand the brand.”', 'Kaplan was responsible for getting Bubly off the ground in his prior role overseeing marketing for PepsiCo’s water portfolio. Bubly, which was projected to rake in $100 million in its first year on the market, was introduced around the 2018 Oscars ceremony and later ran a campaign for the Super Bowl punning on a similarity with crooner Michael Bublé’s name. Kaplan eventually shifted to Pepsi, which was handed PepsiCo’s sparkling water duties in 2022. Bubly today leads the sparkling water pack in terms of both brand awareness and preference, according to Kantar’s 2023 Brand Mind Share report.', 'But consumer habits continue to shift, with more people seeking what Kaplan described as “subtly sweetened” drinks. An internal analysis by the brand estimated about 20 million consumers now prefer a sweetened sparkling water beverage choice, hence the development of Burst, which contains 1% real fruit juice.', '“The people who are looking for this, honestly, it doesn’t just cut one demographic or cohort,” said Kaplan. “They’re not willing to make the trade-off from a soda all the way down to a sparkling water. This gets a little half-step closer.”', 'Kaplan attributed Bubly’s success to a personality that differs from what the executive perceives as staid sparkling water competitors with “private-label type executions.” Bubly packaging emphasizes bright colors and smiley face iconography meant to inspire the bubbly feeling referenced in the product’s name.', 'That sunny disposition is reinforced through the brand’s social media presence, which shows Bubly cans interacting in dollhouse-like setups. A Bubly campaign from January centered on a novelty button that used LTE technology to deliver Bubly to consumers abstaining from alcohol for the month as part of Dry January.', 'Bubly Burst looks to firm up a positioning around fun without rewriting the marketing playbook. Caps are topped with sayings like “thirsty work” while the bottles are printed with light-hearted copy (the watermelon lime flavor has a text bubble reading “your partner in lime.”)\xa0Pineapple tangerine and cherry lemonade round out the lineup.', '“It’s the same visual identity. We didn’t want to launch a new brand, we didn’t want to buy a brand,” said Kaplan. “It’s a little bit more of an elevated, more loud version of Bubly.”', 'PepsiCo has been more active in launching brands and refreshing old ones to stay relevant with choosy consumer groups like Gen Z. The company last year bowed Starry, a lemon-lime replacement for flagging Sierra Mist. Starry ran its first Super Bowl campaign in February with a commercial featuring on-the-rise rapper Ice Spice. Such efforts are the result of stronger alignment between PepsiCo’s research and development, product and marketing teams, according to Kaplan.', '“When we created and launched Bubly ... that was a very new muscle for us, as PepsiCo: to create brands, launch brands from within,” said Kaplan. “Since then, we’ve gotten that muscle fine-tuned.”', 'A bigger focus on innovation comes as chief rival Coca-Cola also ramps up new releases, reigniting the Cola Wars back-and-forth that has long underpinned the trajectories of the two companies.\xa0Coke in February added the first permanent addition to its soda portfolio in three years with Coca-Cola Spiced, a raspberry-flavored cola. Coke and Pepsi are both dedicating more marketing resources to zero-sugar and better-for-you beverages as shoppers steer away from full-sugar options, with Bubly Burst fitting neatly into that strategy.', '“A lot of our growth is going to come from new spaces that are emerging in the beverage space, as well as going a bit deeper in the spaces where we do play,” said Kaplan.']"

We look at Procter & Gamble, right, which China softness was about 100 basis point drag to their organic sales in their fiscal second quarter."", ""So China itself has played again for us. It's mostly selling products in country, so it's more of a consumer demand.

But again, it's the multinationals, and Estee Lauder probably the most specific to China."", ""And I would say, just in terms of Middle East and Malaysia, Indonesia, some of the other countries where there's been some protests related or consumers acting or taking actions against US brands, it's really been the beverages, like Coke and Pepsi have called that out as a source of weakness in this first quarter and potentially now as we go through Ramadan and March.""]"

Readers should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, as these statements are management\'s beliefs and assumptions, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain, and outside of management\'s control. Forward-looking statements may include statements regarding the expected benefits to Cisco, Splunk and their respective customers from the completed transaction, the integration of Splunk\'s and Cisco\'s complementary capabilities to create an end-to-end platform designed to unlock greater digital resilience for customers, plans for future investment and capital allocation, and the expected financial performance of Cisco following the completed transaction. Statements regarding future events are based on Cisco\'s current expectations, estimates, and projections and are necessarily subject to associated risks related to, among other things, (i) the ability of Cisco to successfully integrate Splunk\'s market opportunities, technology, personnel and operations and to achieve expected benefits, (ii) Cisco\'s ability to implement its plans, forecasts and other expectations with respect to Splunk\'s business and realize expected synergies, (iii) the outcome of any legal proceedings related to the transaction, (iv) the effects on the accounting relating to the acquisition of Splunk, (v) legislative, regulatory, and economic developments, (vi) general economic conditions, and (vii) the retention of key personnel. Therefore, actual results may differ materially and adversely from the anticipated results or outcomes indicated in any forward-looking statements. For information regarding other related risks, see the ""Risk Factors"" section of Cisco\'s most recent report on Form 10-Q filed on February 20, 2024 and its most recent report on Form 10-K filed on September 7, 2023, as well as the ""Risk Factors"" section of Splunk\'s most recent report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 28, 2023. The parties undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.', 'Non-GAAP InformationThis press release includes future estimated cash flow, non-GAAP gross margin, and non-GAAP EPS information.', ""Positive or accretive cash flow is the Company's incremental cash flow from operations anticipated to result from the transaction including cash flow from Splunk's operations, expected synergies, and financing costs (including foregone interest income), and excluding certain transaction costs, cash payments related to the one-time conversion of Splunk employee equity awards, and cash retention awards."", 'Non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Cisco believes that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with Cisco\'s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate Cisco\'s results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. Cisco believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and its historical and projected results of operations. We have not reconciled future estimated cash flow, non-GAAP gross margin, or non-GAAP EPS information included in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP measure because this cannot be done without unreasonable effort because we do not currently have sufficient data to accurately estimate the individual adjustments included in the most directly comparable GAAP measure that would be necessary for such reconciliations. We expect the variability of these items to have a potentially unpredictable, and a potentially significant, impact on our future GAAP financial results.', 'View original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cisco-completes-acquisition-of-splunk-302091484.html', 'SOURCE Cisco Systems, Inc.']"
