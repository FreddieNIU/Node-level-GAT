If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on tax implications and relocation trends, you may go to 5 States That Tax Social Security in 2024.', 'If you’re about to retire, chances are you have already figured out how much money you need to retire comfortably and crafted a strategic plan to achieve the goal. In case you haven’t, the latest survey from The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) reveals that Americans estimate they need at least $1.8 million to retire comfortably. While saving up for retirement is a task in itself, the process is multifaceted. One facet of this retirement planning entails not only saving but also strategically managing taxes, including the taxation of Social Security benefits. As retirees transition from their working years to retirement, they encounter varying tax landscapes across different states. For those who are looking to move to other states, many often wonder about the tax implications associated with retiring to them.', 'Rightly so, even though states like Texas and Florida may be popular states to retire to considering they don’t tax retirement income, there are yet many other factors that potential retirees must account for before making a move. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) accurately explains this by asking retirees to take into account their overall tax liability. This tax liability depends largely upon where you choose to live.', 'Here’s what Hayden Adams has to say about retiring to a state like Florida:', '""Florida\'s lack of an income tax may seem like a bargain, but property tax there is high, and the government raises the bulk of its revenue through state and local sales taxes. That\'s why it\'s important to consider your entire tax burden”.', '-Hayden Adams, CPA, CFP®, director of tax and financial planning at The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) Center for Financial Research', 'Then again, companies and organizations like U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE:UHAL), Hire a Helper, and Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN) are quick to spot relocation trends that are in favor of the Sunshine State. For starters, Florida is the top growth state of 2023, only beaten by Texas in the process. The allure of beaches, sunshine, low cost of living, and tax-free environment has continuously helped it rank amongst U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE:UHAL)’s top growth states over the years. Specifically, the Palm Bay-Melbourne market is one of the 7 top growth cities in Florida that U-Haul has identified.', '""Growth in the Palm Bay-Melbourne area has been increasing at an explosive rate. The Space Coast has many companies investing in this region and creating jobs such as Embraer®, SpaceX®, Northrop Grumman®, Lockheed Martin® and L3Harris Technologies®. We have a low cost of living compared to many of the northern cities people have left. Add to that our fantastic year-round climate, and you can see why Palm Bay-Melbourne is such a desirable area to live.""', '- Cal Conner, U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE:UHAL) Company of Eastern Florida president.', 'Similarly, last year’s report from Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN) highlighted how individuals have been relocating to Florida despite of being deemed as “high-risk”. The Redfin analysis revealed that the most flood-prone U.S. counties had an estimated 384,000 more people move in than out in the years 2021 and 2022. One such high-risk area is Lee County, while another is Cape Coral.', '“Builders in Cape Coral have not stopped—they’re just building like nothing happened. That’s largely because there’s plenty of demand for new homes. Many folks who moved into Florida from the Northeast or the West during the pandemic are leaving, but they’re quickly being replaced by new out-of-staters. Some people just want to be on the water no matter what, and/or they want to move here for family, weather or political reasons. The Cape is not slowing down.”', '- Local Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN) Premier real estate agent Isabel Arias-Squires.', 'Judging by the above statistics, it is safe to say that retirees today are only interested in bringing down their costs. This is because a large majority of them are solely reliant on their Social Security checks. For these individuals, it is best to opt for states that don’t tax Social Security benefits in 2024. Ideally, retirees should make informed decisions by meticulously calculating their total tax liabilities, taking into account essential factors such as proximity to family, healthcare services, and other pertinent considerations.', 'Peter Kunasz/Shutterstock.com', 'To compile the list of states that tax Social Security in 2024, we listed out the ten states that still tax Social Security benefits. Next, we ranked them on their tax friendliness and cost of living, with more points given to states that had higher costs of living and lower tax-friendliness. Scores were summed up and places were ranked in an ascending order form the lowest to the highest scores. Previously, two other states were also taxing Social Security, namely Nebraska and Missouri. However, Social Security will not be taxed in Missouri in 2024. Neither will it be taxed in Nebraska.', 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

The state is considered moderately tax-friendly for retirees, and exempts retirement income from taxes depending on their Adjusted Gross Income (AGI). For seniors with an AGI of less than $75,000, their Social Security income isn’t taxed. Tax payers who’s AGI exceeds that limit will have to pay Social Security taxes in full. Other forms of retirement income such as from pensions, IRAs, and 401(k) distributions are fully taxable at a low of 3.1% (on up to $30,000) and a high of 5.7% (on more than $60,000).

Many lists do not include the state of West Virginia when mentioning all the states that tax Social Security. This is because the state has eliminated the tax already for single taxpayers that make less than $50,000 a year. According to WCHS, the House of Delegates sent over a bill that would reduce the social security tax by 35% in 2024, 65% in 2025 and phase it out completely in 2026.\xa0This would make West Virginia more attractive for retirees, as it already has a low cost of living to begin with.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 6\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 ', 'Cost of Living Index: 94\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 ', 'Tax Friendliness: Moderately Tax Friendly ', 'Number eight on our list of states that are still taxing Social Security benefits as of 2024 is New Mexico. From tax year 2022, most seniors have been exempt from paying taxes on their Social Security benefits. The exemption was available to single taxpayers with less than $100,000 in income, to married couples filing jointly, surviving spouses and heads of household with under $150,000 in income, as well as to married couples filing separately with under $75,000 in income. According to Tax Foundation, New Mexico has a sales tax rate of 5% and a max local sales tax rate of 3.8%.

For retirees whose income is above $25,000 for single filers and $41,000 for joint filers, Social Security benefits will be taxed at an income tax rate of 5.9%, notes Kiplinger. Meanwhile, the average effective property tax rate is 0.74%, which is below the national average. Moreover, the sales tax rate is nil. This implies that Montana is one of the few states that do not have a general sales tax.

For seniors aged 65 and above whose federal taxable income tops $24,000; they can subtract the full amount of these benefits from their Colorado tax returns.

1,692f3004-03b9-3993-8d2e-647654bf7306,CTAS,2024-03-31,Results: Cintas Corporation Exceeded Expectations And The Consensus Has Updated Its Estimates,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/results-cintas-corporation-exceeded-expectations-133216524.html,1711805536,STORY,['CTAS'],"[""Investors in Cintas Corporation (NASDAQ:CTAS) had a good week, as its shares rose 7.5% to close at US$687 following the release of its third-quarter results. Cintas reported US$2.4b in revenue, roughly in line with analyst forecasts, although statutory earnings per share (EPS) of US$3.84 beat expectations, being 7.1% higher than what the analysts expected. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models, following these results."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Cintas ', ""Taking into account the latest results, the most recent consensus for Cintas from 17 analysts is for revenues of US$10.3b in 2025. If met, it would imply a solid 9.3% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to swell 11% to US$16.38. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$10.3b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$16.13 in 2025. The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates."", ""With the analysts reconfirming their revenue and earnings forecasts, it's surprising to see that the price target rose 11% to US$686. It looks as though they previously had some doubts over whether the business would live up to their expectations. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Cintas at US$790 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$460. This shows there is still a bit of diversity in estimates, but analysts don't appear to be totally split on the stock as though it might be a success or failure situation."", ""These estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the Cintas' past performance and to peers in the same industry. The period to the end of 2025 brings more of the same, according to the analysts, with revenue forecast to display 7.3% growth on an annualised basis. That is in line with its 6.6% annual growth over the past five years. Juxtapose this against our data, which suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in the industry are forecast to see their revenues grow 6.8% per year. So although Cintas is expected to maintain its revenue growth rate, it's only growing at about the rate of the wider industry."", ""The most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times, with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady, in line with previous estimates. Happily, there were no real changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow in line with the overall industry. There was also a nice increase in the price target, with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving."", ""With that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year. We have forecasts for Cintas going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here."", 'Before you take the next step you should know about the 1 warning sign for Cintas that we have uncovered.', 'Have feedback on this article?

Forecasts indicate a continued decrease in global food prices in 2024 and 2025, by 2 and 3 percent respectively, as worldwide supply improves. It is anticipated that global grain supplies will recover by 42 million metric tons in 2023-24, propelled by heightened maize exports but offset by declines in wheat and rice exports. There is an expectation of a 75 million metric ton increase in oilseed supply, particularly in soybean production surpassing the previous season's record, predominantly in Brazil. The stock-to-use ratio for the food aggregate is expected to stay steady, indicating sufficient supply conditions."", ""Agricultural projections are shaped by factors such as extreme weather events and economic concerns, both domestically and internationally. The USDA's World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report, which offers a forecast for agricultural markets over the next 12–18 months, highlighted that while demand for US meat remains strong, there has been a decrease in cattle numbers due to drought and high production costs. However, growth is anticipated in the pork and poultry industries. The outlook for livestock prices in 2024 is mixed, with an expected increase in beef and pork prices but a decline in prices for broilers and turkeys. Shifts in acreage appear to have a greater impact on crop production than ongoing drought conditions, with an increase in corn acreage and production but a decrease in soybean area and production. Changes in corn and soybean usage and exports impacted stocks and prices for both the 2022/23 and 2023/24 crop years. Overall, the outlook for US agriculture in 2024 indicates lower prices, mixed export and production trends, and declining incomes compared to previous years."", ""The United States is actively supporting its agricultural sector in reclaiming lost overseas markets, particularly against competitors like Brazil and Russia. Agriculture groups have applied for over $900 million in aid under the $1.3 billion Regional Agricultural Promotion Program, which aims to help US farmers access new markets for their crops. With Brazil surpassing the US as the top exporter of corn and soybeans, and Russia leading in wheat exports, the US is striving to regain its competitive edge. Daniel Whitley, administrator of the USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service, emphasized the importance of providing tools for success to US farmers during the National Grain and Feed Association annual convention. The RAP program aims to assist in expanding market reach, particularly targeting Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa for new export opportunities. Whitley highlighted Africa as a promising market due to its growing population and middle class, stressing the need for US companies to establish a presence before it's too late.\xa0"", ""From America's Midwest to the vast farmlands of India, farmers are facing challenges including unfair trade practices, fluctuating crop prices, extreme weather events, and an aging workforce. In the short term, these issues fuel protests, pose dilemmas for policymakers, and threaten to increase grocery prices. However, in the long term, they underscore the broader difficulties of feeding a growing population and addressing hunger crises globally. In the United States, the number of farms is declining as farmers age, and production costs continue to rise. Total farm production expenses have surged by 30% over the past few years, driven by increasing costs of labor, feed, and fertilizer. This trend has led to decreased spending on equipment due to declining crop prices. In India, the small-scale farming industry struggles with low yields and faces challenges from an unpredictable climate. Recent protests by frustrated farmers highlight their demands for debt relief and guarantees on crop prices. Similarly, farmers in Europe, particularly in regions like France, are grappling with rising input costs, trade agreements with countries with less stringent environmental regulations, and pressure from retailers to keep prices low. The EU's push for carbon neutrality by 2050 further complicates matters for farmers, who struggle to offset rising costs while maintaining profitability.

It is about work redesign, it is about taking the lower-value work off the table,"" he told Yahoo Finance on Thursday.', ""The longtime healthcare executive is signaling a seismic shift in how the company operates, with an eye toward fewer verticals within the business. Wentworth, former CEO of pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts, which was acquired by Cigna (CI) in 2018, previously announced 60 VillageMD closures. The co-located clinics and pharmacies were the result of a $5 billion Walgreens partnership in 2020 prior to Wentworth's arrival last year, and were part of a broader strategy to be more health services focused — similar to rival CVS's (CVS) Minute Clinic."", ""The clinics caused a nearly $6 billion drop in the company's second quarter revenue compared to the prior year, the company announced on Thursday. Still, Walgreens managed to beat earnings expectations, reporting earnings per share of $1.20 compared to analyst expectations of $0.82. The company's stock was up nearly 4% in trading Thursday."", ""In its post-results earnings call, Wentworth noted that the National Health Service, the UK's health agency, recently began allowing pharmacists to diagnose and prescribe medication for seven common health conditions, including shingles, UTIs, and sore throats. Boots locations in the UK are part of this new program, which gives Wentworth access to firsthand data on how it works and how it could be replicated in the US."", '""We are on a mission to achieve provider status for our pharmacists, given their influence, which was so clearly highlighted during the pandemic.

Walgreens is in the midst of lobbying Congress to pass a bill with language that would allow Medicare Part B reimbursement for pharmacists providing tests, vaccines and treatments— but would not step on state laws, a spokesperson for Walgreens clarified after the interview Thursday.', 'Wentworth acknowledged the company has faced the same problems as other pharmacies in the past few years — including having to close down more than 100 locations and pausing the buildout of smaller locations in order to better manage resources.', 'Since taking the helm, Wentworth says he has been focusing on a return to the basics. That means facing old problems — such as weak demand for front-of-store consumer items as more customers look to e-commerce and bulk buying amid inflationary pressure.', 'To that end, he recently announced internally that store managers will have more control over their stores and be incentivized to drive growth. In addition, creating a more community-based pharmacy setting — customizing the store based on the location rather than the current big box feel — on the front retail paired with the back end with ""pharmacists operating at the very top of their clinical ability"" is how Walgreens can survive the downward pressure it has faced in recent years, Wentworth said.', '""That\'s the way we\'re able to grow our underlying clinical side of our business while at the same time building trust with patients,"" he said.', 'Anjalee Khemlani is the senior health reporter at Yahoo Finance, covering all things pharma, insurance, care services, digital health, PBMs, and health policy and politics.

That's not surprising, because AI could change how many companies do business while making the industry's leaders tons of money. While tech corporations have grabbed most of the attention, plenty of companies in other industries are implementing AI in lucrative ways."", ""Let's consider two examples in the healthcare sector: Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG) and Medtronic (NYSE: MDT). Here is why both are smart stock picks."", 'Intuitive Surgical has a portfolio of medical devices, none more famous than the da Vinci system. This robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) device allows physicians to perform minimally invasive surgeries using tiny instruments they can manipulate accurately. The company has used AI to improve the performance of some of its products. Here are two examples.', ""Intuitive's SureForm stapler, an instrument used for various purposes with compatible da Vinci systems, employs machine learning algorithms to analyze the thickness of the body tissue it is clamping on, a feature that helps improve performance. Last year, Intuitive Surgical launched Case Insights, a companion tool to the da Vinci system that uses hospital data to build AI models to find links between surgical techniques, patient populations, and outcomes."", 'The company expects to make more AI-related breakthroughs to improve its already high-performing da Vinci system, which has helped the company deliver excellent financial results and share-price gains over the past 10 years.', 'The healthcare giant is an innovative monster, having pioneered the development of RAS devices that assist doctors in performing non-invasive surgeries. These procedures offer a range of advantages, from smaller incisions and less bleeding to faster recovery times and shorter hospital stays. Intuitive Surgical still has a long runway for growth -- only about 5% of procedures that could be performed robotically currently are.', ""Given the company's first-mover advantage in the industry, not to mention the high barriers to entry into this market, it will be extremely challenging to knock Intuitive Surgical off its pedestal. While increasingly incorporating AI into its devices should make a meaningful difference over the long run, Intuitive Surgical was an outstanding stock to buy before the recent AI craze, and it remains so."", ""Medtronic is also implementing AI within some of its medical devices. Consider the company's LINQ II, a cardiac monitoring system. Thanks to AI algorithms, Medtronic has been able to fine-tune this device and decrease the number of false alerts while maintaining a high level of true alerts. In another example of Medtronic's use of AI, the company's Touch Surgery is an AI-powered video platform designed to help train physicians better."", ""Medtronic, too, has big ambitions for AI. Beyond that, the company's prospects remain exciting even though it is having trouble growing its revenue at a good clip in recent years."", ""But the healthcare giant is doubling down on innovation. One of Medtronic's most promising areas is RAS. True, its device, the Hugo system, isn't yet cleared in the U.S. But given how underpenetrated this market is, Medtronic rightly sees it as a significant long-term growth opportunity. It is one of the few medical device giants that may have what it takes to challenge Intuitive Surgical in this field."", ""Medtronic is also looking to make headway in diabetes care, another market with massive untapped potential. Medtronic is a leader in providing pumps for diabetes patients. About 500 million adults in the world now have diabetes. A substantial percentage live in developing countries. Medtronic does business in 150 countries, granting it access to this vast market in ways some competitors can't."", ""Finally, Medtronic is an excellent dividend stock. The company has raised its payouts for 46 consecutive years. It could soon be a Dividend King. Medtronic likely isn't a great growth stock, but it can provide risk-averse investors with stability and solid passive income for years."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Intuitive Surgical right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Intuitive Surgical, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Intuitive Surgical wasn’t one of them.

That makes it the third-largest payment network in the U.S., trailing only Visa (52.6% share) and Mastercard (23.7% share).', 'What makes American Express unique is its positioning among consumers. The company has spent years creating a brand associated with luxury and the finer things in life. The Centurion Card (aka The Black Card) is invite-only and reportedly requires customers to spend anywhere from $500,000 to $1 million annually to be invited. Meanwhile, The Platinum Card commands a $695 annual fee. Both cards are geared toward high-spend customers with expensive tastes and offer perks and rewards with high-end travel providers, luxury hotels, airlines, and high-end clothing lines.', 'American Express\' strong branding and positioning are significant reasons the stock has been a staple in Berkshire Hathaway\'s investment portfolio for years. In an interview with Bloomberg, Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett said: ""I can\'t put in the minds of people what is in their minds about American Express.""', ""American Express competes with Visa and Mastercard, but you can't compare the two businesses on valuation alone. Today, American Express is priced at 20 times earnings, while Visa and Mastercard are priced at 32 and 41, respectively."", ""Despite what it looks like, American Express isn't necessarily a bargain. Instead, its business is slightly different from these competitors. That's because it holds on to credit card loans in addition to processing payments through its network. Visa and Mastercard only process payments, while their banking partners hold on to those credit card loans. Because of this added risk, American Express' valuation tends to be lower and the company is more comparable to a bank."", ""For this reason, investors in American Express want to monitor the company's credit metrics. When the economy is healthy and consumer spending is robust, investors don't have to worry much about credit metrics. However, now may be a time for more caution."", ""Consumer credit card debt is $1.13 trillion, having increased 32% over the past two years. This comes when credit card interest rates are the highest they've been in decades, which could pressure consumers. Signs of stress are beginning to emerge. According to the Federal Reserve, the delinquency rate on credit card loans at commercial banks was 3.2% in the fourth quarter, the highest quarterly level since 2011."", ""American Express is vulnerable to an economic downturn, which can cause delinquencies to move higher. On the plus side, its customer base tends to have higher credit scores than competitors' and is more capable of riding out an economic downturn. In the fourth quarter, American Express wrote off 2% of its credit card loans, which remains below pre-pandemic levels."", 'Despite the risk of rising delinquencies, American Express trades at a premium to recent history following the latest run-up in its stock price. Today, the company is priced at 20.2 times earnings and 2.8 times sales, which are above its 10-year averages.', 'The U.S. consumer is strong, but signs of weakness are emerging. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan has been accurate in his calls about the strength of the consumer over the past couple of years. However, Moynihan said: ""At some point, that consumer will slow down, and they have slowed down their spending,"" noting that spending growth has gone from 10% last year down to 3% to 4% more recently.', ""American Express is an excellent company with a strong brand, and it deserves a spot in investors' portfolios. However, the stock isn't the value it was a few months ago, and a potential slowdown in consumer spending or an uptick in delinquencies could weigh on the company's earnings in the next few quarters. Given the recent 62% increase in the stock, I give American Express a hold rating today."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in American Express right now?', 'Before you buy stock in American Express, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and American Express wasn’t one of them.

These companies have all paid and increased dividends for 50 years or more. This doesn't mean that the streaks will continue forever. Indeed, companies frequently drop off the list. But it does show which companies have a history for operational excellence and prioritize shareholder returns."", ""Three companies that make the Dividend Kings list are beverage giant The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO), Coke's top rival PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP), and food company Hormel Foods (NYSE: HRL). But from an investment perspective, these three companies share even more similarities than just their dividend longevity."", ""For starters, dividend investors like to consider a stock's dividend yield before investing -- this is how much investors have received for the value of their investment in the past year. The chart below shows that Coca-Cola, Pepsi, and Hormel all have a dividend yield close to 3%, giving investors $3 for every $100 invested."", ""Additionally, dividend investors like to consider a company's payout ratio to assess the riskiness of the investment. This measures the percentage of a company's earnings that go toward the dividend. Generally speaking, lower is better. But Coca-Cola, Pepsi, and Hormel have similar payout ratios at 74%, 74%, and 76% respectively."", ""Therefore, there's no clear winner between Coca-Cola, Pepsi, and Hormel when looking at their consecutive years of paying a dividend, their dividend yields, and their payout ratios. These factors being equal, I believe there's another factor to consider. And it makes Hormel the best option for investors looking to buy one of these three stocks today."", ""Over the next several years, I believe Hormel can grow its profits at a better pace than Coca-Cola and Pepsi. And that's why I like it best."", ""Consumers are well aware of Hormel's Chili and Spam. But most are probably unaware of just how many products and brands this company has. And with this portfolio of products, Hormel is on a mission to dominate convenience stores."", ""Hormel has long had a presence in convenience stores but a lot of it is under the radar. For example, investors might not know that it's a top company for pizza toppings and many convenience stores sell hot pizza using Hormel ingredients."", 'Moreover, Hormel sells snacks under its Skippy peanut butter brand, refrigerated snack trays, as well as microwavable meals with its Compleats brand.', 'Hormel had a convenience store presence already but acquired Planters in 2021. Planters is a more pure-play snacking brand and had a broader presence in convenience stores. Now the company can leverage the distribution of the Planters brand to expand the distribution of its other Hormel products.', ""Compared to sales at grocery stores, Hormel's profit margins are better in convenience stores and with its food-service products. Therefore, growth in this area could lead to better profitability. And profit growth leads to more room to service and grow its dividend."", ""Of course, there is a caveat to my upbeat expectations for Hormel: I'm counting on something to start happening within the next few years that's not going to happen this year. Hormel already reported financial results for its fiscal first quarter of 2024 and it gave full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) guidance of $1.51 to $1.65."", ""For perspective, Hormel had adjusted diluted EPS of $1.61 in its fiscal 2023. Therefore, its guidance implies a potential drop in earnings. I'm counting on the growth in convenience-store channels to eventually start having a positive impact beyond fiscal 2024."", ""This uncertainty for Hormel is why Pepsi stock is a close second for a stock to buy today. Pepsi also has a strong path to earnings growth and it's a somewhat simpler proposition."", 'Pepsi is looking to its international business for profit growth more than ever. Revenue for its international operations was up 6% year over year in 2023. However, this led to a more than 200% increase in its international operating profit. And its international operating profit made up 38% of its total operating profit.', 'When discussing profitability for international operations, Pepsi CEO Ramon Laguarta said, ""Our international business is very scaled now."" And this scale points to further profit growth for the company as international sales grow. And Laguarta further said that the company expects international growth to outpace growth in North America again in 2024.', ""Therefore, Pepsi has a simple path to earnings growth, giving the stock upside potential as well. This is something for investors to keep in mind, even though I still believe Hormel's potential for the next several years could be higher."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Hormel Foods right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Hormel Foods, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Hormel Foods wasn’t one of them.
