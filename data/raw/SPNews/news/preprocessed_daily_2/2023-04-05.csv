VRSK has outperformed its industry in the past six months. Its shares have risen 6.4% compared with the industry’s 3.4% growth.Strategic acquisitions bode well for the company, allowing it to expand into newer markets and add to its client base. The shareholder-friendly behavior is another positive for the company. Due to Verisk Analytics’ nature of business, it is exposed to various operational risks like security breaches and dependence on external sources.Verisk Analytics, Inc. PriceVerisk Analytics, Inc. PriceVerisk Analytics, Inc. price | Verisk Analytics, Inc. QuoteThe company reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter 2022 results. Adjusted earnings per share (excluding $1.04 from non-recurring items) was $1.43, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 22.2%. Such an outperformance was supported by strong segmental revenue growth and core operating leverage. Adjusted earnings decreased 2.7% on a year-over-year basis.Total revenues of $630 million surpassed the consensus mark by 2.4% but decreased 17.7% from the year-ago figure. The year-over-year decline in VRSK’s top line can be correlated to the sale of its environmental health and safety business, and Financial Services segment.Current Situation of VRSKVerisk’s growth is driven by its robust growth strategy, based on organic growth, acquisitions and product development. The company has been benefiting from its investments in people and processes. It continues to focus on entering newer markets for increasing solution diversity, developing new proprietary database and predictive analytics.Verisk has been making strategic acquisitions to expand its addressable market. It is also done to increase the company’s data and analytics capabilities across industries. The latest acquisition of Sweden-based InsurTech firm, Mavera, is an indicator of Verisk’s attempt at improving its market position.The company has been consistently rewarding its shareholders in the form of repurchases and dividends. It spent $1.7 billion, $475 million and $348.8 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, for share repurchases. Dividends paid in 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $195.2 million, $188.2 million and $175.8 million, respectively.Story continuesSome Concerning PointsVerisk Analytics' current ratio (a measure of liquidity) at the end of fourth-quarter 2022 was 0.4, lower than 0.46 at the end of the prior quarter and 0.49 at the end of the year-ago quarter. Declining current ratio is not desirable as it indicates that the company may have problems meeting its short-term debt obligations.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderVRSK currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Business Services sector are Omnicom GroupOMC, ICF International ICFI and Gartner, Inc. IT.For first-quarter 2023, OMC’s earnings are expected to increase 41% from the year-ago quarter’s $1.96 per share.

2,4760ad97-5b28-3cde-b542-25036f5b2d2a,SCHW,2023-04-05,Is Schwab Fundamental International Small Company Index ETF (FNDC) a Strong ETF Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schwab-fundamental-international-small-company-102010553.html,1680690010,STORY,['SCHW'],"[The Schwab Fundamental International Small Company Index ETF (FNDC) was launched on 08/13/2013, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund designed to offer broad exposure to the Broad Developed World ETFs category of the market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?Market cap weighted indexes were created to reflect the market, or a specific segment of the market, and the ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on this strategy.Market cap weighted indexes work great for investors who believe in market efficiency. They provide a low-cost, convenient and transparent way of replicating market returns.If you're the kind of investor who would rather try and beat the market through good stock selection, then smart beta funds are your best choice; this fund class is known for tracking non-cap weighted strategies.By attempting to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, non-cap weighted indexes are based on certain fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such.While this space offers a number of choices to investors, including simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies, not all these strategies have been able to deliver superior results.Fund Sponsor &amp; IndexManaged by Charles Schwab, FNDC has amassed assets over $2.90 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs in the Broad Developed World ETFs. Before fees and expenses, FNDC seeks to match the performance of the Russell RAFI Developed ex-U.S. Small Co. Index (Net).The Russell RAFI Developed ex US Small Company Index (Net) measures the performance of the small company size segment by fundamental overall company scores, which are created using as the universe the developed ex U.S. companies in the FTSE Global Total Cap Index.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesCost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same.Story continuesOperating expenses on an annual basis are 0.39% for FNDC, making it on par with most peer products in the space.The fund has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.85%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsWhile ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Taking into account individual holdings, Whitehaven Coal Ltd (WHC) accounts for about 0.26% of the fund's total assets, followed by Aker Bp Asa (AKRBP) and Andritz Ag (ANDR).FNDC's top 10 holdings account for about 1.11% of its total assets under management.Performance and RiskSo far this year, FNDC has gained about 6.72%, and is down about -5.09% in the last one year (as of 04/05/2023). During this past 52-week period, the fund has traded between $26.94 and $34.96.FNDC has a beta of 0.92 and standard deviation of 18.52% for the trailing three-year period, which makes the fund a low risk choice in the space. With about 1799 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab Fundamental International Small Company Index ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Broad Developed World ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.Vanguard Total International Stock ETF (VXUS) tracks FTSE Global All Cap ex US Index and the Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF (VEA) tracks FTSE Developed All Cap ex US Index. Vanguard Total International Stock ETF has $54.76 billion in assets, Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF has $109.62 billion. VXUS has an expense ratio of 0.07% and VEA charges 0.05%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Broad Developed World ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. That's why when we briefly looked at Texas Instruments' (NASDAQ:TXN) ROCE trend, we were very happy with what we saw.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Texas Instruments:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.42 = US$10b ÷ (US$27b - US$3.0b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Therefore, Texas Instruments has an ROCE of 42%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Semiconductor industry average of 14%. See our latest analysis for Texas Instruments roceIn the above chart we have measured Texas Instruments' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Texas Instruments.What Does the ROCE Trend For Texas Instruments Tell Us?We'd be pretty happy with returns on capital like Texas Instruments. The company has employed 57% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 42%. With returns that high, it's great that the business can continually reinvest its money at such appealing rates of return. If Texas Instruments can keep this up, we'd be very optimistic about its future.The Key TakeawayTexas Instruments has demonstrated its proficiency by generating high returns on increasing amounts of capital employed, which we're thrilled about. On top of that, the stock has rewarded shareholders with a remarkable 111% return to those who've held over the last five years. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we still believe the stock deserves further research.Story continuesSince virtually every company faces some risks, it's worth knowing what they are, and we've spotted   3 warning signs for Texas Instruments   (of which 2 are concerning!) that you should know about.High returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

Adjusted diluted EPS is adjusted net income divided by diluted weighted average shares outstanding. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for FCF is “net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment.” The most directly comparable GAAP measure for EBITDA is “net income”, which includes the impact of net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization of acquired intangible assets. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for adjusted EBITDA is “net income”, which includes the impact of net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, share-based payment expense, special charges, and miscellaneous (income) expense, net. A reconciliation of each measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available in this news release. The Company’s non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, have limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP financial measures. Our presentation of such measures, which may include adjustments to exclude unusual or non-recurring items, should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by other unusual or non-recurring items.Forward-Looking InformationThis press release includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”).

AYI is slated to announce second-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Apr 4, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 12.7% and increased 15.4% year over year. The top line increased 0.5% but missed the consensus mark.Acuity Brands beat earnings expectations in the trailing 11 quarters.Trend in Estimate RevisionFor the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share has been unchanged at $2.54 in the past 60 days. The estimate figure indicates a decrease of 1.2% from the $2.57 per share reported in the year-ago quarter. The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $959.99 million, suggesting a 5.6% increase from the year-ago reported figure of $909.1 million.Acuity Brands Inc Price and EPS Surprise Acuity Brands Inc Price and EPS SurpriseAcuity Brands Inc price-eps-surprise | Acuity Brands Inc QuoteFactors to NoteHigher pricing and the filling of back orders, along with renovation projects, are likely to have aided the company’s sales in the to-be-reported quarter. The focus on product vitality and service levels, strong contributions from both of its segments and benefits from the OSRAM DS business acquisition are likely to have contributed to Acuity Brands' growth in second-quarter fiscal 2023.The company has been banking on its strength in the go-to-market channels and its product portfolio. It has been focused on investing in product development. It has been introducing lighting and control products, and evolving certain product and solutions portfolio parts. These products use fewer inputs and are highly mobile. Some of the products are globally sourced, while others are manufactured in the company’s facilities to mitigate the supply-chain complexity, thereby helping to improve margins.However, higher raw material and freight costs, along with supply-chain disruptions for electrical components, are likely to have put some pressure on its fiscal second-quarter margins. Again, slowing housing demand, project delays and more competitive pricing are likely to have been added headwinds.Story continuesWhat Our Model IndicatesOur proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for Acuity Brands this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Currently, the company has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +7.38%.

SWIM has an Earnings ESP of +8.70% and a Zacks Rank #3.SWIM’s earnings missed the consensus mark in all the trailing four quarters, the average negative surprise being 91.8%. The company is expected to report a loss of 8 cents per share in the to-be-reported quarter.Recent ReleasesKB Home KBH reported better-than-expected results in first-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended Feb 28, 2023), defying the challenging housing market conditions. Its earnings and revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Pertaining to the quarterly results, Jeffrey Mezger, chairman, president and chief executive officer, stated, “Our revenues were at the high end of our guidance range and we outperformed both our operating and gross margin expectations. In addition, we further expanded our book value per share, which grew to $44.80, up 27% from a year ago.”Lennar Corporation LEN reported impressive results for first-quarter fiscal 2023, wherein earnings and revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Pertaining to the prospect, Stuart Miller, executive chairman of Lennar, said, ""As we have seen over the past quarters, interest rates are fluctuating and are likely to continue to move and the housing market will continue to rebalance pricing and interest rates. While we have a clear-cut strategy of execution, we will only give broad boundaries for deliveries and gross margin.”Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

19,140b288d-367c-3ddb-a30d-a3d3fed77b2f,ARE,2023-04-05,How to Maximize Your Retirement Portfolio with These Top-Ranked Dividend Stocks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/maximize-retirement-portfolio-top-ranked-131001145.html,1680527401,STORY,['ARE'],"[Believe it or not, seniors fear running out of cash more than they fear dying.Also, retirees who have constructed a nest egg have valid justifications to be concerned, since the traditional ways to plan for retirement may mean income can no longer cover expenses. Some retirees are now tapping their principal to make a decent living, pressed for time between decreasing investment balances and longer life expectancies.Your parents' retirement investing plan won't cut it today.In the past, investors going into retirement could invest in bonds and count on attractive yields to produce steady, reliable income streams to fund a predictable retirement. 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s hovered around 6.50%, whereas the current rate is much lower.The effect of this drop in rates is substantial: over 20 years, the change in yield for a $1 million investment in 10-year Treasuries is over $1 million.In addition to the considerable drop in bond yields, today's retirees are nervous about their future Social Security benefits. Because of certain demographic factors, it's been estimated that the funds that pay the Social Security benefits will run out of money in 2035.Unfortunately, it looks like the two traditional sources of retirement income - bonds and Social Security - may not be able to adequately meet the needs of present and future retirees. But what if there was another option that could provide a steady, reliable source of income in retirement?Invest in Dividend StocksAs a replacement for low yielding Treasury bonds (and other bond options), we believe dividend-paying stocks from high quality companies offer low risk and stable, predictable income investors in retirement seek.Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.One approach to recognizing appropriate stocks is to look for companies with an average dividend yield of 3% and positive average annual dividend growth. Numerous stocks hike dividends over time, counterbalancing inflation risks.Story continuesHere are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.Amgen (AMGN) is currently shelling out a dividend of $2.13 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.52%. This compares to the Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry's yield of 0% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.71%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 10.23%. Check Amgen (AMGN) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE) is paying out a dividend of $1.21 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.85% compared to the REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry's yield of 4.68% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 5.22% over the past year. Check Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $0.57 per share, Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) has a dividend yield of 3.29%.

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.U.S. Bancorp in FocusHeadquartered in Minneapolis, U.S. Bancorp (USB) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of -17.34% so far this year. Currently paying a dividend of $0.48 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 5.33%. In comparison, the Banks - Major Regional industry's yield is 4.52%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.71%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.92 is up 2.1% from last year. In the past five-year period, U.S. Bancorp has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 8.58%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. U.S. Bancorp's current payout ratio is 43%. This means it paid out 43% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.USB is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $4.95 per share, with earnings expected to increase 11.24% from the year ago period.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.Story continuesBig, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, USB is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

While she liked the bank, she quickly found the job itself - literally, manning the safe deposit vault all day - to be less than stimulating.So when the role of maintenance worker at the branch opened up, Getz literally jumped at the opportunity. She had spent her childhood helping her father, a carpenter, doing all manner of plumbing and home repairs and knew she was qualified for the job.The only problem: no woman had ever held a role in the bank's maintenance department before, and her male colleagues and hiring managers were skeptical that she would have the strength or stamina required.""It was not easy for me to get that job,"" Getz said. Although she convinced them to hire her, she was on probationary status for an entire year, rather than the typical 90 days, all while receiving a lower wage than the $5 an hour her male counterparts received - a pay differential that was customary at many companies at the time.Nonetheless, Getz loved her job and thrived in the role, expanding her responsibilities to handle maintenance for five branches in the area. The Lake Street branch remained nearest to her heart, and she got to a point where she could tell what was wrong with the building ""simply by the sounds it was making,"" she said - whether it was a plumbing issue or if the air handling system wasn't working right.Contrary to the initial concerns of her coworkers, she had almost no issues with the physical demands of the job, including moving heavy boxes around the stock room or cleaning up sewage from plumbing problems in the bathroom.""The only thing I couldn't do was go up a ladder vertically, like to replace a light in a stairwell - I was too much of a coward to do that,"" she said.Story continues(Check out the #usbankroadtrip video on some of the U.S. Bank memorabilia Getz has collected and curated over the years above.)#usbankroadtrip: Lake St., MinneapolisEvery company needs a Cheri Kay. She's a banker who loves history, and over the years, she's made it her mission to save stuff. Thanks, Cheri Kay! #usbankroadtrip #usbanklifeDuring the 1980s, the Lake Street branch was bustling - it had 25 teller windows on the main floor, in addition to a basement, sub-basement and multiple corporate offices. Getz created a computer program to track all of the stock supplies in her five buildings at the appropriate levels, an idea that caught on with other maintenance workers.Over time, though, consumer habits changed and the Lake Street branch reduced its footprint. Getz spent nine years in the role before the company decided to outsource maintenance to a vendor.She then transitioned into a role as a teller and found she thrived in that position, too, because she loves working with people - especially the community around Lake Street she knows so well.""That building was my home for 40 years,"" she said. So it was heartbreaking when the property was damaged during civil unrest in May 2020.Within weeks, U.S. Bank set up a mobile banking unit in the branch's parking lot to help the community with banking services, and Getz was eager to volunteer to staff it because she knew the customers would want to see familiar faces when they came back.She now works as a banker at the new branch about a mile away at 3600 East Lake Street, but before construction crews tore down the damaged old location, she got permission for a bittersweet final tour.""I took one last tour through the building, and I could still see my name on some of the tags documenting work and maintenance on the air handling unit and all throughout the basement and sub-basement,"" she said.While the new building has none of the familiar sounds of the old Lake Street branch, Getz said, the welcoming feeling is the same.""I live in this community, I work in this community, my religion is in this community,"" she said. ""This community knows and trusts me, and I want them to know that the bank is always going to be here for them.""View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from U.S. Bank on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: U.S. BankWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/us-bankEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: U.S. BankView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/747290/Meet-the-First-Woman-To-Work-in-Maintenance-at-US-Bank]"

With 65% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Last week’s 5.0% gain means that institutional investors were on the positive end of the spectrum even as the company has shown strong longer-term trends. One-year return to shareholders is currently 8.9% and last week’s gain was the icing on the cake.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Cintas, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Cintas ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Cintas?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Cintas does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Cintas' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Cintas. Because actions speak louder than words, we consider it a good sign when insiders own a significant stake in a company. In Cintas' case, its Top Key Executive, Scott Farmer, is the largest shareholder, holding 14% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 10% and 7.5% of the stock.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 17 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of CintasThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.It seems insiders own a significant proportion of Cintas Corporation. It has a market capitalization of just US$47b, and insiders have US$7.0b worth of shares in their own names. That's quite significant. Most would say this shows a good degree of alignment with shareholders, especially in a company of this size. You can  click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 20% stake in Cintas. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

(NYSE:WMT) has announced that it will be paying its dividend of $0.57 on the 30th of May, an increased payment from last year's comparable dividend. This makes the dividend yield about the same as the industry average at 1.5%. Check out our latest analysis for Walmart Walmart's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsSolid dividend yields are great, but they only really help us if the payment is sustainable. Prior to this announcement, Walmart's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that a large portion of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 69.8%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 31%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendWalmart Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.88 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $2.28. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 1.9% over that duration. Dividends have grown relatively slowly, which is not great, but some investors may value the relative consistency of the dividend.We Could See Walmart's Dividend GrowingSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. It's encouraging to see that Walmart has been growing its earnings per share at 5.6% a year over the past five years. Shareholders are getting plenty of the earnings returned to them, which combined with strong growth makes this quite appealing.Walmart Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Walmart is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

44,ce3eb972-79b6-3bfc-a7fb-ad7140f81ec9,EQR,2023-04-05,Is it Wise to Retain Equity Residential (EQR) Stock for Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wise-retain-equity-residential-eqr-151903534.html,1680535143,STORY,['EQR'],"[Equity Residential EQR has a diversified presence in the urban and suburban markets of Boston, New York, Washington, DC, Seattle, San Francisco and Southern California and is well-poised to benefit from the healthy demand for its residential properties in these markets. For 2023, we estimate the total rental income to grow 3.5% year over year.The company is banking on technology and organizational capabilities to drive innovation, rent growth and improve the efficiency of its operating platform. This is likely to provide EQR competitive edge over others.To enhance its portfolio quality, Equity Residential has been making efforts toward repositioning its portfolio by disposing of older properties and acquiring newer properties in submarkets with high numbers of affluent renters and favorable long-term demand drivers.In 2022, the company acquired a 172-unit apartment property in San Diego for $113 million. In the same period, it disposed of three consolidated rental properties, comprising 945 apartment units, for $746.1 million.The residential REIT has also been making concerted efforts to diversify its portfolio and expand its footprint in the suburban markets, wherein these affluent renters prefer to live, work and play. EQR’s efforts to capture the renter demand in these markets are likely to pay off well in the upcoming period.Equity Residential has an encouraging development pipeline. As of Dec 31, 2022, the company had eight projects (consolidated and unconsolidated) under development, comprising 2,519 apartment units, with total project costs of $505.9 million.On the balance sheet front, the company exited 2022 with $2.4 billion of liquidity and net debt to normalized EBITDAre of 4.38X. Its limited near-term debt maturities and solid credit metrics poise it well to capitalize on growth opportunities.Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticements for REIT shareholders, and Equity Residential remains committed to the same. In March 2023, the residential REIT increased its quarterly cash dividend on its common stock to 66.25 cents per share from 62.50 cents paid out earlier, marking a hike of 6% on its annualized dividend.We expect the company’s dividend rate to be sustainable, given the company’s solid operating platform, our funds from operations (FFO) growth projections of 5.5% for 2023 and solid balance-sheet strength than industry counterparts.Nonetheless, the lack of governmental rental assistance in 2023 and rent-control regulations in some of the major markets may weigh on EQR’s revenue growth to a certain extent. Also, an expected slowdown in job growth can hurt leasing volume in the upcoming period.An elevated supply in some of Equity Residentials’ markets like Denver, Dallas, Fort Worth, Austin and Atlanta can subdue demand for its properties, affecting profitability.Rising interest rates are likely to increase the company's borrowing costs, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 12.4% in the past six months compared with its industry’s fall of 8%.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are Alexandria Real Estate Equities ARE and Terreno Realty TRNO, each currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), and Service Properties Trust SVC, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Microchip Technology MCHP, DSV DSDVY and Trane Technologies TT.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:Rain Brings Wildflowers: Global Week AheadIn the Global Week Ahead, a fresh April Spring is in the air, at least here in California.Rains bring wildflower blooms.In the major money centers of the world, any banking crisis appears contained -- for the time being.With the turn of a month, and the end of Q1, it is time to look at how the real U.S. and global economy is faring.The winter quarter is over.On Monday, we get a March read on purchasing manager activity (PMIs) from the well-followed Institute of Supply Management (ISM).On Friday, the all-important March U.S. Federal monthly jobs report lands.In the Southern Hemisphere, policy rate decisions arrive via the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and their close counterpart, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ).If banking tension continues to recede?There should be sentiment for long-term U.S. Treasury yields to rise, and the U.S. dollar to regain safe haven ground, after a surprising March disappears.Next are Reuters’ five world market themes, reordered for equity traders—(1) On Friday, traders inspect March nonfarm payrolls.After weeks of worry about the banking sector, Friday’s U.S. employment data shifts the focus back to the macro picture.Traders will be keen to learn whether the Federal Reserve’s barrage of rate increases is cooling the economy.Views on the likely trajectory of rates have once again diverged. Fed officials project rates will remain around current levels for the rest of 2023 to help slow growth and fight inflation. A strong jobs number would support that view.Story continuesEconomists polled by Reuters expect a rise of 240,000 in March, so anything short of that would suggest the Fed could cut rates this year as tighter monetary policy bites and growth softens.That outlook — bolstered by the tumult in the banking sector — is one held by many investors.Futures markets are pricing a roughly 50% chance of a 25-basis-point rate increase at the central banks next meeting, in May, followed by cuts throughout the rest of 2023.(2) Will there be a recession in 2023, or 2024, or not?Turmoil in the banking sector, following the collapse of U.S. lender Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse's rescue merger with UBS, risks global banks adopting more austere lending standards as they strive to prove they are well-capitalized.Monthly purchasing managers indexes, the real-time indicators of business conditions, are due out in the first week of April. The early ""flash"" version of this survey for the U.S. showed manufacturers' new orders had fallen for the sixth straight month.Conviction is now building among investors and central bankers that banking stress and a potential follow-on credit crunch make a hard landing for the world's largest economy more likely.The optimistic take, for the equities market at least, is it brings central bank interest rate cuts into view, with stock-pickers focusing on high quality, defensive companies, in industries such as healthcare and consumer staples, that may weather a recession well.(3) What about the bond markets, after a banking crisis emerges?Two-year U.S. borrowing costs are about to post their sharpest drop since 2008 in March as banking turmoil wiped out bets on further central bank rate hikes.They dropped over 60 basis points, but don't forget they rose by a similar amount in February, when all the focus was on sticky inflation and a red-hot labor market.Bond markets were whipsawed this quarter and trading became so challenging that investors drew parallels with the market environment during Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the COVID-19 pandemic.Now, just as traders were settled to the idea that rate hikes would soon end, above-forecast German data on Thursday let the inflation genie back out of the bottle, sending bond yields sharply higher.Until markets get a clear sense of whether financial stability or inflation will drive central banks going forward, expect more turbulence.(4) What to make of the U.S. dollar?Spring is finally here, and the dollar has posted its weakest performance for the first quarter since 2018, falling -1.3%, despite the swell of safe-haven demand the banking crisis unleashed.Historically, Q1 is the strongest for the dollar. On average, over the last 50 years, the dollar has gained +1.1% between January and March, while Q4 is its weakest, with an average drop of -0.8%.Fund managers slashed their bearish positions during February's 2.5% rally, but they're still sitting on a short position of $5.289 billion, according to Refinitiv data.In theory, those bearish bets could be bought back and even flipped into bullish ones.Traders are short, but not that short. With maybe one more rate hike priced in, inflation cooling and the banking crisis contained — for now — there don't seem to be too many reasons to spring for the dollar.(5) On Tuesday, will the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) take up the policy rate?A recent run of tepid Australian data — along with continued risks of a banking crisis — have seen markets price out pretty much any chance for a rate hike on Tuesday by the Reserve Bank.In fact, there's even a sense that the 10-month tightening campaign may have run its course.A report on March 28th provided more evidence of tighter purse strings. Consumer price figures a day later backed the case that inflation has peaked, rounding out the data points that RBA officials said they would watch closely ahead of their decision.Across the Tasman, bets are still for the Reserve Bank of New Zealand to hike by another quarter point on Wednesday, and traders place a good chance of the same again by July.But markets don't expect the additional move needed to reach the central bank's own projected 5.5% peak.Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY) StocksI found three large cap stocks with long-term Zacks Growth scores of A or B.(1) Microchip Technology: This is a $83 a share stock.

Recognizing the strain this debt can have on the financial health of today's workforce, Upwise™ from MetLife has teamed up with Savi, a social impact technology company, to help borrowers navigate available federal loan forgiveness programs.Launched in 2021, Upwise is MetLife's personalized financial wellness app that recognizes the connection between emotions and money and delivers a seamless experience providing unique features and expert content to help individuals build healthy financial habits. Integrating Savi's capabilities into MetLife’s high-tech solution enables individuals to take a holistic view of their personal finances and understand how student loan debt impacts their financial health. This includes assessing their eligibility for relief, and exploring repayment and loan forgiveness options, all while improving their relationship with their finances.""The weight of student loan debt can take a toll on employees' financial and mental health – from prioritizing monthly loan payments over other financial goals to potentially feeling stressed and anxious about the amount of debt,"" said Ellen Pedersen, vice president and head of product, Upwise. ""The addition of Savi's student loan expertise to the Upwise experience enables borrowers to more easily navigate the complex and overwhelming Public Service Loan Forgiveness process.""This collaboration will not only simplify the application process for federal loan payment and forgiveness programs, but also provide clarity and confidence to individuals navigating the stresses of federal student loans and monthly repayments. To date, Savi has identified more than $1 billion in projected loan forgiveness opportunities for student loan borrowers and can reduce monthly student loan payments by $150/month.Story continues""With President Biden's debt forgiveness plan preparing to make its way through the Supreme Court, and loan payments set to resume later this year, navigating student loan repayment can feel overwhelming and uncertain,"" said Aaron Smith, Co-Founder of Savi.Savi Co-Founder Tobin Van Ostern also adds: ""Upwise works with many Fortune 500 employers, and we're excited to help both address the burden of student loan debt.""Why Employers Should CareThis collaboration comes as the workforce continues to show greater preference for companies that prioritize the mental and financial well-being of their employees. According to MetLife's 2023 U.S. Employee Benefit Trends Study, 62% of employees are looking to their employer for more help in achieving financial security through employee benefits (up from 57% last year).When employees' financial health declines, so does their mental well-being, which in turn, negatively impacts their productivity levels and job loyalty. In fact, the proportion of U.S. employees who say they are less productive at work because of financial worries has steadily risen year over year, having increased to 36% in 2023 (up from 32% in 2022 and 27% in 2021)2.With Savi's integration and at no cost, employers can offer Upwise as a high-tech solution for eligible employees to take immediate action towards reducing their student debt – which may help to increase their financial security and freedom in stride.Upwise™ is available for download on the App Store and Google Play.

However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.MET currently has a forward P/E ratio of 6.99, while BBSEY has a forward P/E of 8.70. We also note that MET has a PEG ratio of 0.53. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. BBSEY currently has a PEG ratio of 0.67.Another notable valuation metric for MET is its P/B ratio of 1.66. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, BBSEY has a P/B of 7.82.Story continuesBased on these metrics and many more, MET holds a Value grade of A, while BBSEY has a Value grade of D.MET stands above BBSEY thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that MET is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.On top of the Zacks Rank, investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will want to focus on the ""Value"" category. Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and ""A"" grades for Value will be some of the highest-quality value stocks on the market today.One company to watch right now is MetLife (MET). MET is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 6.83. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 8.51. Over the past year, MET's Forward P/E has been as high as 10.27 and as low as 6.41, with a median of 8.48.Investors will also notice that MET has a PEG ratio of 0.52. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. MET's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 0.71. MET's PEG has been as high as 5.74 and as low as 0.22, with a median of 1.05, all within the past year.We should also highlight that MET has a P/B ratio of 1.64. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks attractive against its industry's average P/B of 2.53. Within the past 52 weeks, MET's P/B has been as high as 2.47 and as low as 0.89, with a median of 1.49.Story continuesValue investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement, so they are often considered a better performance indicator. MET has a P/S ratio of 0.64. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.91.These figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at, but they help show that MetLife is likely being undervalued right now. Considering this, as well as the strength of its earnings outlook, MET feels like a great value stock at the moment.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Also, O has a diversified portfolio with respect to tenant, industry, geography and property type.These assure stable revenue generation for the company. For 2023, we estimate total revenues to grow 7.4% year over year.Realty Income’s accretive buyouts and development initiatives seem encouraging for its external growth. In 2022, it invested $8.9 billion in 1,301 properties and properties under development or expansion. This included properties in the United States and Europe.Recently, the company signed a definitive agreement with EG Group to acquire up to 415 single-tenant convenience store properties in the United States. The buyout is expected to close in second-quarter 2023, subject to various customary closing conditions.Realty Income anticipates incurring more than $5 billion in acquisitions in 2023.Moreover, O’s capital-recycling efforts bode well for growth and relieve the pressure off its balance sheet.On the balance sheet front, the company exited 2022 with nearly $1.7 billion of liquidity, net debt to annualized pro forma adjusted EBITDAre of 5.3X and fixed charge coverage of 5.2X. Further, its investment-grade credit ratings of A- (Stable) and A3 (Stable) from Standard &amp; Poor’s and Moody’s, respectively, render it favorable access to the debt market.With a well-laddered debt-maturity schedule and enough financial flexibility, O is well-positioned to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.Solid dividend payouts are the biggest enticements for REIT shareholders, and Realty Income remains committed to that. In March 2023, “The Monthly Dividend Company” increased its monthly cash dividend on its common stock, marking the 120th dividend increase since its NYSE listing in 1994.We expect the company’s dividend rate to be sustainable, given its solid operating platform, our adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) growth projections of 7.1% for 2023 and a lower debt-to-equity ratio than industry counterparts.Nonetheless, given the conveniences of online shopping, rising e-commerce adoption is concerning for Realty Income. Also, limited consumers’ willingness to spend due to macroeconomic uncertainty could impair the company’s top-line growth.A major part of O’s tenant roster comprises single-client properties, which expose it to the risks associated with tenant defaults. This could hurt the company’s rental revenues generated from that property.Rising interest rates might increase the company's borrowing costs, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate. Our estimate for 2023 interest expenses indicates a year-over-year rise of 6.4%.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 7.4% in the past six months compared with the industry’s growth of 15.4%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the retail REIT sector are Regency Centers REG, Federal Realty Investment Trust FRT and Essential Properties Realty Trust EPRT, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

But the groundwork had been laid for years.Most Read from BloombergWarner Bros. Nears Deal for Harry Potter Online TV SeriesUBS Chairman’s Top-Secret Prep Paid Off in Credit Suisse MomentWall Street Shuns Risk as Recession Talk Ramps Up: Markets WrapTop Tax Mistakes to Avoid If You Make More Than $100,000The Final Mission for a California Military Base: Become HousingWhen Colm Kelleher became chairman last April, he inherited feasibility studies by predecessor Axel Weber dating back to at least 2020 on what a takeover of Credit Suisse Group AG would look like. And early this year, after clients pulled tens of billions of dollars from the Paradeplatz neighbor, Kelleher called on a small group of top advisers from his alma mater Morgan Stanley to ramp up contingency planning, according to people with direct knowledge of matter.The project was top secret and few at the US bank knew what their senior mergers and financial services colleagues were working on with a tight circle of UBS executives, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing the extent of the preparations. Those efforts meant that in mid-March, as a crisis of confidence that started in US regional banking spread to Switzerland, UBS was ready to go.On March 15, when Credit Suisse received a lifeline from the Swiss central bank, its crosstown rival quickly turned from war gaming to execution. UBS called on the Morgan Stanley advisers and bankers at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., some of whom jetted down to Zurich and signed non-disclosure agreements.What followed was round-the-clock negotiations on the decisive weekend that saw some advisers working on just three hours of sleep and without showers. That produced a rescue deal that wiped out some bondholders, trampled on traditional shareholder rights, heightened too-big-to-fail concerns and enraged the Swiss public — but managed to stave off an even bigger global crisis.Story continuesReward, RiskThe emergency tie-up offers huge upside for a bank that investors already valued as Europe’s healthiest major firm — as well as enough risk to threaten that title. At its helm is a 65-year-old Irish banker well acquainted with how a crisis transaction can reshape a company and how a volatile investment bank can derail it.Kelleher will oversee the most impactful bank combination in more than a decade. It’s one that will shape the global battle for the lucrative business of managing elite wealth, and create a megabank that not only dwarfs every other Swiss lender but is double the size of the nation’s economy.“This is not in any way an easy deal to do,” Kelleher told shareholders at the firm’s annual meeting Wednesday, saying the integration will take three to four years. “You can’t just put numbers together and reach a sum. You have to understand that there is huge amount of risk in integrating these businesses.”The comments came a day after Credit Suisse’s board spent their annual meeting apologizing to angry investors. Switzerland’s banking regulator said Wednesday it considered putting Credit Suisse into bankruptcy after an “unprecedented” bank run, before deciding on the takeover.UBS has started gathering teams to assess the stars, systems and clients it wants to keep from a massive deal that creates a bank with over $1.5 trillion in assets and more than 12,000 wealth managers spread across the globe.Spokespeople for UBS and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.Bargain PriceUBS shareholders have largely applauded a purchase that saw the firm grab its rival for, by one measure, 5 cents on the dollar. The 3 billion-franc ($3.3 billion) deal was backed by extensive guarantees and liquidity provisions, and offered a golden opportunity to land the crown jewels of Credit Suisse — its Swiss and wealth management businesses — at a bargain price.One way of viewing it: Last year, UBS agreed to spend $1.4 billion on US roboadviser Wealthfront and its $27 billion in assets under management, before the acquisition abruptly collapsed. With Credit Suisse, it had just paid little over double that for more than 50 times the client assets.Bondholders, meanwhile, have been more focused on the downside, with credit rating agencies cutting their outlooks on UBS’s debt. Investors need only listen to Kelleher to understand why. The deal was just hours old when Kelleher reached out to Sergio Ermotti, ultimately bringing UBS’s former chief executive officer back and pushing aside Ralph Hamers in favor of a leader with more experience on dramatic restructurings.“I would argue it’s bigger than any deal that was done in 2008,” Kelleher said at a press conference last week explaining the move. “That brings with it significant execution risk.”History LessonUBS has traded steady progress on a low-risk strategy for a political spotlight, years of integration efforts and tens of thousands of job cuts. Executives will have to convince bankers who were not long ago rivals to cooperate, and stave off poaching efforts from other global firms preying on the uncertainty.Iqbal Khan, who helped run Credit Suisse’s wealth business for several years before jumping to UBS in 2019, has already been on the road courting his former colleagues to stick around as his bank aims to halt a talent exodus before the deal closes.“The task of integrating CS will be huge, even if plans existed prior to the latest events,” said Barbara Casu, professor of banking and finance at Bayes Business School.Kelleher will know the upside of getting it right.One of nine children who grew up in Ireland’s County Cork, he spent more than 25 years at Morgan Stanley, rising through the trading and capital markets ranks. A lively and outgoing salesman with a fondness for golf, cigars and modern British art, he served as the Wall Street bank’s chief financial officer during the financial crisis, even conducting business lying down on his office floor after suffering a back injury in a car accident.It was while in this role that the University of Oxford history major helped oversee Morgan Stanley’s bold move to buy Citigroup Inc.’s Smith Barney brokerage unit in early 2009.The integration took several years and hit stumbling blocks at the start, but its success transformed Morgan Stanley into a wealth management giant and made it the best-performing major global bank stock of the last 10 years. The Wall Street firm is currently the only investment bank that can boast more than $5 trillion of client assets across its wealth and investment management businesses. UBS says its Credit Suisse takeover will now make that two.Kelleher’s role after the financial crisis was to fix Morgan Stanley’s investment bank so the more stable wealth unit could shine. There, he dealt with a trading business that was unwinding long-dated derivatives and illiquid, hard-to-value assets — a process that occasionally led to chunky losses. As he now tackles Credit Suisse’s investment bank, he has a 9 billion-franc government backstop in case those same types of assets prove tricky.Having downsized its own trading operations under Ermotti around a decade a go, UBS has little attachment to the markets businesses Credit Suisse is bringing into its fold — particularly its fixed income division. Much will be wound down as UBS aims for a combined investment bank that accounts for 25% of its risk-weighted assets.UBS itself was created in a merger 25 years ago between Swiss Bank Corp. and Union Bank of Switzerland that featured grand wealth-management ambitions and fallout from trading risk. And to execute this combination, Kelleher will be able to lean on Ermotti, an executive who has been in this seat before. During his nine-year stint as UBS CEO between 2011 and 2020, Ermotti steered the group through a restructuring that moved it away from riskier business lines after it had to take a government bailout in the financial crisis. The shares still are below where they traded before that crisis.One of Ermotti’s unfulfilled ambitions from his time in charge was to execute a large, transformational acquisition for UBS. The Swiss national, who kept in touch with Hamers after handing over the reins, now has his chance, having been deemed the best fit for what comes next: selling off Credit Suisse’s troublesome investment banking assets, while at the same time building a powerhouse of wealth management and restoring the standing of Switzerland’s finance industry.For Kelleher, who walked the Camino de Santiago — the 500-mile pilgrimage that ends in northern Spain — after retiring from Morgan Stanley in 2019, this might be his biggest journey yet.Read More:It’s Time for UBS to Take an Axe to Credit SuisseThe Triumph of UBS Is Also the Humbling of Swiss BankingMichael Klein Loses the Deal of His Life in CS First BostonUBS Tells Credit Suisse Bankers: Expect ‘Culture Filter’--With assistance from Ambereen Choudhury, Marion Halftermeyer, Myriam Balezou and Alex Tribou.(Adds comments from annual meeting starting in eighth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekApple’s Complex, Secretive Gamble to Move Beyond ChinaThanks to Putin, Business Is Booming for Germany’s Defense ContractorsThe Undercover Organizers Behind America’s Union WinsA Giant Rail Merger Escapes Washington’s Big Deal CrackdownWhy Cheaper Insulin Today Risks Higher Costs Later©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

""As CMO's across the industry evolve into Chief Experience Officers, their focus is shifting from capturing existing demand to creating new stickiness for a brand in all the ways it interacts with its customers. Only a creative innovation partner with a suite of specialisms aggregated around a single, powerful brand idea, can deliver the total experience those clients need today,"" says Prakash.TBWA has acquired or grown specialisms across all the touchpoints of a brand, derived from the creative capabilities and strengths of the Collective's best-in-class agencies. In fact, over a third of TBWA Asia's revenue today comes from specialisms that didn't exist 3 years ago. Just as with McDonald's tapping the NEXT unit inside TBWA as a Marketing Innovation partner, growth across the Collective has been driven by disciplines that go beyond the confines of traditional communications.Among the products being rolled out globally are:Story continuesNEXT is a cutting-edge innovation practice. It generates, prototypes, develops, and leverages what's new in technology in a brand consistent way to extend clients into new spaces, channels, and experiences.Plex by TBWA helps complex and B2B companies simply and impactfully communicate a brand's value proposition, and brings it to life through marketing, sales enablement, internal communications, events and design.Inside is an offering that interprets a company's brand platform for its most important audience: its employees.

This offering aligns brand strategy and brand marketing with retail/store/social/ecommerce promotions and scaled production.Creating flexibility in operating and remuneration models sits at the heart of this product-focused approach, says Prakash. ""Our industry has, for too long, been working within the confines of a one-size-fits-all, out-of-date model, that is misaligned with the value and impact of our work. We know that to continue to drive the record global growth we have delivered in the past two years for TBWA, we must disrupt the way our industry operates, and ensure that our pricing is commensurate with the value we drive.""TBWA Global CEO, Troy Ruhanen believes the advent of the Chief Product Officer is a key milestone - setting the standard for others to follow, ""As Disruption is our common thread throughout all we do, so must we challenge the conventions in our own industry. Our specialisms have been growing through our brilliant local agencies, now we are applying our collective muscle to making, nurturing and evolving them into the products that will truly deliver for our clients on a global scale. Deepthi embodies the restlessness and energy of TBWA, so is the perfect person to drive this next phase of our evolution.""Deepthi Prakash joined TBWA in February 2020 from Cognizant, where she served as Co-Head of Cognizant Interactive and Global Head of Strategy &amp; Design.

Its nearest rival, SAP is way behind at a market share of around 8%.  About 90% of the Fortune 100 companies uses at least one Salesforce software.The company has leveraged its expertise in on-demand software to increase the scale of operations. It also offers a technology platform for customers and developers to build and run business applications.Salesforce helps companies of every size and industry to connect with their customers in new ways through existing and emerging technologies including cloud, mobile, social, IoT and artificial intelligence (AI).Rapid digital transformation and the company’s sustained focus on introducing more aligned products as per customer needs is driving its revenues higher. Over the last eight years, Salesforce’s annual revenues have sextuple from $5.4 billion in fiscal 2015 to $31.4 billion in fiscal 2023.Story continuesThere are two main revenue streams — Subscription and Support and Professional Services &amp; Other.Subscription revenues comprise subscription fees from customers, accessing the company’s enterprise cloud computing services (Cloud Services), software licenses and subscription fees recognized from customers for additional support beyond the standard support lent by the company. This segment accounted for more than 93% of Salesforce’s fiscal 2023 revenues.Professional Services &amp; Other revenues consist of fees that the company derives from consulting and implementation services and training. This segment accounted for the remaining 7% of Salesforce’s fiscal 2023 revenues.Bottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio requires research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Salesforce.com ten years ago, you're likely feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in April 2013 would be worth $4,468.55, or a 346.86% gain, as of April 3, 2023, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 gained 161.87% and the price of gold went up 21.56% over the same time frame.Analysts are anticipating more upside for CRM.Salesforce is benefiting from a robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. The rapid adoption of its cloud-based solutions is driving demand for its products. Its sustained focus on introducing more aligned products as per customer needs is driving its top-line. Continued deal wins in the international market is another growth driver. The acquisition of Slack would position the company to be a leader in enterprise team collaboration solution space and better compete with Microsoft’s Teams product. We expect CRM revenues to grow at a CAGR of 11.2% through fiscal 2024-2026. However, stiff competition and unfavorable currency fluctuations are concerns. Besides, challenging macroeconomic environment might hurt its growth prospects In the near-term.The stock has jumped 7.16% over the past four weeks. Additionally, no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 19 higher, for fiscal 2023; the consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

76,986dd954-3e57-361a-8f7f-b8cc24afa460,CRM,2023-04-05,Why You Should Avoid Overvalued and Overhyped CRM Stock (For Now),InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-avoid-overvalued-overhyped-crm-160729438.html,1680278849,STORY,['CRM'],"[It may be tempting to invest in customer relationship management (CRM) software specialist Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) right now. Yet, caution is advised, as CRM stock isn’t a bargain at all. It will be difficult for Salesforce to live up to the company’s expectations, especially now that Salesforce is aggressively slimming down.At first glance, it seems like Salesforce is infallible and unstoppable. The company is among the newest additions to the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Also, Salesforce is embedding generative artificial intelligence (AI) into the company’s cloud products (though some people might argue that Salesforce is a latecomer and bandwagon-jumper in this regard).Yet, any stock can be vulnerable to pullbacks, especially after a huge run-up. Before investing in Salesforce, consider the risk-versus-reward profile, as a substantially smaller company might not be able to live up to its own high expectations.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSalesforce’s Chief Executive Acknowledges a MistakeIf anything has shifted the hype surrounding Salesforce into overdrive, it’s the company’s revenue guidance for fiscal 2024. Salesforce expects to generate $34.5 billion to $34.7 billion, up approximately 10% year over year and higher than Wall Street’s consensus estimate of $34 billion.CRM stock jumped from $165 to nearly $190 after the earnings and guidance release. Now, Salesforce has the daunting task of justifying the hype and meeting its own revenue expectations. That’s going to be challenging during a time when some businesses are cutting costs due to elevated inflation and recession fears.Salesforce is also cutting its costs. CEO Marc Benioff admitted that Salesforce “hired too many people” after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic when technology companies were making money hand over fist.Alarmingly, Salesforce’s workforce increased 62% during that hype-fueled time. Now, in 2023, the company is laying off 10% of its staff. It certainly won’t be easy for a significantly smaller Salesforce to live up to its pumped-up revenue expectations.Story continuesSeveral Metrics Indicate CRM Stock Isn’t a Good ValueAnother concern is the valuation of CRM stock. The aforementioned post-earnings share-price rally made the stock even more expensive than it already was.We can drive the point home by applying some old-school but still-relevant valuation metrics. For example, Salesforce’s trailing 12-month (TTM) GAAP price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 906.44x is absolutely outrageous. Bear in mind the median P/E ratio for the sector is 21.95x.Meanwhile, Salesforce’s TTM price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 6.01x is more than double the sector median P/S ratio of 2.68x. In addition, Salesforce’s TTM price-to-cash-flow (P/CF) ratio is 26.73x, versus the sector median P/CF ratio of 19.79x.It’s Wise to Avoid CRM Stock NowGiven the company’s sky-high P/E ratio, it’s sensible to wait for the Salesforce share price to move closer to its 52-week low of $126.34 before taking a position. Otherwise, you might end up on the wrong side of the trade.Besides, Salesforce has to knock it out of the park with stellar revenue stats over the coming year. This will be difficult to achieve with a reduced staff. So, now isn’t the right time to buy CRM stock, as lower prices are likely on the horizon.On the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.David Moadel has provided compelling content – and crossed the occasional line – on behalf of Motley Fool, Crush the Street, Market Realist, TalkMarkets, TipRanks, Benzinga, and (of course) InvestorPlace.com.

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. Although, when we looked at PG&amp;E (NYSE:PCG), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for PG&amp;E:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.031 = US$3.2b ÷ (US$119b - US$16b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Thus, PG&amp;E has an ROCE of 3.1%.  Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Electric Utilities industry average of 4.7%. Check out our latest analysis for PG&amp;E roceIn the above chart we have measured PG&amp;E's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for PG&amp;E.How Are Returns Trending?When we looked at the ROCE trend at PG&amp;E, we didn't gain much confidence. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 4.9% over the last five years. However it looks like PG&amp;E might be reinvesting for long term growth because while capital employed has increased, the company's sales haven't changed much in the last 12 months. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.Our Take On PG&amp;E's ROCEBringing it all together, while we're somewhat encouraged by PG&amp;E's reinvestment in its own business, we're aware that returns are shrinking. And investors appear hesitant that the trends will pick up because the stock has fallen 64% in the last five years. All in all, the inherent trends aren't typical of multi-baggers, so if that's what you're after, we think you might have more luck elsewhere.Story continuesPG&amp;E does have some risks, we noticed   2 warning signs  (and 1 which can't be ignored)  we think you should know about.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Whether it's planting a tree or shrub, gardening or landscaping, repairing or replacing a fence that was damaged during the recent series of storms or removing downed trees, PG&amp;E wants everyone to be safe and urges customers to call 811 before digging to avoid damaging underground utility lines. April is National Safe Digging Month, and an opportunity to raise awareness of this important, free service.Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PRNewsfoto/Pacific Gas and Electric Company)Underground utility lines can be shallow, sometimes only a few inches below the surface, due to erosion, previous digging projects, shifting or settling of the ground and uneven surfaces. And damaging an underground utility line while digging can be expensive, with repairs averaging $3,500. A call to 811 is the best safeguard and the first line of defense to help keep your family and neighbors safe, and to avoid expensive repairs.""Calling 811 is free, easy and fast, and will help you keep your family and neighbors safe and connected to essential utility services. With the stormy weather we've experienced in Central and Northern California this year, many people will be doing fence repair projects or removing downed trees. But, striking an underground utility line while digging can be dangerous and lead to expensive repairs, so please remember to call 811, one free call for all digging projects, large or small,"" said Joe Forline, PG&amp;E senior vice president, gas operations.Warmer weather months see an increase in digging projects, and unfortunately many of those projects are proceeding without a free call to 811 to have underground utilities marked for project sites. In fact, in 2022 throughout PG&amp;E's service area of Northern and Central California:Story continuesThere were 1,635 incidents where homeowners or contractors damaged underground gas or electric lines while digging.In 55 percent of incidents when an underground utility line was damaged due to digging, 811 was not called.For homeowners specifically, that percentage rises to 91 percent.The average cost to repair a damaged utility line is $3,500.Leading causes of damages to underground utility lines while digging include: building or replacing a fence, gardening and landscaping, planting a tree or removing a stump, sewer and irrigation work and building a deck or patio.Calling 811 is Fast and Free: Customers should call 811 a minimum of two business days before beginning any project that involves digging, no matter how large or small. Customers can also visit usanorth811.org to have underground utility lines marked for their project site.Professional utility workers for all utilities (gas, electric, water, sewer and telecommunications) will be dispatched to mark the location of all underground utility lines for the project site with flags, spray paint, or both.The 811 call center serving Central and Northern California, USA North, is staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and will provide Spanish and other translation services.PG&amp;E safe digging tipsMark project area in white: Identify the digging location by drawing a box around the area using white paint, white stakes, white flags, white chalk or even white baking flour.Call 811 or submit an online request a minimum of two working days before digging: Be prepared to provide the address and general location of the project, project start date and type of digging activity. PG&amp;E and other utilities will identify underground facilities in the area for free. Requests can be submitted a maximum of 14 days prior to the start of the project.Dig safely: Use hand tools when digging within 24 inches of the outside edge of underground lines.

According to new survey data from Realtor.com®, recent LGBTQ+ and BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and people of color) buyers are going into homeownership weighed down and more burdened by housing costs than white and non-LGBTQ+ individuals.Lower down payment, higher sales price and loan denials creates cost crunch for communities challenged by lower incomesApril is Fair Housing Month and it creates an opportunity to shine a light on the need to create more equitable housing opportunities and access for all individuals. Realtor.com®'s data shows that LGBTQ+ and BIPOC buyers are more likely to put smaller down payments on a home, with nearly two-thirds (65%) putting down 20% or less of a home's purchase price when buying compared to about half (53%) of white, non-LGBTQ+ buyers. LGBTQ+ and BIPOC buyers were also nearly 9% more likely to pay over a home's asking price to get their offer accepted – 86% paid over asking compared to 79% of white and non-LGBTQ+ individuals.A smaller down payment on top of an above-asking home price generally equates to a higher interest rate and monthly mortgage payment, and that means LGBTQ+ and BIPOC buyers are likely to pay a larger share of their income toward housing than other buyers. That's especially challenging for budgets, as a higher percentage of LGBTQ+ and BIPOC homebuyers were also more likely to fall into lower income groups than white and non-LGBTQ+ buyers. Realtor.com® also found that LGBTQ+ and BIPOC buyers face challenges during the mortgage process, and are 1.7 times more likely to have been denied mortgages two or more times.""More Americans than ever before are stretched thin because of the growing housing cost burden, but our data shows that LGBTQ+ and BIPOC buyers are potentially spending even more of their income to own a home of their own, which can make it difficult to afford other essentials like food and transportation and creates even greater inequalities,"" said Laura Eddy, Realtor.com® vice president, Research and Insights. ""With the rising costs of homeownership taking a greater toll on budgets, resources like down payment assistance can help reduce the overall financial burden of buying a home and make it more accessible to a wider range of individuals.""Story continuesDown payment assistance helps reduce upfront costs of buying a homeTo help address the homeownership disparity in America, Realtor.com® teamed up last year with the Homeownership Council of America to donate to and raise funds for HCA's Equity Down Payment Assistance Fund, which helps make owning a home more accessible for BIPOC and low-to moderate-income homebuyers. Since its inception, the Equity Down Payment Assistance Fund has already helped several buyers close on a home, including Jose, a Mexican-American from the Los Angeles area. Jose is a first-generation homeowner and is proud and excited to be celebrating the magic of many ""first"" experiences, like celebrating the holidays with his daughter for the first time in their own home.""I believe there is a huge problem with the homeownership gap and the effects of those gaps go on for generations,"" said Jose. ""Being the first one in my family to purchase a home is definitely a proud moment – I get choked up thinking about it, because my parents came to this country with a dream. Having a home of my own felt like freedom.""There are 5.37 million Americans who qualify for down payment assistance, according to the Urban Institute, but data from the National Association of Realtors®  shows only 3–4% of recent homebuyers have taken advantage of these programs when buying a home. Realtor.com® aims to raise awareness of down payment assistance programs and other tools to help address the homeownership disparity in America.""At Realtor.com®, we believe the dream of homeownership should be achievable by all, but inequality and a history of discriminatory housing policies have made it harder for BIPOC and LGBTQ+ individuals to overcome housing hurdles, and since housing is a predominant way to build wealth, that's led to a significant wealth gap across generations,"" said Mickey Neuberger, CMO, Realtor.com®. ""Reducing unfair housing cost burdens and giving greater access to communities who have been locked out of homeownership opportunities can help address that gap, and it's why we're joining forces with others in the industry and bringing new tools and resources to more individuals to help lift their financial strain.""To increase awareness of down payment assistance programs and make them more accessible to shoppers, all for-sale home listings on Realtor.com® now include information about down payment assistance under the Monthly Payment section. The tool, also available at Realtor.com/fairhousing, puts information about more than 2,000 programs right at consumers' fingertips, so they can quickly and easily find available local, state or national programs by sharing some basic information. The tool's functionality is provided by Down Payment Resource, whose technology matches buyers with assistance programs that meet their individual home buying needs.To watch a video about Jose's home journey, search for down payment assistance programs, and find more Fair Housing tools and resources from Realtor.com®, visit Realtor.com/fairhousing.MethodologyRealtor.com®  conducted a proprietary online quantitative survey in January 2023 among 7,514 consumers who visited a website or real estate app in the last 12 months and who were a primary or shared decision maker of living situations and had no critical industry affiliations.About Realtor.com®Realtor.com® is an open real estate marketplace built for everyone.

The massive rally was brought in by Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse earlier in March, leading to worries about monetary tightening conditions.Invesco QQQ QQQ, which serves as a proxy to the Nasdaq Index, gained 18.7%. The ETF is powered by investors’ flight to mega-cap, cash-rich technology stocks amid the latest bank turbulence. As such, a few tech names were the real stars, having gained more than 50% in the quarter. These include NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Meta Platforms META, Tesla TSLA, Warner Bros.

These have strong balance sheets, durable revenue streams and robust profit margins, and are, thus, better positioned to withstand a possible economic downturn. These are also set to benefit from a steep drop in bond yields (read: Are Tech ETFs Safe Bets Amid Banking Crisis?).Further, the tech stocks received a boost from the rising risk of a recession, heightened by the recent bank crisis that may prompt the Federal Reserve to stop raising interest rates sooner than expected. The Fed raised interest rates by 25 bps in the latest FOMC meeting but signaled that an end to interest rate increases could be on the horizon.As the tech sector relies on borrowing for superior growth, it is cheaper to borrow more money for further initiatives when interest rates are low. Signs of cooling inflation also bolstered hopes that the Fed might soon end its aggressive interest rate hikes.Let’s take a closer look at the fundamentals of QQQ.QQQ in FocusInvesco QQQ provides exposure to the 101 largest domestic and international non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq.

This move can be attributable to notable volume with a higher number of shares being traded than in a typical session. This compares to the stock's 9.7% loss over the past four weeks.Marathon Oil stock rose for the seventh straight day, driven by optimism over crude prices spurred by the surprise production cut from OPEC. The rally in commodity prices to around $80 a barrel is set to push drilling activity higher and contributed to the strength in the company, which is a leading oil and natural gas exploration and production operator in the United States and Africa.This energy company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.80 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -21.6%. Revenues are expected to be $1.7 billion, down 3% from the year-ago quarter.Earnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.For Marathon Oil, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 15.7% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. And a negative trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't usually translate into price appreciation.

So what was the instigator here, and is $100 a barrel oil on the horizon? Let's discuss this with Blue Line Futures President Bill Baruch and Neal Dingmann, Truist managing director energy research. Good to see you both.Bill, we'll start with you. How much did--NEAL DINGMANN: Thank you.DAVE BRIGGS: --geopolitics play in here, and how much is strictly the price action we've seen in recent weeks and months?BILL BARUCH: You know, I think there's quite a bit going on behind the scenes here. You know, White House didn't fill the SPR where they had a little bit of an opportunity to. Same time, there's a lot in the news right now with China making deals with Saudi Arabia, making deals with Brazil, trying to go around the dollar potentially. You know, there's definitely some just interesting narratives to keep in mind here.For me, what I'm seeing is, you know, we got somewhat negative at the end of last year on oil, its difficulties of trying to get above $82, $83 on a technical basis. Losing the speculators in the market. You saw open interest just continue to erode into the end of last year.And we finally got the flush out. Really a cleansing last week was the bottoming process that really began into last week. A 5% move last week on Monday. Another more than 5% move today. We haven't had a 5% move in oil going back to November, and prior to that was May.So these are big moves here, and I think that cleansing allows, you know, the speculators to start maybe coming back. A little bit reaffirmation now with this move. But we've got to get above $82 to $83. It's been a really big ceiling there. So until that happens, this is just a nice, you know, big, little bounce up, rebound.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: Well, here we are today just above $80, just below $81 a barrel here. Neal, how has this or has this at all changed your price forecast, either for year end or even out into 2024?NEAL DINGMANN: I think it does put a floor on prices. And, you know, I come at it a little bit different angle. I think about, you know, my producers. I cover almost 40-odd names, and what's interesting, I think at one time the US producers were-- I would call them the swing factor when it came to supply out there. And what we've seen is prices were over $90-ish not terribly long ago. Then they recently were down to $60. What I noticed from almost all of my public companies, they're not changing their plans.So I think what the US administration realizes now, as much as they might want it, the US is not going to be that supply-- swing supplier. Unfortunately, now that looks like it is in the hands of OPEC Plus, most specifically Russia and Saudi. And they stepped in and made a big call where, you know, five years ago plus, the US companies probably would have stepped in and made the call themselves. And that, to me, is just no longer going to happen.DAVE BRIGGS: Bill, you referenced the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. What position does this put the White House in in terms of filling that at some point in the near future?BILL BARUCH: You know, I think they're going to be stick the narrative they said about a week-- about a month ago-- I'm sorry-- that they're going to look, you know, in the future. I think they're probably looking out to later this year, potentially, if they get another opportunity.But I do agree, you know, with the gentleman here that he's saying that there's a floor in the market now. And I think looking at it from a technical basis, $75 area was the close on Friday. That's going to be basically that gap. I mean, if it does start selling off, there's an air pocket there.I also agree that you're not seeing production coming back online from the US. They're going to struggle to get above 13 million barrels here in the US. And then on top of that, it's expensive due to, you know, these oil-services companies have raised the cost. You know, just logistically, it's hard to justify bringing it online. And then, you know, these energy companies have become, you know, lauded by investors here with the dividends. So sort of affirming the dividends, and I think that they're looking at it from a different game here now.And these companies, you know, we're very overweight energy. We added Pioneer early last week and bring us up to about 15% weighting in energy right now. And my fear really was some of these E&amp;P companies tethered to that price of oil. If oil wasn't going to rebound, they could sort of languish a little bit lower.But this does get me excited. I still want to see more from the market in the underlying crude oil, but I am excited for this to be a reinvigoration of a bull move.SEANA SMITH: Neal, you mentioned several producer companies that you do cover. Of those, who's best positioned here to benefit from today's news?NEAL DINGMANN: I think, you know, a name that comes to mind right away is Occidental Petroleum. You look at OXY, and the knock was they still had a bit too much leverage. But again, in a market like this where, as Bill said, you probably have a new floor, you know, people don't worry about that. You have Buffett coming in and Berkshire buying a lot of that stock. So OXY seems to be sitting very, very nice.Another one you look today is doing very well is Marathon, MRO. Again, Bill was talking about it. You talk about shareholder return. Marathon bought back almost-- over 15% of their stock last year, and we think they'll buy back almost the same. So you look at it in a two-year period buying back almost a third of your shares, that's hard to beat.And then maybe the last one that we would say is Diamondback Energy. We think they are-- you know, Bill hit a key point, and that was service costs aren't going down. But if you look at FANG, they are by far the lowest operator. We have them at a break even of less than-- right around $30, which is much less than anybody else.So, you know, a time of big-- of higher prices, you don't worry as much about cost. But their margins just hit right to the bottom line, and they're just a fantastic producer.DAVE BRIGGS: Bill, do you have any names? And we talked about a floor there. What about the ceiling by the end of summer? Is $100, $95 as Goldman Sachs suggested, possible?BILL BARUCH: Yeah, I think $100 could be a little bit of a magnet, but I'm not going out on a limb just yet. I've got to see a weekly close above $82, $83. You know, like I said, we are-- You mentioned names. We're 15% weighted energy right now with Chevron, Marathon Petroleum. I mean, we really do like the refiners. You're not seeing Marathon Petroleum benefit so much here today, but, you know, seasonally, gasoline hits a very bullish time at the end of March really into Memorial weekend, and some of these, the refining margins can be a tailwind to some of those. We like Marathon Petroleum.Schlumberger we own as well. We added-- we've had Pioneer for a while. We cut at the end of last year. Just kind of worried about a wash out in the market. We finally got that wash out, and that's why we added Pioneer back.But, you know, from another standpoint, we saw in the futures contract there was a massive short position that was actually-- you know, last week's move was really a lot of short covering early on, confirmed through the Commitment of Traders. So I think, you know, this move here is welcoming fresh buying because the move up from, you know, below $70 to about $75 was majority of short covering. So I think this is inviting the speculation back, and the open interest, as I mentioned early on, was very low.So I think we can get above $82, $83. It's not going to happen overnight. But if we get above there, I think this could really start-- it invites a buying, fresh buying into the market.SEANA SMITH: Bill, what do you think it means for gas prices? Because we're getting into pretty soon, sooner than we know it, getting into the heavy summer driving season. Are we going to see gas prices back above $4 a gallon?BILL BARUCH: You know, I'm not jumping on that limb quite yet, but I think-- I would imagine so. I mean, usually these things run up into June, and they stay sticky through the summer. So, I mean, from the makings of what we're looking at right now, I imagine we're going to see these bump up here for the next couple months.SEANA SMITH: All right, Bill Baruch, Neal Dingmann, always great to have you. Thanks so much.]"

The CMA intends to impose a price control on Airwave, the private mobile radio communications network that Motorola Solutions acquired in 2016, altering a long-term contract that was mutually agreed, duly executed and is still in effect.""Motorola Solutions strongly disagrees with the CMA’s final decision and believes it cannot be justified on competitive, economic or legal grounds. We will appeal the decision.In 2016, the Home Office negotiated and agreed to the fixed price Airwave contracts, which were also provided to the CMA as part of the CMA’s approval of Motorola Solutions’ acquisition of Airwave.

It said it was “particularly concerned” about the US tech firms because of their market position.“High barriers to switching are already harming competition in what is a fast-growing market,” Fergal Farragher, Ofcom’s Director responsible for the Market Study, said in a statement. “We think more in-depth scrutiny is needed.”Ofcom, which also oversees broadcasting, telecommunications and the postal service, opened a probe in October based on concerns that the so-called hyperscale cloud providers — Amazon’s AWS, Microsoft’s Azure, and Alphabet Inc.’s Google Cloud — might limit innovation and growth. They account for four-fifths of revenue in the UK public cloud infrastructure market, which Ofcom said is worth £15 billion ($18.7 billion).The agency said it would refer the cloud infrastructure market to the Competition and Markets Authority for it to carry out a market investigation. Ofcom’s final report on its findings and its decision on the referral will be made before Oct. 5.“We stand ready to carry out a market investigation into this area, should Ofcom determine it is required following the completion of its consultation process,” a CMA spokesperson said.The CMA is currently one of the most high-profile watchdogs probing Microsoft’s $69 billion takeover of Activision Blizzard Inc.

OpenAI did not respond to a Reuters email out of business hours.If Hood sues, it would likely be the first time a person has sued the owner of ChatGPT for claims made by the automated language product which has become wildly popular since its launch last year. Microsoft Corp integrated ChatGPT into its search engine Bing in February.A Microsoft spokesperson was not immediately available for comment.""It would potentially be a landmark moment in the sense that it's applying this defamation law to a new area of artificial intelligence and publication in the IT space,"" James Naughton, a partner at Hood's lawfirm Gordon Legal, told Reuters.""He's an elected official, his reputation is central to his role,"" Naughton said. Hood relied on a public record of shining a light on corporate misconduct, ""so it makes a difference to him if people in his community are accessing this material"".Story continuesAustralian defamation damages payouts are generally capped around A$400,000 ($269,360). Hood did not know the exact number of people who had accessed the false information about him - a determinant of the payout size - but the nature of the defamatory statements was serious enough that he may claim more than A$200,000, Naughton said.If Hood files a lawsuit, it would accuse ChatGPT of giving users a false sense of accuracy by failing to include footnotes, Naughton said.""It's very difficult for somebody to look behind that to say 'how does the algorithm come up with that answer?'"" said Naughton.

(WBA) is a Trending Stock",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-walgreens-boots-130001327.html,1680613201.0,STORY,['WBA'],"[Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this largest U.S. drugstore chain have returned +0% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2% change. The Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry, to which Walgreens belongs, has lost 6.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Walgreens is expected to post earnings of $1.10 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.1%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.50 points to a change of -10.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.76 indicates a change of +5.9% from what Walgreens is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.3%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Walgreens is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for WBA _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Walgreens, the consensus sales estimate of $33.84 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +3.8%. The $135.73 billion and $141.08 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.3% and +3.9%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryWalgreens reported revenues of $34.86 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.3%. EPS of $1.16 for the same period compares with $1.59 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $33.47 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.16%. The EPS surprise was +5.45%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Walgreens is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Walgreens. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But even the best stock picker will only win with some selections. So we wouldn't blame long term Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) shareholders for doubting their decision to hold, with the stock down 44% over a half decade. But it's up 7.7% in the last week. The buoyant market could have helped drive the share price pop, since stocks are up 3.7% in the same period.While the stock has risen 7.7% in the past week but long term shareholders are still in the red, let's see what the fundamentals can tell us. Check out our latest analysis for Walgreens Boots Alliance To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over five years Walgreens Boots Alliance's earnings per share dropped significantly, falling to a loss, with the share price also lower. The recent extraordinary items contributed to this situation. At present it's hard to make valid comparisons between EPS and the share price. But we would generally expect a lower price, given the situation.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthIt's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Walgreens Boots Alliance the TSR over the last 5 years was -32%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 11% in the twelve months, Walgreens Boots Alliance shareholders did even worse, losing 14% (even including dividends). Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 6% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance.

This move outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.37%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.98%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.62%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the coffee chain had lost 0.4% over the past month. This has lagged the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 3.65% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 3.71% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Starbucks as it approaches its next earnings report date. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.77, up 30.51% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $8.39 billion, up 9.88% from the year-ago period.SBUX's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $3.40 per share and revenue of $35.86 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +14.86% and +11.18%, respectively.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Starbucks should also be noted by investors. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Starbucks currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Digging into valuation, Starbucks currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 30.6. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 22.21, so we one might conclude that Starbucks is trading at a premium comparatively.Story continuesIt is also worth noting that SBUX currently has a PEG ratio of 1.77.

Starbucks Workers United, the union organizing Starbucks’ workers, said Rizzo was fired after arriving a few minutes late for work. It claims the firing was retaliation for Rizzo's vocal support of the union.Rizzo was one of the workers who first reached out to labor organizers in 2021 to unionize Starbucks stores. Since then, at least 294 of Starbucks’ 9,000 company-owned U.S. stores have voted to unionize, according to the National Labor Relations Board. Seattle-based Starbucks opposes the unionization effort.Starbucks said Monday that Rizzo was fired for “repeated and substantial violations” of its attendance policy, including one instance where she arrived more than three hours late for a shift. Starbucks said it had documented six instances in which Rizzo missed more than four hours of work.“Our policies exist to maintain a welcoming environment for all partners and customers, and interest in a union does not exempt partners from following policies and procedures that apply to all,” the company said in a statement.Rizzo said in a statement that she will fight to be reinstated.Rizzo's name appears repeatedly in a decision issued last month by a federal labor judge at the NLRB, who ordered Starbucks to reinstate seven fired workers in Buffalo after finding “egregious and widespread misconduct” by the company.Among other things, the judge found that Starbucks was inconsistent in warning Rizzo about tardiness and illegally withheld pay raises for her and other supervisors. Starbucks is appealing that ruling.Starbucks Workers United said two other union supporters in Buffalo and one in Eugene, Oregon, were also fired last week.“Starbucks can fire our leaders, but they cannot stop our movement or stop the public from seeing the truth,” the union said.]"

Rizzo, an organizer at the Genesee Street store—one of the first two Starbucks shops in the US to unionize—is credited with igniting a nationwide labor movement at the Seattle-based coffee chain.Read moreChatGPT is getting more nuancedChina is changing its tune on the mRNA vaccineA fresh idea for gathering remote and hybrid employees togetherIn an email to Quartz, a Starbucks spokesperson cited repeated tardiness as grounds for firing Rizzo, whom they said had accrued a “progressive disciplinary track.” Rizzo, who began working at Starbucks at age 17, stated that she has arrived minutes late to work a few times, according to CNN.The Buffalo firing spree happened just two days after Schultz faced questions from the Senate labor committee, headed by senator Bernie Sanders, about numerous instances of unfair labor practices over the past 18 months. During the hearing, Schultz denied any wrongdoing.“I don’t think it’s a coincidence that two days after Howard Schultz had his ego bruised the way that he did that he started lashing out at Buffalo,” Rizzo said in a CNBC interview.The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has found Starbucks guilty of excluding unionized employees from receiving pay raises, tips, and benefits, as well as refusing to engage in contract negotiations with unionized stores. In March, an NLRB judge ruled that the company violated labor laws hundreds of times in Buffalo, ordering the reinstatement of seven unfairly fired employees.Quotable: Retaliation by Starbucks?“To me, this is payback, and it’s vindictive and retaliatory, and just simple mean-spirited.” –A statement from Richard Bensinger, a union organizer and senior advisor to Starbucks Workers United, in an interview with The Buffalo News Story continuesA change in power at Starbucks, but no change in tuneA recent turnover in executive leadership doesn’t seem to have changed Starbucks’ stance toward union organizing.Last month, Laxman Narasimhan became CEO, succeeding Schultz two weeks ahead of schedule. Workers and investors alike have been curious to see how he will handle the company’s contentious labor track record.Narasimhan made his debut as Starbucks chief at the company’s annual meeting on March 23, while workers in 100 stores across the country staged a strike. In a letter to partners published the same day, he wrote: “We must care for the artists and the theater in the front of our stores, and the factory in the back,” appearing to acknowledge employee grievances.Whether that sentiment translates into action remains to be seen, but the recent firings suggest that Starbucks is sticking with its anti-union stance.Related stories👀 Why does Starbucks want to negotiate with unionized workers in person and not on Zoom?🪧 Starbucks workers welcomed their new CEO with a strike ahead of the company’s annual meeting🔥 Starbucks’ union-busting tactics are facing the heatMore from QuartzThe split of the African plate could gift six landlocked countries a coastlineHow Credit Suisse’s demise strengthens Switzerland’s place in global financeSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Mondelez (MDLZ) earns a Zacks Rank #3 21 days from its next quarterly earnings release on April 25, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.81 a share.Mondelez's Earnings ESP sits at 0.94%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.81 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.80.MDLZ is part of a big group of Consumer Staples stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Sysco (SYY) as well.Sysco, which is readying to report earnings on May 9, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $0.92 a share, and SYY is 35 days out from its next earnings report.For Sysco, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.92 is 0.36%.Story continuesMDLZ and SYY's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

118,33d0ae61-aaaf-3b91-bb99-9ff1f9532c63,ADM,2023-04-05,Investors Heavily Search Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-archer-daniels-130001398.html,1680526801,STORY,['ADM'],"[Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this agribusiness giant have returned -1.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Agriculture - Operations industry, which ADM falls in, has lost 1.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.ADM is expected to post earnings of $1.69 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -11.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.74 points to a change of -14.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.26 indicates a change of -7.1% from what ADM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for ADM.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for ADM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of ADM, the consensus sales estimate of $23.69 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +0.2%. The $99.88 billion and $100.7 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -1.9% and +0.8%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryADM reported revenues of $26.23 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.6%. EPS of $1.93 for the same period compares with $1.50 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $26.22 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.03%. The EPS surprise was +17.68%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.ADM is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ADM. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The more customers spend, the more miles they earn and the more partners pay to airlines.Non-flying activities now account for more than half of all miles earned in major loyalty programs, noted Evert de Boer, managing partner at consulting firm On Point Loyalty, making airlines more resilient to economic swings.The share of revenue generated by loyalty programs shot up to 16% in 2021 from about 12% in 2019 at the big five U.S. carriers - Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines and Alaska Airlines, according to data from consultancy IdeaWorksCompany.People curtailed flying during the pandemic, but still spent on airline loyalty credit cards, said JetBlue vice president Chris Buckner.He and other executives expect that trend to continue if a slowing economy cuts travel demand.""Credit card spending isn't going away,"" Southwest Airlines vice president Jonathan Clarkson said.Delta generated $5.7 billion in cash sales last year from American Express and other partners - equal to 14% of 2022 passenger revenue, according to Reuters calculations.Similarly, American Airline received $4.5 billion in cash payments from its partners including Citi and Barclays - equivalent to 10% of passenger revenue.Carriers are trying to generate even more cash from these programs by signing up new partnerships.United has partnered with companies like anti-virus software provider Norton and home security firm SimpliSafe. Alaska is awarding 50,000 miles to customers for securing housing loans from a mortgage company.

(PMI) (NYSE: PM) released its fourth annual Integrated Report today. Informed by a formal sustainability materiality assessment, the report aims to provide an objective description of the company’s business model, governance and management, strategy, and performance.""Despite its many tests, 2022 was a remarkable year that brought our employees closer and saw us make measurable strides toward achieving our purpose,"" said Jacek Olczak, Chief Executive Officer of PMI. ""We are progressing toward our 2025 aspiration of becoming a majority smoke-free company and ultimately phase out cigarettes. While a transformation of this magnitude and complexity cannot be achieved overnight, we are committed to making it happen as fast as possible. It is through constructive engagement that we will accelerate the pace of meaningful and impactful change and complete our transformation for good.""PMI’s latest Integrated Report communicates the progress the company is making towards achieving its purpose—the company’s statement of purpose articulates PMI’s aim to deliver a smoke-free future by focusing its resources on developing, scientifically substantiating, and responsibly commercializing smoke-free products that are less harmful than smoking, with the aim of completely replacing cigarettes as soon as possible and to evolve in the longer term into a broader lifestyle, consumer wellness, and healthcare company.Building on its ESG framework, PMI developed eight strategies targeting the company’s most pressing areas of impact. To accompany these eight strategies, PMI established 11 goals, which form the basis of its 2025 Roadmap, and 19 key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure progress via its Sustainability Index. Each KPI is also aligned with one of two drivers: product sustainability (11 KPIs) or operational sustainability (8 KPIs).Story continues""Non-financial information is increasingly being used by external stakeholders to assess and compare a company’s performance to others, including the financial community in their analyses and investment decisions. It is key to the integrity of PMI’s reporting that the information and data that we publicly disclose accurately reflect our company’s progress, following clear calculation methods,"" explained Emmanuel Babeau, Chief Financial Officer of PMI.Last year, PMI also published its first ESG KPI Protocol, which includes the definition, methodology, and scope of each of the Sustainability Index’s KPIs to provide measurable, verifiable, consistent, and accurate reporting on progress. In conjunction with its latest Integrated Report, the company is also publishing an updated Protocol that notably accounts for efforts undertaken during 2022 to make these KPIs even more robust.Progress against PMI’s sustainability aspirations continued mostly apace in 2022 as it sought to tackle the impacts of both its products (what it produces) and its operations (how it produces).On the social side of its product impact, the company continued to transform and deliver on its purpose; further, it continued implementation of youth access prevention programs in its direct and indirect retail channels. Mindful of the importance of reducing post-consumer waste, it made progress in implementing take-back programs for its smoke-free devices and consumables and increased its electronic device repair capabilities.Product impactSocial24.9 million: Estimated total adult users of PMI’s smoke-free products (2021: 21.7 m)132.1%: Of net revenues derived from smoke-free products (2021: 29.5%)273: Markets where PMI smoke-free products are available for sale, of which 42% are in low- and middle-income countries (2021: 71, 42%)3USD 10.7 billion: Cumulative investment behind smoke-free products since 2008 (2021: USD 9.2 billion)491%: Of total shipment volume covered by youth access prevention programs in indirect retail channels (2021: 91%)5USD 0.3 billion: Annual net revenue from wellness and healthcare products (2021: USD 0.1 billion)Environmental86%: Recycling rate of IQOS devices returned to centralized recycling hubs (weighted-average percentage of each device that is recycled) (2021: 86%)668%: Of shipment volume covered by markets with anti-littering programs in place for combustible cigarettes8.5%: Of shipment volume covered by markets with smoke-free consumables take-back programs7On the social side of PMI’s operations, the company expanded access to structured lifelong learning offers among PMI employees, published a strengthened commitment to human rights, and completed its sixth and seventh human rights impact assessments, in Brazil and Malaysia. On the environmental side, it continued decarbonizing its direct operations, and its science-based targets were validated for net zero GHG emissions across its value chain by 2040. In conjunction with the UN Biodiversity Conference (COP 15) in December 2022, the company announced new long-term biodiversity and water ambitions and strategies, aligned with the post-2020 biodiversity framework adopted by parties to the convention.Operational impactSocial40.7% Of management positions held by women, exceeding our 2022 target of 40% (2021: 39.7%)7 Human rights impact assessments conducted since 2018 in highest-risk countries (2021: 5)Environmental55% Proportion of tobacco purchased at no risk of net deforestation of managed natural forest and no conversion of natural ecosystems (2021: 37%)Triple A Score from CDP for climate, forest, and water security for the third consecutive yearAs a strong complement to the content and data included in PMI’s 2022 Integrated Report, the company has developed 12 case studies and market stories that showcase impact and highlight how PMI affiliates worldwide drive sustainability. All case studies and market stories are available online in a dedicated section of pmi.com/sustainability.""We recognize the essential need to continue building legitimacy and trust among our stakeholders, who are fundamental to our company’s purpose and can accelerate the pace at which we achieve it,"" said Jennifer Motles, Chief Sustainability Officer at PMI. ""Our latest Integrated Report aims to address their demands for more detailed and comparable information on our risks and performance. As we continue to learn, transform, and discover better ways to develop solutions that have a meaningful impact, we hope our transparency and willingness to engage will spark dialogue with those who can help accelerate our pace of change.""Please visit pmi.com/sustainability to learn more about sustainability at PMI and read the PMI Integrated Report 2022.The preparation of PMI’s Integrated Report 2022 considers guidance of international standards and frameworks, including the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the UN Global Compact (UNGC), the UN Sustainable Development Goals, the IFRS Foundation—including use of its SASB Standards, Integrated Thinking Principles, and Integrated Reporting Framework—and some of the recommendations from the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).Philip Morris International: Delivering a Smoke-Free FuturePhilip Morris International (PMI) is a leading international tobacco company working to deliver a smoke-free future and evolving its portfolio for the long term to include products outside of the tobacco and nicotine sector. The company’s current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products. Since 2008, PMI has invested more than USD 10.5 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies. In November 2022, PMI acquired Swedish Match – a leader in oral nicotine delivery – creating a global smoke-free champion led by the companies’ IQOS and ZYN brands. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized versions of PMI’s IQOS Platform 1 devices and consumables and Swedish Match’s General snus as Modified Risk Tobacco Products (MRTPs). As of December 31, 2022, PMI's smoke-free products were available for sale in 73 markets, and PMI estimates that approximately 17.8 million adults around the world had already switched to IQOS and stopped smoking. Smoke-free products accounted for approximately 32% of PMI’s total full-year 2022 net revenues. With a strong foundation and significant expertise in life sciences, PMI announced in February 2021 its ambition to expand into wellness and healthcare areas and, through its Vectura Fertin Pharma subsidiary, aims to enhance life through the delivery of seamless health experiences.

This change was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.58%. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.59%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 1.54%.Coming into today, shares of the seller of Marlboro and other cigarette brands had lost 2.2% in the past month. In that same time, the Consumer Staples sector gained 2.99%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 2%.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Philip Morris as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be April 20, 2023. On that day, Philip Morris is projected to report earnings of $1.33 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 14.74%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $8.06 billion, up 4.12% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $6.31 per share and revenue of $34.88 billion. These totals would mark changes of +5.52% and +9.81%, respectively, from last year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Philip Morris. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.36% higher within the past month. Philip Morris currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Story continuesInvestors should also note Philip Morris's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 15.51. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 8.59, so we one might conclude that Philip Morris is trading at a premium comparatively.We can also see that PM currently has a PEG ratio of 3.1. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. PM's industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.67 as of yesterday's close.The Tobacco industry is part of the Consumer Staples sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 220, which puts it in the bottom 13% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

127,0f62e0bb-db80-3015-b2b6-647f4ab9c8ee,PM,2023-04-05,J.P. Morgan Says Buy These 2 High-Yield Dividend Stocks — Including One With 9% Yield,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/j-p-morgan-says-buy-141136897.html,1680531096,STORY,"['ET', 'ET-PC', 'ET-PE', 'PM']","[After a rough month from mid-February to mid-March, investors have reason for some positive sentiment in what’s been a highly volatile environment. Since hitting bottom on March 13, the S&amp;P 500 has gained back 6.5%, and is back up to a 7.5% year-to-date gain. Increases have been even more impressive for the NASDAQ index, which rose 17% in Q1 – for its best quarterly performance since 2020.But not so fast, says JPMorgan asset management CIO Bob Michele, who takes a cautious view of the long-term.“You could have a feel-good period, and then the reality of the cumulative and lag catch up and slow the economy down… If we’ve been taught anything this past month, you may see it coming or you may not. You don’t know exactly where it’s going to hit. But once it hits, whatever you own, you own, and you have to hope that you own the stuff that recovers,” Michele opined.JPMorgan’s stock analysts are taking that as a cue to point out solid defensive stock plays to weather a storm.The defensive moves that the JPM analysts are recommending are high-yield dividend stocks, with long histories of keeping up reliable payment streams for dividend investors – and with yields well above average, even approaching 9% or better. Let’s take a closer look.Energy Transfer (ET)We’ll start in the hydrocarbon energy sector, taking a look at a midstream company, Energy Transfer. With a market cap of more than $38 billion, this is one of the largest midstream companies in North America. ET has an asset network that includes nearly 120,000 miles of pipelines for both crude oil and natural gas, in addition to export terminals, fractionators, gathering facilities, processing plants, and storage farms. While the network is centered around the Gulf Coast in Texas and Louisiana, the company also  has a heavy presence in Arkansas and Oklahoma, and its network branches out to Florida, the Mid Atlantic region, and the Great Lakes states.In an interesting development, in late March Energy Transfer entered into a ‘definitive agreement’ for the acquisition of Lotus Midstream, a smaller competitor. The transaction, which is expected to be completed in 2Q23, is worth an estimated $1.45 billion and will add approximately 3,000 miles of pipelines for crude oil gathering and transportation. The additions to ET’s network will spread from the Permian Basin of Texas-New Mexico into Oklahoma.Story continuesIn February, Energy Transfer reported its final quarter of 2022, with somewhat mixed results. The company’s top line revenue figure, of $20.5 billion, was up 10% year-over-year, and operating income rose over the same period from $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. The company’s GAAP EPS came in at 34 cents per share, for a 5-cent y/y gain. On the negative side, however, the revenue figure missed the forecast by $3.31 billion, and the EPS was 3 cents below expectations.Despite the misses, Energy Transfer’s distributable cash flow for 4Q22 rose y/y from $1.6 billion to $1.91 billion, and the company saw fit to bump up its common share dividend for the quarter – paid out on February 21 – by 15% quarter-over-quarter to $0.305. At this rate, the common share div payment annualizes to $1.22 per share and gives a yield of 9.5%, almost 5x the average found on the broader market.In his coverage of Energy Transfer for JPMorgan, analyst Jeremy Tonet describes a firm with a solid position and sound outlook, writing: “ET continues to trade at discounted levels, offering an attractive entry point for long-term investors. While we continue to believe that ET’s dominant franchise, footprint, and full integrations will serve the partnership well over the cycle, we recognize the current industry oversupply in crude oil logistics has led to incentive pricing to secure market share.”“We see a constructive macro backdrop driving new opportunities across ET’s business, particularly with the Mariner East and other NGL projects unlocking highly accretive growth. Most importantly, we see 2023 as a key transition year for ET, with leverage decreasing to a level that enables significantly more return of capital that can force the issue on valuation,” the analyst added.In line with this bullish stance, Tonet gives ET shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating, and his price target of $18 suggests a robust one-year upside potential of 40%. Based on the current dividend yield and the expected price appreciation, the stock has 49.5% potential total return profile. (To watch Tonet’s track record, click here)Powerfully positioned energy companies typically get their fair share of positive Wall Street attention, and ET has 7 positive analyst reviews on file for a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock is selling for $12.83 and its average price target of $16.86 implies a gain of ~31% over  coming year. (See ET stock forecast)Philip Morris International (PM)For our second JPM dividend pick, we’ll be shifting our focus to ‘sin’ stocks – an industry well-known for its reliable, high dividend payments. Philip Morris, a leader in the global tobacco industry, is known for its portfolio of leading cigarette brands. The company owns and markets the Marlboro brand outside of the United States (in the US, Philip Morris USA is a branch of Altria Group), along with its well-known eponymous Philip Morris cigarettes and other labels including L&amp;M, Chesterfield, and Next. Philip Morris is active in 175 markets globally, and boasts that, in most of those markets, it holds the #1 or #2 position by market share.Like many tobacco firms, Philip Morris has sensed which way the prevailing social and political currents are setting, and it is working to diversify its product lines toward a ‘smoke free’ future. In 2021, the company derived 29.1% of total revenues from smoke-free products, a share that increased to 32.1% in 2022. The company’s smoke-free lines include oral smokeless tobaccos meant to provide nicotine without the carcinogens and irritants of smoke, as well as e-vapor products and heated tobacco smoking substitutes. The company has invested more than $10.5 billion into the development of its smokeless tobacco product line.Closing out 2022, Philip Morris reported a top line of $8.15 billion and a diluted EPS of $1.39 per share. Year-over-year, these figures were up from $8.1 billion and $1.37, respectively. Better, from an investor’s perspective, both figure beat forecasts by a wide margin; analysts had been looking for $7.5 billion in revenue and $1.29 in EPS.From a defensive perspective, Philip Morris recently declared a dividend of $1.27 per common share, which is set for payout on April 11. Its annualized rate of $5.08 gives a yield of 5.2%. The company has been reliably paying out quarterly dividends since 2008.Among the bullish is JPMorgan analyst Jared Dinges who lays out a solid case for Philip Morris to post gains going forward on its smokeless product line.“We see Q123 as the low point for PMI growth (-5% CC EPS, full Q1 preview in the note), and believe the recent de-rating of shares provides an attractive entry point ahead of the re-acceleration of the business…. Over the medium to long term, as PMI crosses the threshold to become a majority smokefree company (which we anticipate in 2026), we see scope for valuation multiple expansion with the opportunity to have separate listings for the NGP and Tobacco business at some point, which we believe could create incremental value,” Dinges opined.Looking forward, Dinges quantifies his bullish stance with an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating, and predicts a 12-month upside of 19% through his $116 price target. (To watch Dinges’ track record, click here)Elsewhere on Wall Street, the stock garners an extra 8 Buys, 3 Holds and 1 Sell, for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The average target stands at $112.42, suggesting the shares will climb ~15% higher in the year ahead (See PM stock forecast)To find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks’ Best Stocks to Buy, a tool that unites all of TipRanks’ equity insights.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the featured analysts.

However, COVID-led supply chain disruption might hurt the earnings and cash flows of the industry. Also, rising fuel prices might lead to airlines reducing their order for new aircraft from jet manufacturers, which, in turn, may hurt aerospace-defense equipment stocks, particularly those engaged in commercial aerospace.Nevertheless, notable mergers and acquisitions tend to boost the revenue generation prospects of the industry players. Some key players in this industry that you may keep in your portfolio include Raytheon Technologies, TransDigm Group and Curtiss-Wright.About the IndustryThe Zacks Aerospace-Defense Equipment industry comprises firms that manufacture a wide variety of vital components for the aerospace-defense space, ranging from aerostructures, space shuttles, propulsion systems, aircraft engines, defense electronics, missile and radar systems to flight test equipment, structural adhesives, instrumentation and control systems, communication products and many more.A few of these companies also offer integrated simulation and training services to the U.S. defense force. While the majority of the revenues are generated from the production of the aforementioned accompaniments, the industry players also generate revenues by providing notable aftermarket support and services like maintenance, repair and overhaul activities to aerospace and defense players.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Aerospace-Defense Equipment IndustryNew M&amp;As Instill Hopes: Rising competition has historically prompted industry majors to expand their product lines through small and medium-sized mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As) besides the big mergers witnessed in the industry. In March 2023, AAR Corp. completed the acquisition of the aircraft maintenance, repair and operation (MRO) and fleet management software provider, Trax USA Corp, for $120 million plus up to a $20-million earn-out payment.Story continuesThe acquisition will assist AAR Corp. in scaling up its aftermarket service operations and broadening its product portfolio, thus accelerating its revenue generation prospects. Consolidations such as this should improve economies of scale for the industry as a whole, with the players gaining access to diversified business models.Impressive Air Traffic View Boosts Prospects: World air travel data has been improving. Per a report published by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), in January 2023, global revenue passenger-kilometers (RPKs) increased 67% year over year and were 84.2% of January 2019 levels. Impressively, the U.S. domestic market continued its robust recovery, with domestic RPKs climbing 26.8% year over year and up 3.1% above levels achieved in January 2019.The IATA stated in its latest economic outlook that based on the current recovery momentum, it expects total global RPKs to increase by around 20% in 2023. This makes us optimistic about the near-term growth prospects of aerospace-defense equipment industry stocks, especially those engaged in commercial aviation.Rising Fuel Price May Hurt: Fuel remains one of the main operational cost items for an airline, typically accounting for 20-25% of the industry’s total expenses, as stated by IATA in its latest global outlook. Notably the Russia-Ukraine conflict prompted a sharp rise in world oil price, which returned to above $100/bbl for the first time since 2014. IATA expects oil prices to moderate somewhat over the forecast horizon, easing to around $92 in 2023 from around $102 in 2022.However, such an expected moderate price decline might not be sufficient to boost airlines’ profit. The ongoing recovery in air traffic volumes is projected to push up the airline industry’s fuel bill to around $229 billion in 2023. This might lead to airlines reducing their orders for new aircraft from jet manufacturers like Boeing and Airbus, which, in turn, might result in a decline in demand for products from aerospace equipment manufacturers like TransDigm and Triumph Group.Supply Chain Disruption Poses Risk: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented crisis in the aerospace and defense supply chain. Notably, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) needed to dramatically scale back their capacity to reflect the new realities of the commercial air travel market. Such OEM rate reductions are still affecting the extended commercial aerospace manufacturing supply chain, to some extent, which might result in lower earnings and cash flows for the industry in the near term.Zacks Industry Rank Reflects Bright OutlookThe Zacks Aerospace-Defense Equipment industry is housed within the broaderZacks Aerospace sector. It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #59, which places it in the top 24% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects.

""Despite a weak construction outlook, 36% of survey respondents have a larger backlog now than they did at this time in 2019, and 20% have a 10+% larger backlog.""The survey consisted of 45 professional paint contractors from across the U.S. who spend more than $5,000 annually on paint. About 7% of the survey respondents spend more than $100,000 annually.""This [report] seems to match some of our recent calls with paint contractors who highlighted high 2023 bidding activity and lofty backlogs, particularly in commercial end markets,"" Byrne added. ""The largest contractors ($100+k/yr in paint spend) had the greatest backlogs. This should provide a more favorable volume outlook in the first half for paint suppliers, but with potential contraction in the second half.""The economic vibe from paint demand is one of strength, thinks Bank of America.The findings have direct implications for ""paint stocks,"" Byrne noted:Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW): ""The resilience of pro backlogs bodes favorably for Buy-rated Home Depot and Lowe's, for whom sales to pros comprise about 50% and 30% of their respective totals.""Sherwin-Williams (SHW): ""These data are clearly favorable for the near-term earnings outlook for Sherwin, but we remain Neutral due to a more cautious second half outlook for U.S. residential and commercial construction.""PPG (PPG), Masco (MAS), and Axalta (AXTA): ""We remain Buy-rated on PPG and Axalta due to the auto and refinish exposures. We maintain our Underperform rating on Masco to reflect our view that do-it-yourself (65% of Behr brand sales) paint demand remains under pressure against difficult comparisons.""Craftswoman, painter, and interior designer works at a client's place on March 5, 2015.

The loan would have matured in September 2023.Goldman Sachs and Vista declined to comment. Citrix and Evergreen did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The market for junk-rated debt had largely shut down following the failures last month of U.S. regional banks Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and the forced sale of Credit Suisse Group AG to Swiss peer UBS Group AG.Issuance of junk bonds in the U.S. dropped from $13.9 billion in February to $4.45 billion in March, according to Informa, as the market turmoil soured the risk appetite of investors.The sale marks the last chunk of Citrix buyout debt on banks' books, according to one of the sources. A steep rise in interest rates had made it difficult for banks to sell that debt.Banks are also expected to market to investors a portion of the $5.4 billion in debt which last year financed auto parts supplier Tenneco's buyout by Apollo Global Management.

This was the first time Goldman missed out on the top spot since the first quarter of 2019, according to Refinitiv.In Dealogic's global league tables, however, Goldman claimed the top spot in the first quarter with $120.5 billion worth of deals. JPMorgan came second with $120.1 billion worth of deals.While the league table numbers produced by Dealogic and Refinitiv have slight differences every quarter, it is rare for them to produce different winners for the No. 1 spot.Winning the top spot is a coveted prize for investment banks, which monitor league tables closely and use them as a marketing tool to attract clients and hire and retain talent. The discrepancies led to Goldman asking Refinitiv and JPMorgan asking Dealogic for explanations, according to people familiar with the conversations.A spokesperson for ION Analytics, the parent company of Dealogic, said that its methodology is based on feedback it receives from the market, and declined to comment on the origin of the discrepancies.""The methodology has been refined continuously over three decades of collaboration with market participants,"" the spokesperson said.Matt Toole, director of Refinitiv Deals Intelligence, a London Stock Exchange Group Plc company, said that the data vendor took market feedback onboard and was open to making adjustments when it is merited.""There is a process in place there that can't be unduly influenced because otherwise that breaks the whole trust factor,"" Toole said.Story continuesSpokespeople for Goldman and JPMorgan declined to comment.It is not clear what caused the discrepancies that led to Goldman and JPMorgan both claiming the No. 1 spot, though there are some known differences in how the league tables of Refinitiv and Dealogic are compiled.Refinitiv, for example, counts the consolidation of two or more classes of stock as an M&amp;A transaction, whereas Dealogic does not. Dealogic registers a spin-off transaction at the time it is announced, whereas Refinitiv takes note of it at the time when the spun-off company starts trading, which can be several quarters later.Refinitiv and Dealogic agreed on who came on top in their legal advisor deal league table rankings in the first quarter of 2023 -- M&amp;A powerhouse Sullivan &amp; Cromwell LLP.(Reporting by Anirban Sen in New York; Editing by Greg Roumeliotis and Andrea Ricci)]"

They had a deadline of April 4 to disclose data for the year up to April 2022.Several major finance companies also voluntarily reported ethnicity pay data for the period.HSBC - already one of the most unequal banks in Britain in terms of gender pay - reported a wider mean average gap for the year, disclosing women were paid 45.2% less than men. This was up from 44.9% the prior year.The British arm of Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs' gap increased to 53.2% - remaining the largest among major finance employers reviewed by Reuters and up from 51.3% the prior year.Morgan Stanley's UK arm's gap widened to 40.8%, up from 40.5%, while Standard Chartered's gap increased to 29% from 27%.All four banks said in their gender pay gap reports that the figures reflected the under-representation of women in senior roles and that they were taking steps to address this.""I assure you that we are intent on changing this, but of course it takes time,"" Richard Gnodde, CEO of Goldman Sachs International, wrote in a memo to staff on Tuesday.The majority of major finance firms nonetheless made progress in narrowly closing their gender pay gaps, according to their disclosures.The average across 20 of the biggest employers decreased to 30.1% in 2022, compared to 31.7% the prior year.Story continuesBut this gap remains way above the average across all UK employers of 8.3%, according to official data.""Organisations think and say they're doing the right thing to advance gender equality in the workplace - but when it comes to taking action ... they are failing to deliver,"" said Ann Francke, CEO of the Chartered Management Institute.Experts say that while the gender pay gap data is a blunt tool for measuring disparities - as it does not reflect gaps at the same level of seniority, for example - it can capture broad inequities and affect change.ETHNICITY PAY GAPSHalf of the 20 finance firms reviewed reported varying detail on ethnicity pay gaps, with some including insurer Phoenix doing so for the first time.The largest overall ethnicity pay gap disclosed was by UBS at 23%, although this had improved from 24% the prior year. Where data was available across two years, overall ethnicity pay gaps narrowed at the majority of firms.Where pay gaps were further broken down by ethnicity, they showed the largest pay disparities were between Black and white employees. The widest gap was Deutsche Bank's at 38.4%, though this narrowed slightly on the prior year.The pay gap between Black and white staff increased at both HSBC and Barclays - to 24.8% from 22.9% and to 19.6% from 19.2% respectively.All the employers said in their pay gap reports they were taking steps to improve diversity, particularly at senior levels.Other firms with disclosures reviewed by Reuters included Lloyds, NatWest, Bank of America, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse, and Aviva, M&amp;G, Admiral, Legal &amp; General, abrdn, St James's Place and Schroders.(Reporting by Iain Withers, additional reporting by Simon Jessop, Editing by Tommy Reggiori Wilkes and Mark Potter)]"

On average, the median net wealth of Black households is 85% less than that of white households. When looking at single Black women, their median net wealth is 92% less than that of single white men. Reducing the earnings gap for Black women would not only empower an entire demographic, but has the potential to raise the U.S. annual GDP by as much as 2.1%—or $525 billion.You can learn more about the Goldman Sachs One Million Black Women Initiative here, and by reading the latest report, Investing in Black Women: Building a More Inclusive Economy.About the One Million Black Women InitiativeIn partnership with Black-women-led organizations, financial institutions and other partners, Goldman Sachs has committed $10 billion in direct investment capital and $100 million in philanthropic capital over the next decade to address the dual disproportionate gender and racial biases that Black women have faced for generations, which have only been exacerbated by the pandemic. The initiative, One Million Black Women, is named for and guided by the goal of impacting the lives of at least one million Black women by 2030. Goldman Sachs’ research Black Womenomics has shown that sustained investments in Black women will catalyze economic growth, making for not only a fairer, but also a richer society.About Goldman SachsGoldman Sachs is a leading global financial institution that delivers a broad range of financial services to a large and diversified client base that includes corporations, financial institutions, governments and individuals.

It is worth considering Schlumberger (SLB), which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry.This world's largest oilfield services company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 8.72%.For the last reported quarter, Schlumberger came out with earnings of $0.71 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.69 per share, representing a surprise of 2.90%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.55 per share and it actually produced earnings of $0.63 per share, delivering a surprise of 14.55%.Price and EPS SurpriseWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Schlumberger. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Schlumberger currently has an Earnings ESP of +3.12%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on April 21, 2023.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Schlumberger's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Schlumberger How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Schlumberger is:19% = US$3.5b ÷ US$18b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.19 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Schlumberger's Earnings Growth And 19% ROETo start with, Schlumberger's ROE looks acceptable. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 9.3% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. Probably as a result of this, Schlumberger was able to see a decent growth of 15% over the last five years.Given that the industry shrunk its earnings at a rate of 4.0% in the same period, the net income growth of the company is quite impressive.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for SLB? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Schlumberger Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?With a three-year median payout ratio of 27% (implying that the company retains 73% of its profits), it seems that Schlumberger is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees respectable amount growth in its earnings and pays a dividend that's well covered.Additionally, Schlumberger has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 25%. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 23%.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that Schlumberger's performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. On studying current analyst estimates, we found that analysts expect the company to continue its recent growth streak.

IQDF is managed by Flexshares. This particular fund seeks to match the performance of the Northern Trust International Quality Dividend Index before fees and expenses.The Northern Trust International Quality Dividend Index is designed to provide exposure to a high-quality income-oriented portfolio of long-only international securities issued by non-U.S.-based companies, with an emphasis on long-term capital growth and a targeted overall beta that is similar to that of the Northern Trust International Large Cap Index.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor. And, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Story continuesAnnual operating expenses for IQDF are 0.47%, which makes it on par with most peer products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 4.71%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Looking at individual holdings, Royal Bank Of Canada Common Stock Cad 0 (RY) accounts for about 2.87% of total assets, followed by Bhp Group Ltd (BHP) and Roche Holding Ag Common Stock Chf 0 (ROG).Performance and RiskThe ETF has gained about 7.24% so far this year and is down about -3.14% in the last one year (as of 04/03/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $17.72 and $24.35.The fund has a beta of 0.85 and standard deviation of 17.59% for the trailing three-year period, which makes IQDF a medium risk choice in this particular space. With about 268 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesFlexShares International Quality Dividend ETF is not a suitable option for investors seeking to outperform the World ETFs segment of the market. Instead, there are other ETFs in the space which investors should consider.FlexShares International Quality Dividend Defensive ETF (IQDE) tracks Northern Trust International Quality Dividend Defensive Index and the FlexShares International Quality Dividend Dynamic ETF (IQDY) tracks Northern Trust International Quality Dividend Dynamic Index. FlexShares International Quality Dividend Defensive ETF has $34.05 million in assets, FlexShares International Quality Dividend Dynamic ETF has $112.96 million. IQDE has an expense ratio of 0.47% and IQDY charges 0.47%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the World ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

153,6de87ad1-915b-378e-a004-a9eb5596074f,AIG,2023-04-05,Reasons to Hold American International (AIG) Stock for Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/reasons-hold-american-international-aig-153303151.html,1680535983,STORY,['AIG'],"[American International Group, Inc. AIG is well-poised to grow on the back of strong General Insurance business, improving renewal retention and new business growth. Moreover, divestitures are helping the company to streamline its business and enhance capital allocation.AIG is a leading global insurance organization providing a wide range of property casualty insurance, life insurance, retirement solutions and other financial services.Zacks Rank &amp; Price PerformanceAmerican International currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). In the past six months, the stock has shed less value than its industry. The company’s shares have declined 2.6% in the past six months compared with the industry’s decline of 5.2%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOptimistic Growth ProjectionsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for AIG’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $6.22 per share, indicating a 36.7% increase from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus mark for 2023 revenues is pegged at $48.6 billion, indicating a 7% increase from the year-ago reported figure.Decent Surprise HistoryThe company beat earnings estimates in three of the past four quarters, while it missed on the other occasion, the average surprise being 6.9%.Business TailwindsIn 2022, a significant portion of AIG’s total revenues came from premiums, which improved 2% from 2021. The figure is expected to grow further in the future due to rate increases.AIG experienced strong rate increases in the last quarter of 2022, which contributed to the upside. Lexington’s property portfolio also saw a similar increase in rates, which will aid margin expansion in the future.The General Insurance segment accounted for 60.6% of total revenues in 2022. This segment delivered strong results in 2022 owing to Lexington and Glatfelter’s improving performance. Lexington, AIG’s market-leading excess and surplus lines business, grew 18% in net premiums written and increased underwriting profitability. This resulted from the transition into the wholesale market, which is expected to drive revenues in the future. Global Specialty also performed well, driven by better client retention, rate increases and business growth.Story continuesAIG experienced a softer net investment income in 2022 due to lower alternative investment income on private equity investments, mortgage prepayment fees, bond calls and tender premiums. However, the current rising interest rate environment should provide an impetus to growth in net investment income.In order to take advantage of higher interest rates, AIG has repositioned its General Insurance portfolio to gain higher yields but remains careful about maintaining credit quality and duration. This is likely to result in higher net investment income in 2023.AIG’s underwriting income increased more than $1 billion in 2022 owing to its underwriting excellence. The General Insurance accident year combined ratio improved 230 basis points (bps), highlighting improved underwriting profitability. The Global Commercial business also contributed with an improvement of 460 bps year over year.American International delivered well on its AIG 200 savings objective. It was supposed to achieve $1 billion in exit run-rate savings by 2022-end. Notably, the target was met six months ahead of schedule. This has helped the company streamline and upgrade its technology infrastructure and operations. Moreover, with Corebridge’s deconsolidation, AIG plans to reduce its expenses by $300 million.AIG has always been on the lookout to improve the performance of its investments. Keeping this in mind, the company has partnered with BlackRock and Blackstone, revamping its investment management strategies and structures. The company has also benefited from BlackRock and Blackstone’s investment expertise and technology platforms, which is expected to reap benefits in the form of improved performance in the future.The company returned $6.1 billion to its shareholders through dividends and share buybacks in 2022, reflecting its balanced capital management strategy.Key ConcernAIG has a high leverage ratio which is a concern. Its net debt-to-capital of 11.9% at 2022-end was significantly higher than the industry’s average of 6.2%. Also, American International’s return on equity of 7.7% is lower than the industry average of 8.8%. This reflects AIG’s relative inefficiency in utilizing its shareholders’ funds to generate profits. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will drive growth in the long term.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the multi line insurance space are Goosehead Insurance, Inc GSHD, CNO Financial Group, Inc.

Through partnership, the companies will distribute screening kits to communities at higher risk of colon cancer.The recent development is likely to bolster LabCorp Diagnostics business.More on the NewsThe Conference of National Black Churches will distribute over 3,000 colorectal screening test kits across several urban and rural locations to promote awareness and offer expanded access to colorectal cancer screening tests, including Atlanta, Dallas, Memphis, Washington D.C., New Haven, Los Angeles and Richmond.Patients can ask for the kit from their provider or can buy from Labcorp's Colorectal Cancer At-Home Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) through Labcorp OnDemand. FIT is a less invasive option for average-risk individuals that is intended to screen for early-stage colon cancer. This makes it convenient for patients to complete a screening test from their homes.New Pact to Enhance Colon Testing AccessThe partnership will increase access to testing options in urban and rural communities and will help LabCorp’s commitment to align health equity with its mission of helping the communities. Moreover, access to regular screening for chronic diseases like colorectal cancer is essential for improving quality of life.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchA projected 90% of colon cancer deaths are preventable if detected early, making it vital for patients to discuss the risk with their providers and to get screened for colon cancer.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Mordor Intelligence, the colorectal cancer screening market was valued at $12,866 million in 2021, and it is expected to register a CAGR of 7.45% by 2028.

Excluding COVID testing revenue, enterprise base business revenue grew 6% in the fourth quarter at a constant exchange rate or CER. Growth in diagnostics-based business revenue in the fourth quarter was strong due to routine and esoteric testing and revenues from the Ascension partnership. The Diagnostic business is expected to accelerate banking on 10.5% to 12.5% base business growth, benefiting by around 5 percentage points with a full year of Ascension partnership.In Oncology, another high-growth area, LabCorp continues to expand oncology capabilities to serve clinicians and drug development customers.

Robust contributions from the Vascular Closure business also seem promising.In the past year, the company’s shares have outperformed its industry. The stock has gained 36.6% against the industry’s 38.8% fall.

The company has an earnings growth rate of 10% for the next five years.With solid prospects, this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock is an attractive pick for investors at the moment.What Makes the Stock an Attractive Pick?Potential Upsides of Plasma Franchise: Haemonetics has been witnessing strong growth in the Plasma franchise for quite some time. In the global plasma market, Haemonetics holds 80% share approximately.  Haemonetics is witnessing plasma market growth above historic rates, driven by an industry striving to double collections by 2025 and the rising demand for plasma-based medicines. The company continued to benefit from the NexSys device and NexLynk donor management software (DMS) backed by increased customer adoptions.Plasma revenues increased 42% in the third quarter. North American disposables represent 85% of total plasma revenues and increased 46% in the quarter, driven by strong growth in volume and price due to technology upgrades.

Growth in North America, the company’s largest market, was 16% in the quarter, driven by strong adoption and utilization of TEG disposables.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe recently-acquired Vascular Closure business continues to excel, with revenues growing 33% in the fiscal third quarter. Growth in the third quarter can be attributed to the new electrophysiology account within the top 600 hospitals. During the third quarter, the company received CE mark certification for Vascade and Vascade MVP, which helped unlock additional attractive market opportunities outside the United States. During the third-quarter earnings update, the company noted that as it progresses with commercialization in Europe, it plans to use a direct sales model and leverage its existing back-office infrastructure. This is one of many investments Haemonetics are making to solidify its leadership position in Vascular Closure and accelerate revenue growth.Recovery Across Businesses: The fiscal third quarter saw the encouraging performance of Haemonetics’ businesses. The Hospital business’ revenues grew 11.3% (up 14.4% on an organic basis) in the reported quarter, despite continued macroeconomic challenges, including hospital staffing shortages, budgetary constraints and COVID-related challenges in China. The company’s revenues and market share rose significantly. Under the Hospital segment, revenue growth in the Hemostasis Management and Vascular Closure product lines was 4.2% and 32.6% on a year-over-year basis, respectively. Within Vascular Closure, growth in the third quarter was driven by converting new electrophysiology accounts from the top 600 hospitals, further increasing its penetration and market share in the United States. Plasma revenues increased 42% in the third quarter, driven by strong growth in collection volume and price due to the technology upgrades.Estimate TrendIn the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Haemonetics’ 2024 earnings has been constant at $2.94.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $1.19 billion, suggesting a 3.5% rise from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

157,790a9835-6d72-3872-9d45-e0518a640cea,HOLX,2023-04-05,3 Reasons to Retain AMN Healthcare (AMN) Stock in Your Portfolio,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-reasons-retain-amn-healthcare-162304602.html,1680625384,STORY,['HOLX'],"[AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. AMN is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its broad array of services. A solid fourth-quarter 2022 performance and its healthcare Managed Services Program (""MSP"") raise optimism regarding the stock. However, healthcare industry regulations and the consolidation of healthcare delivery units are major downsides.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 17.4% compared with a 29.9% decline of the industry and an 9.8% fall of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned player in the healthcare total talent services space has a market capitalization of $3.41 billion. The company projects 3.3% growth for the next five years and expects to witness continued improvements in its business. AMN Healthcare surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an earnings surprise of 10.9%, on average. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Let’s delve deeper.Broad Array of Services: We are upbeat about the company's business’ gradual evolution beyond traditional healthcare staffing. AMN Healthcare has become a strategic total talent solutions partner for its clients. The company’s suite of healthcare workforce solutions includes MSPs, vendor management systems and medical language interpretation services.On the fourth-quarter earnings call in February, management confirmed that the company is continuing to invest in Digital First initiatives, such as AMN Passport.Healthcare MSP: AMN Healthcare’s unique MSP is helping it gain market traction. Notably, the program helps streamline the entire workforce planning process, which facilitates the delivery of improved patient care. This has resulted in a large network of improved patient care and efficiency.In 2022, AMN Healthcare had $5.3 billion in spend under management through its MSPs, and approximately 64% of its consolidated revenues flowed through MSP relationships.Strong Q4 Results: AMN Healthcare recorded robust performance across the majority of its core segments in the fourth quarter of 2022. Management confirmed that high vacancies and voluntary turnover in healthcare are continuing to support the demand for AMN Healthcare’s total talent solutions. The expansion of the gross margin bodes well.Story continuesDownsidesHealthcare Industry Regulations: The healthcare industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state laws and regulations. AMN Healthcare provides talent solutions and technologies on a contractual basis to its clients who pay the company directly. Accordingly, Medicare, Medicaid and insurance reimbursement policy changes generally do not directly impact the company. Nevertheless, reimbursement changes in government programs, particularly Medicare and Medicaid, can and do indirectly affect the demand and the prices paid for the company’s services.Consolidation of Healthcare Delivery Units: Healthcare delivery organizations are consolidating, giving them greater leverage in negotiating service pricing. Consolidations may also result in AMN Healthcare losing its ability to work with certain clients because the party acquiring or consolidating with its client may have a previously established service provider they opt to maintain.Estimate TrendAMN Healthcare has been witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for 2023 over the past 90 days. In the same timeframe, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings per share has moved 1.8% south to $8.28.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $1.11 billion, suggesting a 28.6% decline from the year-ago reported number.This compares to our first-quarter revenue estimate of $1.10 billion, suggesting a 29% plunge from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

158,19d48cb0-973c-3b96-bc8e-ac0653328c9c,HOLX,2023-04-05,Masimo's (MASI) New FDA Clearance to Boost Patient Monitoring,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/masimos-masi-fda-clearance-boost-161004476.html,1680624604,STORY,['HOLX'],"[Masimo Corporation MASI announced that the FDA granted a De Novo to Masimo Opioid Halo, an opioid overdose prevention and alert system. This makes it the first and only FDA-cleared monitoring solution for detecting opioid-induced respiratory depression (slowed or stopped breathing), which is currently the leading cause of death from an opioid overdose.The De Novo authorizes Opioid Halo to be made available over the counter without a prescription for patients aged 15 and up and with prescription from a healthcare provider.The latest regulatory grant is a major stepping stone for Masimo’s real-time patient monitoring business and is likely to solidify its position in the niche space on a global scale.Significance of the GrantPer estimates provided by Masimo, opioid overdose is the key cause of accidental death in the United States presently from both illicit opioids (such as fentanyl and heroin) and prescription opioids. Many suffer non-fatal overdose events or the loss of a close one to opioids.Currently, opioids are readily prescribed in the United States as they can effectively help people manage pain, including after surgery or for chronic conditions. However, opioids  carry severe side effects, especially opioid-induced respiratory depression. Anyone taking opioids, prescription or illicit, is at risk of experiencing an accidental overdose, the signs of which are unpredictable and can be difficult to detect.Opioid Halo is expected to advance the forefront of continuous monitoring through its Opioid Halo engine, an advanced pattern recognition algorithm that aids in detecting and quantifying the risk of severe opioid-induced respiratory depression. Opioid Halo, together with its innovative distributed architecture, aids in managing and sending escalating alarms to caregivers, notifying them that help may be needed due to an opioid overdose. This includes triggering an automatic wellness call, which may lead to emergency medical services being dispatched.Story continuesPer management, Opioid Halo is expected to help make a big difference by providing a much-needed tool that can help millions, whether they are taking prescribed opioids or struggling with illicit opioid use.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Allied Market Research, the global patient monitoring devices market was estimated to be $25,768.56 million in 2019 and is anticipated to reach $44,861.56 million by 2027, seeing a CAGR of 4.4%. Factors like technological advancements and growing preference for telehealth services are expected to drive the market.Given the market potential, the FDA granting a De Novo to Masimo Opioid Halo is likely to provide a significant boost to Masimo’s business globally.Recent DevelopmentsLast month, Masimo unveiled the latest addition to its wearable product line — the Masimo Freedom smartwatch.The same month, Masimo announced the findings of a prospective study published in Pediatrics International. The research relates to the ability of non-invasive, continuous Masimo pleth variability index and other dynamic parameters to predict fluid responsiveness in children of one to three years of age who were undergoing major neurosurgery.In March, Masimo entered a strategic innovation collaboration with Philadelphia-based Temple Health.Price PerformanceShares of Masimo have gained 27.8% in the past year against the industry’s 16.8% decline and the S&amp;P 500's 9.8% fall. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Zacks Rank &amp; Other Key PicksCurrently, Masimo flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

159,c621b8db-f391-3462-a903-8f13f1a13a11,HOLX,2023-04-05,Bet on 5 High ROE Stocks as Markets Shrug Off Oil Output Cut,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bet-5-high-roe-stocks-105910593.html,1680605950,STORY,['HOLX'],"[The U.S. equity markets witnessed a continued uptrend over the past couple of trading sessions despite a production cut by OPEC+ oil cartel, which includes OPEC members plus Russia. With higher global inventories and falling oil prices due to market uncertainty and the banking sector crisis, the reduction in oil output was in the cards. Although the decrease in daily production by 1.16 million barrels has led to a surge in oil prices, experts widely believe that this would result in a subdued growth in oil demand with even a likely supply deficit later this year.In addition, this is likely to fuel inflationary pressures and make the job harder for the Fed to hit the pause button on the rate hike program. The Fed had indicated that there might be just another hike in the current year after the recent quarter basis points (bps) hike in the interest rate, as tightening credit conditions could put pressure on the economy. However, equity markets appear to shrug off this pessimism with a steady string of gains.     As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they can benefit from “cash cow” stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. AutoNation, Inc. AN, Suzano S.A. SUZ, Valero Energy Corporation VLO, Hologic, Inc. HOLX and Ryder System, Inc. R are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.Why ROE?ROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Story continuesScreening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash-rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow lesser than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for $1 of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow-generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 20 stocks that qualified the screen:AutoNation: Incorporated in Delaware in 1991, AutoNation is the largest automotive retailer in the United States. Apart from retailing new and used vehicles, the company offers vehicle maintenance and repair services, vehicle parts, extended service contracts, vehicle protection products and other aftermarket products. In addition, it arranges financing for vehicle purchases through third-party sources.It has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 3.5% and delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 4.8%, on average. It has a VGM Score of B. Currently, AutoNation carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Suzano: Headquartered in Salvador, Brazil, Suzano produces and sells eucalyptus pulp and paper products. With more than 90 years of experience, this vertically integrated firm is one of the largest producers of paper and graphic products in South America.   Suzano has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 6.9% and delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 53.8%, on average. It has a VGM Score of B. It sports a Zacks Rank #1.   Valero Energy: San Antonio, TX-based Valero Energy is the largest independent refiner and marketer of petroleum products in the United States. The company was founded in 1980.

PACB, popularly known as PacBio, is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its slew of strategic deals over the past few months. The optimism led by a solid fourth-quarter 2022 performance, along with its product development activities, is expected to contribute further. However, stiff competition and production bottlenecks persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 11% against the 16.9% decline of the industry and 11.3% fall of the S&amp;P 500.This renowned global provider of sequencing systems has a market capitalization of $2.86 billion. The company projects 10.1% growth for 2023 and expects to maintain a strong performance. PacBio’s projected sales growth of 34.8% is favorable compared with the industry’s 9%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Strategic Deals: We are optimistic about PacBio’s robust growth opportunities via its inking of a slew of strategic deals over the past few months. In January, the company announced a collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Graduate School of Medicine, to study the use of long-read sequencing and novel bioinformatics methods to better understand the genetic causes of certain rare diseases in individuals and cohorts within the Japanese population.The company, in December 2022, announced that its HiFi sequencing technology would be used in a pilot project for the Children’s Rare Disease Cohorts Initiative at Boston Children’s Hospital.Product Development Activities: We are optimistic about PacBio's solid potential in the RNA-sequencing market, which has been fortifying the company’s footprint worldwide. In March, PacBio announced new workflows developed with global agriculture company, Corteva Agriscience, enabling high throughput plant and microbial genome sequencing.On the fourth-quarter 2022 earnings call in February, PacBio’s management confirmed that it expects to witness many Sequel II and IIe users to migrate to Revio during 2023.Story continuesStrong Q4 Results: PacBio saw a robust increase in its Consumables revenues during the fourth quarter of 2022. Robust performance in the Asia-Pacific region was also seen. Continued strong prospects for the company’s Revio and Onso systems, with customers placing orders, were also recorded. The recent launch of the Paraphrase tool, confirmed during the fourth-quarter earnings call, augurs well.DownsidesProduction Bottlenecks: PacBio must successfully manage new product introductions and transitions, including the Single Molecule, Real-Time Cell 8M and Sequel II/IIe Systems. However, the company may incur high costs during these transitions, which may not result in the anticipated benefits.Stiff Competition: PacBio operates in a highly competitive market where its competitors offer nucleic acid sequencing equipment or consumables. Many of these companies currently have greater resources and may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than PacBio to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements.Estimate TrendPacBio has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. Over the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its loss per share has narrowed from $1.32 to $1.24.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s first-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $35.2 million, suggesting a 6.1% uptick from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.This compares to our first-quarter revenue estimate of $34.7 million, suggesting a 4.6% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 8th of June to $2.13. This makes the dividend yield 3.4%, which is above the industry average. Check out our latest analysis for Amgen Amgen's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsIf the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much. The last dividend was quite easily covered by Amgen's earnings. This indicates that quite a large proportion of earnings is being invested back into the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 16.6%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 63% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendAmgen Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.44 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $8.52. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 19% a year over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Amgen has impressed us by growing EPS at 35% per year over the past five years. The company doesn't have any problems growing, despite returning a lot of capital to shareholders, which is a very nice combination for a dividend stock to have.Amgen Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable.

Amgen (AMGN), which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This world's largest biotech drugmaker has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 3.67%.For the last reported quarter, Amgen came out with earnings of $4.09 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.04 per share, representing a surprise of 1.24%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $4.43 per share and it actually produced earnings of $4.70 per share, delivering a surprise of 6.09%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor Amgen, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Amgen currently has an Earnings ESP of +14.54%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Regeneron (REGN) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $10.13 a share, just 29 days from its upcoming earnings release on May 3, 2023.Regeneron's Earnings ESP sits at 6.78%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $10.13 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.49.REGN is one of just a large database of Medical stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Amgen (AMGN).Amgen is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on April 26, 2023. AMGN's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $4.50 a share 22 days from its next earnings release.Amgen's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 14.54% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.93.Story continuesREGN and AMGN's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

But in any diversified portfolio of stocks, you'll see some that fall short of the average. For example, the Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (NYSE:PEG) share price return of 33% over three years lags the market return in the same period. Unfortunately, the share price has fallen 11% over twelve months.Since the stock has added US$1.6b to its market cap in the past week alone, let's see if underlying performance has been driving long-term returns. View our latest analysis for Public Service Enterprise Group To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During three years of share price growth, Public Service Enterprise Group moved from a loss to profitability. So we would expect a higher share price over the period.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Public Service Enterprise Group has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Public Service Enterprise Group's TSR for the last 3 years was 48%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's never nice to take a loss, Public Service Enterprise Group shareholders can take comfort that , including dividends,their trailing twelve month loss of 8.0% wasn't as bad as the market loss of around 11%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 8%, each year, over five years. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

The most active timespread for Dubai swaps jumped to above $1 a barrel in backwardation, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd, outperforming the Brent curve.While OPEC+’s production cuts will take effect only next month, Dubai’s strength reflects expectations that the reductions will strengthen an already-robust market for Middle Eastern supplies. Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the UAE and Kuwait pledged to cut a combined 980,000 barrels a day of output, with generally heavier and more sulfurous crude as the bulk of their production.That’s likely to lift the relative value of Dubai crude — which is both a proxy for Middle Eastern oil markets as well as medium-sour oil varieties — against global benchmarks such as Brent even further, a shot in arm for long-haul cargo flows from the Atlantic Basin and Americas into Asia.Even prior to the OPEC+ cuts, traders were already bullish on Dubai versus other crudes, as red-hot Chinese demand hoovers up the region’s supplies and lackluster European consumption weighs on Brent.“Given the bulk of the cuts stem from medium and heavy Middle Eastern producers, we would not be surprised to see Dubai trade at a premium to Brent in the coming months, particularly as China looks to ramp imports,” RBC analysts including Mike Tran and Helima Croft wrote in a report.Story continuesMost Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekApple’s Complex, Secretive Gamble to Move Beyond ChinaThanks to Putin, Business Is Booming for Germany’s Defense ContractorsThe Undercover Organizers Behind America’s Union WinsA Giant Rail Merger Escapes Washington’s Big Deal CrackdownWhy Cheaper Insulin Today Risks Higher Costs Later©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Mester also suggested that rates will remain above the 5% mark for longer.But weak manufacturing activity data, coupled with signs of cooling in the U.S. jobs market, saw investors doubt just how much economic headroom the Fed will have to keep raising rates. Weak economic indicators also pushed up fears of a looming recession, driving safe haven flows into gold.Spot gold rose 0.2% to $2,024.81 an ounce, while gold futures rose 0.1% to $2,041.00 an ounce by 22:49 ET (02:49 GMT). Gold's spot price was now trading less than $50 from a record high of $2,072.90 an ounce, hit during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.Gold prices have been on a tear since early-May, as fears of a banking collapse spurred safe haven plays into bullion. While government intervention assuaged concerns of bigger banking ructions, fears of any remaining scars on the economy kept gold demand underpinned.The yellow metal also benefited from an increasing number of bets that the Fed will have limited economic headroom to keep raising interest rates.Data on Tuesday showed that orders for U.S.-manufactured goods fell more than expected in February, while job openings also fell. This came after a string of weak manufacturing activity indicators from across the globe on Monday.The dollar took little support from Mester’s comments, and was trading close to two-month lows against a basket of currencies on Wednesday.Weakness in the dollar underpinned most other precious metals, with platinum futures up 0.3%, while silver added 0.6%. Both metals were also sitting on strong gains this week.Story continuesOn the other hand, fears of slowing economic growth decimated copper prices, with the red metal tumbling sharply over the past two sessions.Copper futures were flat at a two-week low of $3.9707 a pound on Wednesday, after tumbling nearly 3% over the past two sessions.

Nears Deal for Harry Potter Online TV SeriesUBS Chairman’s Top-Secret Prep Paid Off in Credit Suisse MomentChina’s Yuan Replaces Dollar as Most Traded Currency in RussiaBernard Arnault’s Fortune Soars Past $200 Billion for First TimeChicago Elects Tax Proponent, Progressive Johnson as MayorSouth Australia’s last coal-fired power plant had closed, leaving the province of 1.8 million heavily reliant on wind farms and power imports from a neighboring region. When an unprecedented blackout caused much of the country to question the state’s dependence on clean power, Tesla boasted — on Twitter, of course — that it had a solution: It could build the world’s biggest battery, and fast.“@Elonmusk, how serious are you about this,” replied Australian software billionaire and climate activist Mike Cannon-Brookes. “Can you guarantee 100MW in 100 days?”Musk responded: “Tesla will get the system installed and working 100 days from contract signature or it is free. That serious enough for you?”To the astonishment of many, Tesla succeeded, and today, almost seven years later, that battery and more like it have become central to a shockingly rapid energy transition. By the middle of the next decade, major coal-fired power stations that generate about half of Australia’s electricity will shut down. Gas-fired plants are being retired, too, and nuclear power is banned. That leaves solar, wind and hydro as the major options in the country’s post-coal future.“It’s really a remarkable story,” said Audrey Zibelman, the former head of the Australian Energy Market Operator, or AEMO, the agency that runs the grid, and now an adviser to Alphabet Inc.’s X. “Because we’re not interconnected, we’ve had to learn to do it in a much more sophisticated way, where a lot of other countries will go once they’ve shut down their fossils.”Story continuesIt may be Australia’s biggest power buildout since electrification in the 1920s and 30s. And, if successful, could be replicated across the 80% of the world’s population that lives in the so-called sun belt — which includes Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, India, southern China and Southeast Asia, says Professor Andrew Blakers, an expert in renewable energy and solar technology at Australian National University. That, in turn, would go a long way to halting climate change.Building battery storage is just one critical piece of the national project, and AEMO and others are worried coal plants will shut before there’s enough additional electricity supply. Australia needs to increase its grid-scale wind and solar capacity ninefold by 2050. Connecting all that generation and storage into the grid will require more investment.Overall, the cost could be a staggering A$320 billion ($215 billion), and the money is starting to flow: Brookfield Asset Management Ltd., Macquarie Group Ltd., and billionaires Andrew Forrest and Cannon-Brookes have all been involved in headline-grabbing energy deals in recent months. New government support for renewables has also improved investor sentiment, according to the Clean Energy Investor Group, which includes project developers and financiers.Australia’s great coal switch-off is coming. New South Wales, the most populous state and home to Sydney, will lose one massive plant this month, followed by Eraring, the country’s largest, in 2025. Victoria, the second most populous state, saw a major site shuttered in 2017. Next up is Yallourn Power Station, which dates back more than a century and is scheduled to close in 2028.“I’m never going to say keep a coal plant open,” said Greg McIntyre, head of the Yallourn plant, a two-hour drive east of Melbourne. “But you’ve got to be realistic about what you’re switching off. Because with these plants, once you’ve switched them off, you can’t switch them on again.”Until recently Australia was a climate laggard. A brief carbon tax was scrapped in 2014, it had no electric vehicle policy, and a 2030 emissions reduction target of just 26% to 28% below 2005 levels. Through the early 2020s, politicians routinely downplayed the risk of climate change — former prime minister Tony Abbott famously dismissed climate science as “absolute crap.” His treasurer and an eventual successor, Scott Morrison, once brought a lump of coal into parliament to taunt his pro-climate adversaries.But while Canberra politicians ignored the energy transition, Australians were installing solar panels at record speed. China-made solar panels were cheap, and legacy government rebates sweetened the deal. From 2010 to 2020, the installed capacity of rooftop solar increased by 2,000%. Wind also grew rapidly. The market was awash in cheap electricity, and coal-fired suppliers soon found it harder to compete.A coal plant in South Australia was the first early closure, in 2016. The next year, another retired in Victoria. The energy transition was underway, whether the government liked it or not. Of 15 key coal plants that power Australia’s main national grid, one-third are officially scheduled to shut by 2030. In less than 20 years, all of the country’s coal plants could be closed, the agency says.With solar panels on the roofs of nearly one in three residential homes, Australia already has the highest penetration of rooftop solar per capita. By 2050, that proportion will grow to 65%, AEMO predicts, and account for more than a third of the country’s installed generation capacity.Deployments of wind and large-scale solar farms will also surge. In total, renewables will supply 98% of electricity on Australia’s main grid from mid-century, up from around 35% today, according to AEMO.The election last May of the center-left Labor Party has reassured the country’s financiers and investors about clean energy policy. Investment in renewables jumped 17% in 2022, mostly late in the year, after the new government announced emissions cuts and acted to enshrine them in law, according to the Clean Energy Council, an industry group.“We are the global pathfinder for demonstrating that the rapid transition is possible,” Blakers said. “And it’s turning out to be much easier than most people think.”Tesla’s grid-scale batteries are one part of the solution. They can absorb excess energy when it’s windy and sunny, then feed it back into the grid when it isn’t.The original Tesla battery, owned and operated by France-based renewables group Neoen SA, is now a cornerstone of South Australia’s grid. It also served as a prototype for a much bigger installation: The Victorian Big Battery, comprised of 212 white boxes in a field west of Melbourne, capable of dispatching as much power as a giant coal turbine on a split-second’s notice.Batteries can also solve a more technical problem. Coal generators do something wind and solar can’t: their giant spinning turbines provide inertia, which regulates the frequency of the entire grid. Without it, the network becomes highly unstable and the risk of blackouts soars.“When there’s no more coal or gas running, you need to have someone who is setting the pace for the network, and batteries are able to do that,” said Neoen Australia Managing Director Louis de Sambucy.But batteries can’t do everything. Specifically, they don’t generate power, and one of the biggest challenges is solving the winter problem known as the dunkelflaute, a period when weak sunlight and low wind combine with high power demand to drain power stores faster than they can be replenished.“Batteries are very good at short term dispatch — fractions of a second, or minutes, or hours. The idea they can be good for days is not realistic,” says Tony Wood, energy program director at the Australia-based Grattan Institute think tank. What is needed, he says, is “deep storage” which can last weeks. He says currently the only feasible answer is natural gas, a fossil fuel.Zibelman is more sanguine. She says zero-carbon technologies like pumped hydro, compressed air storage, and potentially green hydrogen plants can provide that deep, lasting storage without contributing to climate change. Blakers is even more bullish, arguing pumped hydro combined with batteries can provide all the storage Australia, and most of the world, needs.The Australian government has backed pumped hydro, building the Snowy 2.0 project near Canberra that will use electricity to pump water from a lower reservoir along 27 kilometers (16.8 miles) of underground tunnels to an upper reservoir when demand is low.When demand is high, it will release that water back down a parallel tunnel, passing through a turbine and generating electricity. This closed-loop system will be capable of storing enough energy to power 3 million homes for a week, according to the state-owned firm building the facility. There are also plans to tap the island of Tasmania for hydropower and feed the mainland via new undersea transmission lines.That’s insufficient to respond to a severe dunkelflaute, says Wood. Australia will need many more. Meanwhile, Snowy 2.0 is over budget and has suffered construction mishaps. All that highlights the complexity of building the infrastructure needed to fill the gap left when coal plants retire.Zibelman says demand management will also be key, for example, switching off unnecessary loads when supply is low. This will increasingly be done by artificial intelligence, she says.But Abbott’s and Morrison’s Liberal National coalition, now in opposition, isn’t convinced renewables and storage are enough. After years of backing coal and gas, it has started campaigning to overturn the national ban on nuclear power, a proposal that the Labor government has rejected.At the Yallourn plant outside of Melbourne, there’s no sign of the tectonic change ahead. Conveyor belts carrying mud-like brown coal arrive daily, with fuel dug out of a vast open-cut mine across the river. For nearly 100 years this is how Melburnians have got their power. It’s an anachronistic, carbon dioxide-spewing business, but it keeps the lights on in this city of 5 million people.A few kilometers away, though, Yallourn’s owner, CLP Holdings Ltd.’s EnergyAustralia is building its own big battery, around the same size as Neoen’s Victorian Big Battery. It’s scheduled to come online in 2026.After Yallourn, the state’s last two remaining coal plants a few kilometers away will also shut. In a few short years, Victoria will go from relying on coal for 70% of its electricity, to being entirely coal-free. Australia must get building, and fast.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThanks to Putin, Business Is Booming for Germany’s Defense ContractorsApple’s Complex, Secretive Gamble to Move Beyond ChinaThe Undercover Organizers Behind America’s Union WinsA Giant Rail Merger Escapes Washington’s Big Deal CrackdownWhy Cheaper Insulin Today Risks Higher Costs Later©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

On Monday, the probability of a 25-bp hike was more than 65%.The U.S. dollar index dropped to a two-month low of 101.45 and was last down 0.5% at 101.56. Sterling rose to a new 10-month high against the dollar, while the euro reached its highest level since February. The euro was last up 0.5% at $1.09550.""We believe the buck will slowly but surely continue to dwindle as the challenges of a recovering economy that wants to get away from dollar dominance will put downward pressure on its value,"" said Juan Perez, director of trading at Monex USA in Washington.The Australian dollar came under pressure after the Reserve Bank of Australia left interest rates unchanged after 10 straight increases. It was last down 0.5% against the U.S. dollar at $0.6754.Spot gold added 1.8% to $2,020.42 an ounce.(Reporting by Caroline Valetkevitch in New York Additional reporting by Amanda Cooper in London and Herbert Lash and Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss in New York Editing by Jonathan Oatis, Matthew Lewis and Deepa Babington)]"

What’s more interesting is that, General Dynamics’s share price is theoretically quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to move to its intrinsic value, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value.

Despite the quiet and range-bound trading in the major indices, the weekend was news-filled, and specific sectors saw significant gains.Merger MondayThe weekend was chock full of merger and acquisition news, but one deal stood above them all. Over the weekend, UFC owner Endeavor (EDR) announced it would merge with World Wide Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). The deal is valued at $21 billion and will make the newly combined company the most dominant in the space.WYNNing Macau Numbers Shares of gaming giant Wynn Resorts (WYNN) popped to fresh 52-week highs in early trading after the company announced strong numbers from its Macau division. Gaming revenue from the region soared by nearly 250% year-over-year. The revenue was the strongest since before the COVID-19 pandemic. Wynn was recently covered in our Bull of the Day column on March 28th. Industry group peer Las Vegas Sands (LVS) rose in sympathy.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOPEC Cuts Send Oil SoaringOPEC, or the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, is a group of 13 countries that control a significant portion of the world’s oil supply. OPEC countries account for nearly 40% of the world’s oil production. Sunday, OPEC announced a surprise production cut of more than one million barrels a day. After the announcement, crude oil futures shot higher by more than 6%. The gains carried into trading Monday were the strongest in 2023 and the largest in nearly one year.As was evident on Monday, changes in OPEC’s oil production decisions can dramatically impact the overall oil market. The energy sector is the big early week winner and gained 4.50%. Another winner is Warren Buffett. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has been steadily accumulating shares of Occidental Petroleum (OXY) and now owns more than 200 million shares or roughly $12 billion worth of the stock. Looking at OXY’s fundamental picture clarifies why Buffett is such a big buyer. Occidental’s price-to-earnings ratio of 6.69x EPS makes the stock very attractive from a value perspective when compared to the S&amp;P 500’s P/E of 19.0x.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBeyond OXY, oil stocks rose across the board, including Exxon Mobil (XOM), BP (BP), Halliburton (HAL), and countless others.Tesla’s Electric Delivery NumbersShares of the world’s leading electric vehicle maker fell on Monday by 6% after announcing record delivery numbers of 422,000 vehicles. Though the numbers were stellar, the actual announcement was a “sell the news” type event and was likely already priced into the stock. For now, Tesla (TSLA) continues to find support at its rising 50-day moving average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

195,18831b93-1ffc-3256-8b6d-4c9821f07bd8,ZTS,2023-04-05,3 Healthcare Stocks to Watch As the Industry Evolves,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-healthcare-stocks-watch-industry-143720883.html,1680273440,STORY,"['ZTS', 'CVS', 'ABT']","[In 2022, healthcare stocks surpassed the S&amp;P 500. But in 2023, they are not doing so well. Nonetheless, during economic uncertainty, the healthcare industry can serve as a reliable defensive strategy since individuals typically do not cut back on prescription drug acquisitions, postpone medical procedures, or cancel appointments with doctors solely due to a sluggish economy.In 2021, health spending in the U.S. rose by 2.7% to $4.3 trillion, or $12,914 per capita, significantly lower than the growth rate of 10.3% in 2020. Nonetheless, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services predict that healthcare spending in the U.S. will have an average annual growth rate of 5.1% between 2021 and 2030. That will result in a total expenditure of $6.8 trillion. This projection offers excellent long-term investment opportunities in the sector.Healthcare stocks are great if you are an investor looking for safer waters. Across the board, they are defensive investments that will do well in multiple scenarios. As a result, if you are among those that want more bang for their buck, healthcare stocks are enticing.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHere are three stocks we have curated for you to study if you want to invest in healthcare.Zoetis (ZTS)a magnifying glass enlarges the Zoetis logo on a websiteSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comZoetis (NYSE:ZTS) is a prominent player in the global animal health industry, focusing on developing vaccines, medicines, and diagnostics for veterinarians and livestock producers.The company’s companion animal business is expected to drive long-term growth, particularly in the pet parasiticides market, which presents the biggest opportunity in animal health. Zoetis is also making significant strides in companion animal pain management, further solidifying its position in the industry.With a diverse range of products, including medicine, vaccines, genetic tests, and other offerings, Zoetis generates approximately $8 billion in revenue annually. The majority of this revenue, over 60%, is generated from the companion animal segment. The division includes products for dogs, cats, and horses. The remainder of the revenue comes from Zoetis’ livestock segment. The company offers around 300 products. Out of the total, 15 key offerings generate at least $100 million in annual revenue.Story continuesThe stock will do well due to the growth in pet ownership in the U.S. Pet industry expenditure exceeded $126 billion in 2021. The increase in pet ownership contributed to this growth. In 2020, 70% of American households owned one or more pets, up from 56% in 1988.Considering these secular tailwinds, Zoetis is among the best healthcare stocks to buy.CVS Health Corp (CVS)earnings reports cvsSource: ShutterstockAs the largest pharmacy healthcare provider in the United States, CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) has a strong balance sheet, impressive free cash flow, and an attractive valuation, according to some analysts. Furthermore, CVS’s shift from being a drug store retailer to a holistic healthcare provider offering insurance, prescription drug management, and primary care services differentiates it from its competitors.With America’s largest pharmacy benefits management business under its belt, CVS Health has leveraged its extensive retail presence to support additional operations. One such operation is its health insurance benefits management, bolstered by the acquisition of Aetna for approximately $78 billion in 2018, making CVS Health one of the largest health insurance benefits management providers in the United States.As America’s population ages, the demand for healthcare services will increase steadily. Many of these services are provided directly by CVS Health. The company already operates over 1,100 walk-in medical clinics. Its proposed acquisition of Oak Street Health for $10.6 billion will add hundreds of primary care providers working in 169 medical centers, further expanding CVS Health’s capacity to provide essential healthcare services.In summary, CVS Health is set to achieve consistent and robust profit growth. This is because it can provide and oversee numerous health benefits directly. As a result, it presents an appealing prospect to investors for an extended period.Abbott Laboratories (ABT)Close up of Abbott Laboratories sign at their headquarters in Silicon ValleySource: Sundry Photography/Shutterstock.comAbbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is a top medical device sector player. It also operates in other industries, such as nutrition and a generic pharmaceutical division focusing on developing nations. The company’s triumphs can be attributed to its ability to create superior products and generate increased revenue and profits.As a diversified healthcare company, Abbott Laboratories holds a prestigious distinction as a member of the exclusive group known as the Dividend Aristocrats. These comprise stocks that have consistently raised dividends for at least 25 consecutive years.Abbott investors experienced a dividend increase for the 51st consecutive year last year.Abbott’s past achievements are fantastic. However, the future is more important. Its strength lies in its innovative culture, which is critical in the healthcare industry and continually demands breakthrough products. For instance, Abbott rapidly created and marketed several COVID-19 diagnostic tests, leading the market during the pandemic.Another example is the FreeStyle Libre franchise, a continuous glucose monitoring system that enables diabetes patients to monitor their blood glucose levels in real time. In 2022, revenue reached $4.3 billion, increasing by around 16% from the year-ago period. Abbott projects the product line will generate revenue of $10 billion by 2028.Abbott Laboratories’ dedication to innovation and growth is apparent. Its plans include introducing products in various areas, such as structural heart, heart failure units, and beyond. It will only bolster the bottom line and improve its standing among investors and consumers. This commitment underscores why it is one of the top healthcare stocks around.On the publication date, Faizan Farooque did not hold (directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

NextEra Energy Partners provided total cash consideration of approximately $200 million for the equity interest, which exceeds the minimum buyout that was necessary to have occurred prior to June 2023.(PRNewsfoto/NextEra Energy Partners, LP)Transaction detailsIn December 2019, NextEra Energy Partners entered into a convertible equity portfolio financing with EIG Net Holdings III, LLC. In that financing, EIG paid $750 million in cash in exchange for a non-controlling equity interest in a NextEra Energy Partners subsidiary that owned a portfolio of seven natural gas pipeline assets, one of which was sold in April 2022. The agreement that was entered into at the time of the financing provides NextEra Energy Partners with the right to repurchase EIG's equity interest subject to certain terms and that would result in a pre-tax return to EIG of 7.8% (inclusive of all prior distributions).NextEra Energy Partners completed as of March 31, 2023, its first exercise of its buyout right under the agreement for aggregate cash consideration of approximately $200 million. To pay its purchase price, NextEra Energy Partners used proceeds of approximately $150 million from its sale of 2.3 million common units under its at-the-market equity issuance program with the balance being funded through a planned draw on the subsidiary's revolving credit facility. The sale of the 2.3 million common units represents less than 3% of NextEra Energy Partners' public float, and less than 5% of the average daily trading volume based on the number of available trading days in the quarter. In addition, it represents approximately three days of trading volume for NextEra Energy Partners units.Story continuesOutlook and financing flexibilityFrom a base of its fourth-quarter 2022 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $3.25, NextEra Energy Partners continues to see 12% to 15% growth per year in limited partner distributions per unit as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2026. NextEra Energy Partners expects the annualized rate of the fourth-quarter 2023 distribution that is payable in February 2024 to be in a range of $3.64 to $3.74 per common unit.NextEra Energy Partners' run-rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution (CAFD) at Dec. 31, 2023, remain unchanged. Year-end 2023 run-rate adjusted EBITDA expectations are $2.22 billion to $2.42 billion and CAFD of $770 million to $860 million, respectively, reflecting calendar-year 2024 contributions expected from the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2023.NextEra Energy Partners had approximately $3 billion available liquidity as of Dec. 31, 2022. NextEra Energy Partners expects to continue to have significant financing capacity and ample liquidity for growth. Additionally, NextEra Energy Partners continues to have $6 billion of forward-starting interest rate swaps, providing significant interest-rate protection on near-term maturities as well as supporting future growth.Additionally, separate from the at-the-market equity issuance program transaction described above, in March 2023, NextEra Energy Partners initiated the sale of common units under a portion of its recently established $500 million at-the-market equity issuance program, which is expected to result in proceeds of approximately $135 million.The expectations discussed herein are subject to the usual caveats and include the impact of incentive distribution rights (IDR) fees, as these fees are treated as an operating expense.This news release refers to adjusted EBITDA and CAFD expectations. NextEra Energy Partners' adjusted EBITDA expectations represent projected (a) revenue less (b) fuel expense, less (c) project operating expenses, less (d) corporate G&amp;A, plus (e) other income less (f) other deductions including IDR fees. Projected revenue as used in the calculations of projected EBITDA represents the sum of projected (a) operating revenues plus (b) a pre-tax allocation of production tax credits, plus (c) a pre-tax allocation of investment tax credits plus (d) earnings impact from convertible investment tax credits and plus (e) the reimbursement for lost revenue received pursuant to a contract with NextEra Energy Resources.CAFD is defined as cash available for distribution and represents adjusted EBITDA less (1) a pre-tax allocation of production tax credits, less (2) a pre-tax allocation of investment tax credits, less (3) earnings impact from convertible investment tax credits, less (4) debt service, less (5) maintenance capital, less (6) income tax payments less, (7) other non-cash items included in adjusted EBITDA if any. CAFD excludes changes in working capital and distributions to preferred equity investors.Adjusted EBITDA, CAFD and limited partner distributions and other expectations assume, among other things, normal weather and operating conditions; positive macroeconomic conditions in the U.S.; public policy support for wind and solar development and construction; market demand and transmission expansion support for wind and solar development; market demand for pipeline capacity; access to capital at reasonable cost and terms; and no changes to governmental policies or incentives. Please see the accompanying cautionary statements for a list of the risk factors that may affect future results. Adjusted EBITDA and CAFD do not represent substitutes for net income, as prepared in accordance with GAAP. The adjusted EBITDA and CAFD run-rate expectations have not been reconciled to expected net income because NextEra Energy Partners' net income includes unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses related to derivative transactions, which cannot be determined at this time.NextEra Energy Partners, LP NextEra Energy Partners, LP (NYSE: NEP) is a growth-oriented limited partnership formed by NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NEE). NextEra Energy Partners acquires, manages and owns contracted clean energy projects with stable, long-term cash flows.

The future results of NEP and its business and financial condition are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause NEP's actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties could require NEP to limit or eliminate certain operations. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: NEP's ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders is affected by the performance of its renewable energy projects which could be impacted by wind and solar conditions and in certain circumstances by market prices; operation and maintenance of renewable energy projects and pipelines involve significant risks that could result in unplanned power outages, reduced output or capacity, personal injury or loss of life; NEP's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects can be materially adversely affected by weather conditions, including, but not limited to, the impact of severe weather; NEP depends on certain of the renewable energy projects and pipelines in its portfolio for a substantial portion of its anticipated cash flows; NEP may pursue the repowering of renewable energy projects or the expansion of natural gas pipelines that would require up-front capital expenditures and could expose NEP to project development risks; geopolitical factors, terrorist acts, cyberattacks or other similar events could impact NEP's projects, pipelines or surrounding areas and adversely affect its business; The ability of NEP to obtain insurance and the terms of any available insurance coverage could be materially adversely affected by international, national, state or local events and company-specific events, as well as the financial condition of insurers. NEP's insurance coverage does not provide protection against all significant losses; NEP relies on interconnection, transmission and other pipeline facilities of third parties to deliver energy from its renewable energy projects and to transport natural gas to and from its pipelines.

""Despite a weak construction outlook, 36% of survey respondents have a larger backlog now than they did at this time in 2019, and 20% have a 10+% larger backlog.""The survey consisted of 45 professional paint contractors from across the U.S. who spend more than $5,000 annually on paint. About 7% of the survey respondents spend more than $100,000 annually.""This [report] seems to match some of our recent calls with paint contractors who highlighted high 2023 bidding activity and lofty backlogs, particularly in commercial end markets,"" Byrne added. ""The largest contractors ($100+k/yr in paint spend) had the greatest backlogs. This should provide a more favorable volume outlook in the first half for paint suppliers, but with potential contraction in the second half.""The economic vibe from paint demand is one of strength, thinks Bank of America.The findings have direct implications for ""paint stocks,"" Byrne noted:Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW): ""The resilience of pro backlogs bodes favorably for Buy-rated Home Depot and Lowe's, for whom sales to pros comprise about 50% and 30% of their respective totals.""Sherwin-Williams (SHW): ""These data are clearly favorable for the near-term earnings outlook for Sherwin, but we remain Neutral due to a more cautious second half outlook for U.S. residential and commercial construction.""PPG (PPG), Masco (MAS), and Axalta (AXTA): ""We remain Buy-rated on PPG and Axalta due to the auto and refinish exposures. We maintain our Underperform rating on Masco to reflect our view that do-it-yourself (65% of Behr brand sales) paint demand remains under pressure against difficult comparisons.""Craftswoman, painter, and interior designer works at a client's place on March 5, 2015. (Photo by: Andia/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)BofA's paint research is on the surprising side of things given the array of knocks the economy has taken only three months into the year.Story continuesMarch brought fresh banking turmoil that has weighed on consumer confidence. The month also brought another interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve, making it even more expensive to buy a new home or refresh an existing one with a couple of coats of paint.All told, the GDPNow model estimate for real first-quarter GDP stands at 1.7%, down from 2.5% growth on March 31.Byrne cautioned that paint contractors may be too hopeful about demand headed into the spring. But by and large, the demand signals offer a message of economic resilience headed into the spring shopping season.""Our respondents may have slightly overestimated the 2023 paint demand growth as the 2023 paint volume growth expectation (vs COVID) is lower than it was in our October survey,"" Byrne said.

Although still high by historical standards, that represented welcome news for the BoE which is worried about the persistence of the recent surge in inflation.(Reporting by William Schomberg; Editing by Hugh Lawson)]"

Mester also suggested that rates will remain above the 5% mark for longer.But weak manufacturing activity data, coupled with signs of cooling in the U.S. jobs market, saw investors doubt just how much economic headroom the Fed will have to keep raising rates. Weak economic indicators also pushed up fears of a looming recession, driving safe haven flows into gold.Spot gold rose 0.2% to $2,024.81 an ounce, while gold futures rose 0.1% to $2,041.00 an ounce by 22:49 ET (02:49 GMT). Gold's spot price was now trading less than $50 from a record high of $2,072.90 an ounce, hit during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.Gold prices have been on a tear since early-May, as fears of a banking collapse spurred safe haven plays into bullion. While government intervention assuaged concerns of bigger banking ructions, fears of any remaining scars on the economy kept gold demand underpinned.The yellow metal also benefited from an increasing number of bets that the Fed will have limited economic headroom to keep raising interest rates.Data on Tuesday showed that orders for U.S.-manufactured goods fell more than expected in February, while job openings also fell. This came after a string of weak manufacturing activity indicators from across the globe on Monday.The dollar took little support from Mester’s comments, and was trading close to two-month lows against a basket of currencies on Wednesday.Weakness in the dollar underpinned most other precious metals, with platinum futures up 0.3%, while silver added 0.6%. Both metals were also sitting on strong gains this week.Story continuesOn the other hand, fears of slowing economic growth decimated copper prices, with the red metal tumbling sharply over the past two sessions.Copper futures were flat at a two-week low of $3.9707 a pound on Wednesday, after tumbling nearly 3% over the past two sessions.

Materials also finished lower.The yield on two-year Treasuries, which typically move in step with interest rate expectations, fell 14 basis points to 3.840%, while the benchmark 10-year note's yield slid 9 basis points to 3.342%.Crude oil prices were near flat after Monday's sharp rally tied to Sunday's announcement of an output target cut by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its partners.Brent crude rose 1 cent to settle at $84.94 a barrel, while U.S. crude gained 29 cents to settle at $80.71.The recent spike in oil prices has added to concerns about higher costs for businesses and consumers, but some investors think U.S. data signaling some cooling in the economy could possibly allow the Federal Reserve to loosen monetary policy.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 198.77 points, or 0.59%, to 33,402.38, the S&amp;P 500 lost 23.91 points, or 0.58%, to 4,100.6 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 63.13 points, or 0.52%, to 12,126.33.The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.08% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.24%.The Fed and other central banks have been raising interest rates to bring down inflation, and investors have been trying to gauge how much longer the tightening cycle will continue.Story continues""Cooling down of the labor market is one of the things necessary to combat inflation,"" said Andrzej Skiba, head of the BlueBay U.S. fixed income team at RBC Global Asset Management in New York.On Tuesday, rate futures markets were pricing in a roughly even chance of a 25 basis-point rate hike in May, with rest of the odds tilted toward a pause from the Fed. On Monday, the probability of a 25-bp hike was more than 65%.The U.S. dollar index dropped to a two-month low of 101.45 and was last down 0.5% at 101.56. Sterling rose to a new 10-month high against the dollar, while the euro reached its highest level since February. The euro was last up 0.5% at $1.09550.""We believe the buck will slowly but surely continue to dwindle as the challenges of a recovering economy that wants to get away from dollar dominance will put downward pressure on its value,"" said Juan Perez, director of trading at Monex USA in Washington.The Australian dollar came under pressure after the Reserve Bank of Australia left interest rates unchanged after 10 straight increases.

Trip.com, based in Singapore, released a chatbot earlier this year.Expedia users can now use the tool — a separate chatbot from the virtual agent that the app has already had — to help during travel planning by asking general questions about a destination or trip ideas. (See a demo.)The tool automatically saves hotels that the chatbot recommends. The user can then go to the “Trips” tab within the app and click on the saved items to check availability for booking. The tool does not yet offer specific real-time information about details like pricing and events.This tool is in addition to the Expedia plugin for ChatGPT that OpenAI announced last month. The plugin is accessible to some users through the ChatGPT website, while the new chatbot is available on the Expedia mobile app homepage.This app tool is in the beta testing phase, and Expedia said it is gathering data as users experiment.While the new capability doesn’t exactly deliver the next-generation planning and booking experience that experts envision — a place where users can fully plan and book all parts of a trip on one platform — the tool does bring that vision a step closer.The latest version of Bing, powered by ChatGPT, is probably the closest thing resembling that vision that’s been released to the public so far. The Bing platform includes a fuller picture of suggestions and links to accompany its results, although the links are often not helpful and there’s no booking capability.The new Expedia tool offers fewer links, but they go directly to a booking page. However, the user does have to input all details from there.This is the first major online travel agency in the West that has released this type of tool. Trip.com, the Singpore-based online travel agency whose parent is based in China, released a chatbot earlier this year.Story continuesSo far, Trip.com’s TripGen does not offer any links at all. And unlike TripGen, the Expedia tool will only answer travel-related questions.For an industry with so much legacy technology, it’s difficult to adopt and push new innovations. It’ll be the big companies like Expedia that are able to do anything of significance first, as Rathi Murthy, chief technology officer for Expedia Group, highlighted during a call in March.“Honestly, the travel industry as a whole has a lot of legacy technology, and it’s not super easy to move in and adopt some of this. But I do see players like us — players that have core technology in the background, large OTAs — start jumping in to experiment and try things out,” Murthy said in March.Booking.com has yet to release anything powered by OpenAI the company behind ChatGPT, or Google’s Bard, a rival. However, sister companies Kayak and OpenTable were among the handful of companies, along with Expedia, that have partnered recently on plugins for ChatGPT.Booking.com Chief Technology Officer Rob Francis has said, it likely will not be soon — but he believes travel planning is sure to change. He sees a big opportunity in “adaptive content,” in which the tech could generate a unique page based on the deeper intent of a user when making a search query.Rafat adds his analysis: “So Expedia is the first one out of the gate to launch a travel planning chatbot in its app, and it is…ok. Marks for iterating with speed, first with the plugin inside ChatGPT couple of weeks ago, and now with the reverse, integrating that same tech into its own app.BUT, but, the results are very generic, at least the travel planning part, and even as I write this travel planning through ChatGPT is already commoditized, UNLESS, and this is a big IF these large companies like Expedia, Booking, Airbnb, Trip and others have to solve soon, they can train the LLMs on a unique and proprietary corpus of content that neither ChatGPT/Google Bard or any of the other travel players have. Which as far as I know at least on the trip planning/content side, none of them have. Give me two developers and I can build this on top of GPT-4 in a week.So then the big battle — beyond the race to be first — becomes:1) who innovates on the UX/UI side that is so unique that people are drawn to using it at top of the funnel and then lead to higher conversion to booking? 2) can any of these players find the proprietary content they can train these LLMs on? 3) what unique personalization they can come up with through AI to match the query to the actual air/hotel/cruise etc results the prospective traveler is looking for? This is the hardest but the best part to solve. 4) Will any of the big travel players create their own LLMs? That requires a lot of work but could be worth it, I would think Airbnb type companies could build in a travel-focused LLM, though to what end vs OpenAI/Cohere/Google/HuggingFace etc.”Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

It's also important to remember that while many measures have been taken to limit inaccurate results and inappropriate responses, at times the experience may not work exactly as expected. Feedback from both our employees and all those using the experience will be continually looked at to make sure responses meet our standards.The conversational trip planning beta experience is rolling out globally in the English language on the Expedia iOS app.About Expedia Expedia® is one of the world's leading full-service travel brands, with a mission of helping travelers get the most out of every trip they take by providing everything they need all in one place, ensuring they are getting the most out of every trip they take, and above all else, feel supported every step of the way.

These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin, cephalosporin, or carbapenem hypersensitivity or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. If an allergic reaction occurs, Zosyn should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions: Zosyn may cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis. If patients develop a skin rash they should be monitored closely and Zosyn discontinued if lesions progress.Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH): Cases of HLH have been reported in pediatric and adult patients treated with Zosyn. Signs and symptoms of HLH may include fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly and cytopenia. If HLH is suspected, discontinue Zosyn immediately and institute appropriate management.Hematologic Adverse Reactions: Bleeding manifestations have occurred in some patients receiving beta-lactam drugs, including piperacillin. These reactions have sometimes been associated with abnormalities of coagulation tests such as clotting time, platelet aggregation and prothrombin time, and are more likely to occur in patients with renal failure. If bleeding manifestations occur, Zosyn should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. The leukopenia/neutropenia associated with Zosyn administration appears to be reversible and most frequently associated with prolonged administration.Periodic assessment of hematopoietic function should be performed, especially with prolonged therapy, i.e., ≥ 21 days.Central Nervous System Adverse Reactions: As with other penicillins, Zosyn may cause neuromuscular excitability or seizures. Patients receiving higher doses, especially patients with renal impairment may be at greater risk for central nervous system adverse reactions. Closely monitor patients with renal impairment or seizure disorders for signs and symptoms of neuromuscular excitability or seizures.Nephrotoxicity in Critically Ill Patients: The use of Zosyn was found to be an independent risk factor for renal failure and was associated with delayed recovery of renal function as compared to other beta-lactam antibacterial drugs in critically ill patients. Alternative treatment options should be considered in the critically ill population. If alternative treatment options are inadequate or unavailable, monitor renal function during treatment with Zosyn.Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD): CDAD has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Zosyn, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.Adverse Reactions: The most common adverse reactions (incidence &gt;5%) are diarrhea, constipation, nausea, headache, and insomnia.Renal Impairment: In patients with creatinine clearance ≤ 40 mL/min and dialysis patients (hemodialysis and CAPD), the intravenous dose of Zosyn should be reduced to the degree of renal function impairment.Drug Interactions:Zosyn administration can significantly reduce tobramycin concentrations in hemodialysis patients. Monitor tobramycin concentrations in these patients.Probenecid prolongs the half-lives of piperacillin and tazobactam and should not be co-administered with Zosyn unless the benefit outweighs the risk.Co-administration of Zosyn with vancomycin may increase the incidence of acute kidney injury. Monitor kidney function in patients receiving Zosyn and vancomycin.Monitor coagulation parameters in patients receiving Zosyn and heparin or oral anticoagulants.Zosyn may prolong the neuromuscular blockade of vecuronium and other non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockers. Monitor for adverse reactions related to neuromuscular blockade.Please click here for accompanying full Prescribing Information for Zosyn.This release includes forward-looking statements concerning the launch of Zosyn premix and Baxter’s proprietary Galaxy container technology, including potential benefits associated with the use of Zosyn and Galaxy containers. The statements are based on assumptions about many important factors, including the following, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements: demand for and market acceptance for new and existing products; product development risks; inability to create additional production capacity in a timely manner or the occurrence of other manufacturing or supply difficulties (including as a result of natural disasters, public health crises and epidemics/pandemics, regulatory actions or otherwise); satisfaction of regulatory and other requirements; actions of regulatory bodies and other governmental authorities; product quality, manufacturing or supply, or patient safety issues; changes in law and regulations; and other risks identified in Baxter's most recent filing on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and other SEC filings, all of which are available on Baxter's website.

(NYSE:BAX), a leader in solutions to advance surgical innovation, unveiled multiple new additions to its surgical portfolios at the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses (AORN) Global Surgical Conference &amp; Expo 2023, taking place April 1 through April 4, 2023. These innovations include the launch of the new Baxter Patient Warming system, the unveiling of the Helux Pro Connected Surgical Light, and the launch of Floseal + Recothrom flowable hemostat, all of which are on display in Baxter’s AORN booth #2027.""Baxter takes a holistic approach to help surgical care teams navigate dynamic operating environments, providing a full suite of OR solutions that support critical decisions for patient care,"" said Andrew Frye, president, Patient Support Systems/Global Surgical Solutions and Enterprise Connectivity. ""We’re eager to demonstrate how our diverse portfolio of products and services can support delivering great outcomes for patients and maximizing operating room workflow efficiency.""Products featured at AORN 2023 include the commercial launch of a new conductive Baxter Patient Warming system designed to help achieve and maintain patient normothermia (body temperature within standard limits). The system eliminates the need for disposables, as the warming technology is built into the table pad, which can reach temperatures up to 40 degrees Celsius. In addition, reusable conductive warming blankets can reach temperatures of 43 degrees Celsius and provide an increased surface warming area to help quickly warm from above and below. The system is also air-free, which may reduce risks associated with forced air systems1—such as contamination of the surgical site—and operates quietly. This warming solution can also be combined with WaffleGrip, a positioning accessory that helps keep the patient warm and secure in the steep Trendelenburg position, in which a patient is tilted head-down at up to a 45-degree angle. The Baxter Patient Warming system is compatible with its TS7000, TS7000dV and PST 500 surgical tables.Story continuesBaxter also revealed a first look at its Helux Pro Connected Surgical Light, a wired lighting and camera solution for the operating room. Helux Pro features deep cavity lighting, auto pattern assist technology, and a feature which helps eliminate unwanted shadows to provide consistent illumination during a surgical procedure. An included 4K camera offers ultra-high definition, reliable image capture. In addition, Helux Pro includes innovative safety features like sterile light controls and a soft exterior bumper to mitigate accidental damage. Helux Pro is expected to launch later this quarter.Baxter’s Floseal + Recothrom is the first and only active flowable hemostat to use recombinant DNA technology. Floseal represents more than 20 years of leadership in hemostasis and has been proven to perform quickly and consistently across a range of bleeds in surgical procedures.2 Floseal + Recothrom has a thrombin component manufactured using recombinant DNA technology, and therefore contains no human blood components and eliminates reliance on human blood donations. Together in a single product, Floseal + Recothrom has the same simple preparation3 as Floseal + Human Thrombin but is more than 1.5 times faster4 to prepare, which may help improve operating room efficiency. Floseal + Recothrom 5mL is currently available in the U.S. and Floseal + Recothrom 10mL will be coming later this year.""When it comes to active hemostats in the operating room, effectiveness and speed are of critical importance given increasing patient complexity,"" said Steve Wallace, president, Advanced Surgery. ""The development and introduction of Floseal + Recothrom is the result of input from operating room nursing teams who prioritize fast time-to-table and ease of preparation – all areas where Floseal + Recothrom brings unique value.""Baxter’s broad portfolio of hemostatic and sealing agents effectively work to stop bleeding in a variety of anatomies to help lower bleeding-related complications and reduce overall costs.

Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, may occur. RECOTHROM thrombin is produced in a genetically modified Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line and may contain hamster or snake proteins.Antibody formation to RECOTHROM occurred in &lt;1% of patients. None of the antibodies detected neutralized native human thrombin.Thrombin must be added to the Gelatin Matrix prior to use.Do not use FLOSEAL Matrix in the closure of skin incisions because it may interfere with the healing of the skin edges.FLOSEAL Matrix is not intended as a substitute for meticulous surgical technique and the proper application of ligatures or other conventional procedures for hemostasis.Excess FLOSEAL Matrix (material not incorporated in the hemostatic clot) should always be removed by gentle irrigation from the site of application.The particles of FLOSEAL Matrix swell approximately 10-20% upon contact with blood or other fluids creating a tamponade effect. Maximum swell volume is achieved within about 10 minutes.The safety and effectiveness of FLOSEAL Matrix has not been established in children under 2 years of age and pregnant women.Do not use air to remove residual FLOSEAL Matrix from Applicator tip. The Applicator tips should not be cut. Do not use FLOSEAL Matrix on bone surfaces where adhesives, such as methylmethacrylate or other acrylic adhesives, will be required to attach a prosthetic device.As with other hemostatic agents, do not apply FLOSEAL Matrix to sites where there is negative peripheral venous pressure (e.g. due to patient positioning), as material may be drawn into the vascular system potentially resulting in life-threatening thromboembolic events.Rx Only.

Juries ruled against the company in nearly a dozen such suits over the years — including one appealed all the way to the US Supreme Court — before J&amp;J was forced to pay $2.5 billion to a group of 20 women whose case went to trial in 2018.Story continuesTraces of AsbestosWomen and men blamed J&amp;J’s 129-year-old baby powder for causing ovarian cancer and mesothelioma, a cancer specifically tied to asbestos exposure. Victims allege internal J&amp;J documents dating back to the early 1970s show workers warning managers about traces of asbestos found in talc bottled for baby powder. The victims contend J&amp;J executives should have warned consumers about the powders’ health risks.“This is the largest products liability settlement ever realized after a bankruptcy filing,” said Mikal Watts, one of the plaintiff lawyers who negotiated the deal with J&amp;J. “Our job is to get our clients restitution for their injuries, and this settlement is the culmination of over a decade of fighting for justice.”J&amp;J argues the talc cases pose a financial threat to the company despite its more than $478 billion market capitalization. That’s because juries could repeatedly hit J&amp;J with multi-billion verdicts that threaten its financial health, its lawyers contend. The company also has suffered reputational harm tied to the talc findings.J&amp;J has been criticized for using the bankruptcy courts to foster a settlement. Such filings allow firms to put suits on hold while a judge evaluates their value. Getting court approval for such trusts requires 75% of victims to vote in favor of having their claims through that process.Under the terms of the deal, J&amp;J agreed to pay $6.5 billion to resolve current and future ovarian cases, provide $2 billion for current and future mesothelioma cases and hand over $400 million to states who’ve sued J&amp;J for failing to warn consumers about the health risks tied to its talc-based powders or threatened to sue, according to people familiar with the deal who asked not to be identified because the details aren’t public.Opposing DealJ&amp;J negotiated its new deal with lawyers outside the leadership group overseeing talc cases consolidated as a multi-district litigation (MDL) before a federal judge in New Jersey. Attorneys in the MDL said J&amp;J isn’t putting up enough money and ridiculed its repeated attempts to use the bankruptcy process to deny victims trials.“This second bad-faith bankruptcy is an attempt by J&amp;J to bully cancer victims into accepting a low-ball deal that would leave most of them with staggering unpaid medical bills and lost wages,” Jason Itkin, a lawyer for claimants who oppose the deal, said in an email. “We believe this second bankruptcy will be dismissed just like the first one.”In its January ruling, the appeals court said J&amp;J wrongly put its newly created unit, LTL Management, under court protection to deal with the talc litigation. The three-judge panel found since J&amp;J agreed to set up a more than $61 billion backstop plan for its unit, the company wasn’t in “financial distress” and didn’t qualify for protection.Hours before the new case was filed, an official committee of talc claimants filed court papers arguing that a second Chapter 11 petition would be wrong. The group, which represented cancer victims in the first bankruptcy case, said the company should not be permitted to return to bankruptcy.The new filing should satisfy demands by the appeals court that rejected the first case, lawyers who crafted both Chapter 11 filings for J&amp;J argued in court papers. In the latest case, the firm replaced the backstop agreement with the $8.9 billion settlement, J&amp;J’s lawyers said. The settlement funds will be LTL’s only financial resource, they said.“I applaud Johnson &amp; Johnson on finding a fair and equitable solution which closes a painful chapter for a lot of American women,” said Mark Lanier, a Texas-based lawyer who won a $4.7 billion verdict against the company in 2018 on behalf of 20 women who blamed their ovarian cancer on baby powder use.The new bankruptcy filing is LTL Management LLC, 23-12825, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey (Trenton).(Updates with shares in pre-market trade in fifth paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekApple’s Complex, Secretive Gamble to Move Beyond ChinaThanks to Putin, Business Is Booming for Germany’s Defense ContractorsThe Undercover Organizers Behind America’s Union WinsA Giant Rail Merger Escapes Washington’s Big Deal CrackdownWhy Cheaper Insulin Today Risks Higher Costs Later©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

J&amp;J spun off LTL in 2021 to hold and manage the legal claims related to the controversial talc. That year, J&amp;J put a $2 billion tag on settling the suits but, earlier this year, an appeals court tossed LTL’s initial bankruptcy appeal citing that the company was not in financial distress.Read moreChatGPT is getting more nuancedChina is changing its tune on the mRNA vaccineA fresh idea for gathering remote and hybrid employees togetherThe refiling is a move “to obtain approval of a reorganization plan that will efficiently resolve all current and future claims arising from cosmetic talc litigation against the Company and its affiliates in North America,” the company said in a regulatory filing yesterday (Apr. 4).Attorney Mikal Watts of Watts Guerra, a law firm that has been in negotiations with J&amp;J since January, said the new settlement would be the “largest products liability settlement ever realized after a bankruptcy filing.”Johnson &amp; Johnson’s cancer lawsuits settlement proposal, by the digits25 years: The time frame over which the company will disburse the $8.9 billion in payments to alleged victims to “resolve all the current and future talc claims.”60,000: Current claimants LTL has secured commitments from “to support a global resolution on these terms.”3%: How much J&amp;J shares rose after US market close on April 410,000: Number of cases involving women claiming that talc-based powders made by Johnson &amp; Johnson caused their ovarian cancer handled by a law firm run by Jason Itkin$4.5 billion: How much J&amp;J has spent in jury awards, settlements, and legal costs fighting the cancer claims since 2017.75%: Share of claimants who have to approve the proposed settlement, alongside the Bankruptcy Court.Story continuesQuotable: Is J&amp;J’s talc lawsuits settlement fair?Erik Haas, worldwide vice president of litigation at Johnson &amp; Johnson, in an Apr. 4 statement:“The company continues to believe that these claims are specious and lack scientific merit. However, as the bankruptcy court recognized, resolving these cases in the tort system would take decades and impose significant costs on LTL and the system, with most claimants never receiving any compensation. Resolving this matter through the proposed reorganization plan is both more equitable and more efficient, allows claimants to be compensated in a timely manner, and enables the company to remain focused on our commitment to profoundly and positively impact health for humanity.”Jason Itkin, who represents the claimants, told the New York Times the J&amp;J deal was “bad for victims”:“Even though $8.9 billion sounds like a lot of money, when you spread it out it comes out to not very much at all for the people who suffered.”A brief timeline of J&amp;J trying to settle lawsuits via LTL’s Chapter 11 bankruptcyOctober 2021: Old Consumer uses the so-called “Texas Two-Step”—a corporate restructuring maneuver under Texas law which allows businesses to divide themselves into separate companies, shift mass tort liabilities to one of them, and have that company declare bankruptcy—to divide itself into “New Consumer” and “LTL Management LLC” (LTL). LTL files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the first time. In this initial bankruptcy attempt, the company offers $2 billion to settle cancer-related lawsuits.November 2021: Johnson &amp; Johnson announces plans to separate its pharmaceutical and medical device businesses from its consumer products division in order to “pursue more targeted business strategies and accelerate growth.”February 2022: The United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey expresses the “strong conviction that the bankruptcy court is the optimal venue for redressing the harms of both present and future talc claimants in this case—ensuring a meaningful, timely, and equitable recovery.”August 2022: J&amp;J says it will discontinue sales of its talc-based baby powder globally in 2023, offering a cornstarch version instead.January 2023: The Third Circuit Court of Appeals dismisses the original Chapter 11 petition made by LTL. It claims the New Consumer-funded LTL does not meet a prerequisite for bankruptcy: being in a state of financial distress.April 2023: J&amp;J discloses the new offer in connection with its decision to re-file its subsidiary LTL Management in Chapter 11 bankruptcy. This time around, it has addressed the Third Circuit’s concerns about the support J&amp;J provided to LTL, and its relying on well-established legal precedent.Do J&amp;J’s talc-based products cause cancer?The thousands of claims in question allege that various versions of J&amp;J’s cosmetic talc, including the company’s iconic 130-year-old baby powder, causes ovarian cancer and mesothelioma.In its natural form, some talc contains asbestos, which is cancerous when inhaled, according to the American Cancer Society. However, all talcum products used in US homes have been asbestos-free since the 1970s, says the society.Ovacome, a UK organization dedicated to helping women with ovarian cancer, warns against ascertaining a cause-and-effect relationship in talc and cancer fact sheet (pdf). “We still do not know what really causes ovarian cancer. But it is likely to be a combination of many different inherited and environmental factors, rather than one cause such as talc,” it explained.Still, Johnson &amp; Johnson can’t run scot-free. For one, until the 2000s, some J&amp;J talc did contain asbestos, a 2018 Reuters investigation revealed. And while some judges have tossed out cases based on the weak science, others have sided with consumers who accused the company of not disclosing known risks and fined the company millions of dollars.Related stories🔬 Scientifically, the Johnson &amp; Johnson lawsuits are anything but open-and-shut🤲 Why Johnson &amp; Johnson is splitting its drugs from its deodorantsMore from QuartzThe split of the African plate could gift six landlocked countries a coastlineHow Credit Suisse’s demise strengthens Switzerland’s place in global financeSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

In that same time, the Medical sector gained 0.22%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 2%.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Merck as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be April 27, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Merck to post earnings of $1.42 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 33.64%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $13.8 billion, down 13.2% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $6.87 per share and revenue of $58.51 billion.

In addition, investor uncertainty around the long-term profitability of its streaming business continued, although Disney rolled out price increases and an advertising-supported tier of its Disney+ subscription service during the quarter. The company also changed its leadership, bringing former CEO Bob Iger back to the top job. While disappointed with the stock’s recent performance, we intend to stay patient as the company’s broad reservoir of iconic brands and related franchises provide multiple avenues for long-term value creation. In our view, the broader market continues to underestimate Disney’s franchise value and its earnings power.”6.

(NYSE:JPM):“We regard JPM to be the strongest and best- managed bank in the world. It is a leader in investment banking, commercial banking, credit cards, and asset management. Its size (the largest bank in the USA, with nearly USD 4,000 billion in assets) and diversification give it a strong competitive advantage that is compounded by its cost advantages and the high costs to clients associated with switching banks. JPM’s management prides itself on running the only large bank to avoid major instability over the long term.JP Morgan’s quality and strength first became fully evident in 2008 under the leadership of its CEO Jamie Dimon. Not only did JP Morgan help to stabilize the market by taking over the failing Bear Stearns in the spring of that year, but throughout the Great Financial Crisis it was the only big U.S. bank that did not require government assistance and it was highly profitable even in the difficult year of 2008.A well-functioning and efficient bank can be a very good long-term investment, because the interest compounding effect works well here. JPM’s return on equity (ROE) is well into the double digits and this puts it in a good position to continue producing better long-term returns than does the market. JPM has been very profitable even during years when interest rates were close to zero. The current – and perhaps not temporary – return to somewhat more normal, higher interest rates should have a significantly positive impact on the bank’s interest income and overall profitability.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Dow Stocks To Buy Right Now. Suggested articles:11 Best Dow Jones Dividend Stocks According to Hedge Funds15 Cheap Beginner Stocks to BuyStarter Stock Portfolio: 15 Safe Stocks To BuyDisclosure: None. 12 Best Dow Stocks To Buy Right Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

This takes the annual payment to 2.2% of the current stock price, which is about average for the industry. See our latest analysis for Mosaic Mosaic's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWe aren't too impressed by dividend yields unless they can be sustained over time. Before making this announcement, Mosaic was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to fall by 59.5%. If the dividend continues along the path it has been on recently, we estimate the payout ratio could be 16%, which is comfortable for the company to continue in the future.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityThe company has a long dividend track record, but it doesn't look great with cuts in the past. The most recent annual payment of $1.00 is about the same as the annual payment 10 years ago. We're glad to see the dividend has risen, but with a limited rate of growth and fluctuations in the payments the total shareholder return may be limited.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowGiven that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. Mosaic has impressed us by growing EPS at 60% per year over the past five years. Earnings have been growing rapidly, and with a low payout ratio we think that the company could turn out to be a great dividend stock.Mosaic Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. The distributions are easily covered by earnings, and there is plenty of cash being generated as well. However, it is worth noting that the earnings are expected to fall over the next year, which may not change the long term outlook, but could affect the dividend payment in the next 12 months. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Story continuesIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

You can skip our detailed analysis of stocks in high-interest rate periods and the performance of dividend stocks, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks For Rising Interest Rates. The continuous interest rate hikes have been a cause of investors’ worry for quite some time now. On March 22, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter point, which was its ninth increase in a year. Moreover, Fed officials expect to hike interest rates to 5.1% by the end of the year in their effort to fight inflation, according to a report by New York Times.Rising interest rates can be challenging for nearly every sector, but some industries tend to perform better than others in this environment. For example, banks and other financial institutions typically benefit from growing interest rates since they charge higher rates on loans and earn more on their investments. Similarly, energy and utility sectors can be safe havens for investors during high-interest rate environments as they have predictable cash flows and solid dividend yields. According to a report by Charles Schwab, the energy and financial sectors returned 5% and 3%, respectively, relative to the broader market, in the year following the initial rate increase over the past five rate hike cycles from 1994 to 2015. Other sectors that outperformed the S&amp;P 500 during this period include communication services, healthcare, information technology, and utilities.Though dividend stocks may experience some headwinds during periods of high-interest rates, the impact is not always straightforward and may depend on the individual stock’s financial position, dividend history, and dividend yields. Companies that have strong dividend histories and solid financial health often outperform their peers and the broader market when interest rates are high. In our previous article, we reported that high-dividend stocks surpassed the S&amp;P 500 in 7 out of 10 rising interest rate periods from 1960 to 2017. We also highlighted the performance of companies with strong dividend growth histories between May 2005 and April 2015, when interest rates were high. The report revealed that the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index delivered an annual average return of 12.3%, compared with an 8.5% return of the Dow Jones US Select Dividend Index. Some of the best dividend stocks include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG).Story continuesIt's important to be careful when investing in high-interest rate periods because higher rates can have a significant impact on various aspects of the economy and financial markets.

During our nearly seven-year holding period, the company’s combination progressed leading to the realization of main catalysts we had identified. These included cost savings, broadened product offerings and an expanded customer base, as well as enhanced distribution capabilities and improved pricing due to scale. In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution. As such, we decided to step aside in favor of what we believe to be a more optimal investment in Blackstone.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Dividend Stocks For Rising Interest Rates.  Suggested articles:12 Best Growth Stocks to Buy for the Next 5 Years15 Best Low Priced Stocks to Buy Now12 Cheap Penny Stocks to Buy According to Hedge FundsDisclosure.

But in the long term, decoupling is a trend that will continue,"" said Henry Gao, an associate professor of law at Singapore Management University, and a long-time researcher of international trade issues.Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.In 2022, US exports of aircraft, engines and parts to China, its largest export market, were worth US$5.53 billion, a small rise from US$4.71 billion in 2021, but less than a third of the record US$18.22 billion shipped in 2018, according to data from the United Nations COMTRADE Database.The US-based Peterson Institute of International Economics (PIIE) attributed the plunge of US aviation exports to China, once a big buyer of Boeing jets, to ""geopolitical differences"".""Out of dependency concerns, China may be especially hesitant to buy Boeing products, after observing how Western countries imposed sanctions on exports of aircraft parts and services to Russian commercial airline fleets, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022,"" said PIIE in a report last month.Stephen Olson, a senior research fellow at the Hinrich Foundation and a former trade negotiator with the Office of the US Trade Representative, said that the decline in trade could be a case of interests diverging when it comes to civilian aircraft.Story continues""China has prioritised the development of a domestic competitor and China's home-grown C919 appears capable of favourably competing with Boeing's workhorse aircraft such as the 737. As the C919 comes online, demand for Boeing jets is likely to decline further,"" said Oslon.China has invested heavily into the development of its narrow body passenger jet, which is designed to compete with Boeing's 737 and Airbus' A320.After more than 14 years of development, the C919 received certification last year and is expected to go into commercial operation early this year. However, key components, including its engine, are still imported, many of which are from US manufacturers.Boeing's sales in China have tumbled since 2018. Its 737 MAX only returned to service in January after being grounded in the country for nearly four years following two deadly crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia.In January, Dave Calhoun, chief executive of Boeing, voiced hopes in an interview with Bloomberg that a coming visit to China by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken would lead eventually to ""robust"" plane orders.However, Blinken subsequently postponed his visit to Beijing after a suspected Chinese spy balloon was tracked flying across the US in what Washington called a ""clear violation"" of its sovereignty.Other US business executives in aviation have argued a loss of access to the Chinese market would mean a reduction in US manufacturing output, falling revenues for the firms involved, and thus American job losses and reduced research and development spending.US Trade Representative Katherine Tai told Bloomberg in October that Boeing is a ""very important stakeholder"", but the company on its own does not determine US trade policy.Olson said while Tai's comments did not point to a total decoupling, they signalled the days in which companies essentially had carte blanche to export, transfer, or partner with Chinese entities on the development of sensitive technologies is probably coming to an end.""The administration feels that we are in a fundamentally different era now, and strategic considerations, especially surrounding China's access to US technology, will play a greater role in US trade policy,"" Olson said.""The net result could be greater restrictions on the ability of companies with sophisticated technologies like Boeing to do business in China.""The US will continue to keep a close eye on technology trade and investment with China and potentially further ratchet-up its restrictions, Olson said.""It is possible, if not likely, that Boeing's heyday in China has passed,"" he said.Wan Xiangdong, the chief pilot at aviation regulator the Civil Aviation Administration of China, said at an airline safety event last month that ""China-US civil aviation cooperation is an important part of China-US relations"" and that the two countries have ""extensive cooperation in aircraft and airborne equipment manufacturing, pilot training, air traffic management as well as emission reduction"".""Facing the changing situation, strengthening cooperation is the only solution. Civil aviation industries in China and the United States should strengthen exchanges and cooperation on the basis of equality and respect,"" Wan was quoted as saying by state media.Gao said it would be difficult for the US to manage economic relations with China while stepping up export controls.""That would require a delicate balance which I am not sure is possible under the current political environment,"" Gao said.""But the US could learn from the EU's approach, especially the recent call to de-risk rather than decouple from China by EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.""Ahead of her three-day visit to China with French President Emmanuel Macron, which starts on Wednesday, Von der Leyen said it was not viable to decouple from China, but it was critical to focus on reducing the risks posed to Europe.Economically, the European Union needed to ""rebalance"" the relationship and reduce its reliance on China, she said.Wary of growing restrictions on its access to US technology, China has been focusing on increasing its manufacturing capability to reduce reliance on imports.Former World Bank vice-president Justin Lin Yifu, who is now a professor at Peking University, said China's economic prowess, investment in the digital economy, industry chains and the size of its market are among the advantages in innovation, despite struggling in some areas of advanced manufacturing.Beijing will mobilise resources, talent and funding in targeted areas to achieve breakthroughs, Lin said in a speech last month.""Although there are costs, it is not a dead end. We not only have the opportunity to overcome the challenges, but may even create a new path,"" Lin said.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

As a genomics pioneer founded in San Diego in 1998, we have proven-and continue to prove-how unlocking the power of the genome can exponentially improve the human condition.When the company began 25 years ago, it was revolutionary just to decode the genome. Since then, genomics has played a crucial role generating insights into infectious disease, cancer, reproductive health, genetic disease, and more-while improving patient outcomes every step of the way. To date, scientists and researchers have generated more than one billion gigabases of data and sequenced nearly four million people, and potential uses for that data multiply every year. Around the world, our customers and partners are sequencing samples extracted from seaweed, sugarcane, soil, yams, river water, wastewater, gorillas, ancient Nordic bones-the list goes on.​ It's not surprising that over 300,000 studies featured in peer-reviewed scientific publications have used Illumina technology. Today, our workforce is 10,000 strong, with more than 8800 patents in 34 locations worldwide. We're celebrating 25 years of growth by looking at 25 of the greatest impacts that Illumina technology has made to date.1. We advanced sequencing chemistry to be faster, more accurate, and more stable. When we launched the Genome Analyzer in 2007, we introduced the world to Illumina sequencing by synthesis (SBS) chemistry. SBS forever changed how sequencing is done, as it delivers high accuracy and a high yield of error-free reads. In the years leading up to 2022, we created XLEAP-SBS chemistry, which is engineered for longer reads with up to 2× faster incorporation speed and 3× greater accuracy. And because we made this chemistry stable at ambient temperatures, it no longer needs to be packed with dry ice, making it more sustainable as well as accessible to markets that lack the infrastructure for dry ice shipping.Story continues2. We made DNA sequencing more affordable and accessible. In the last 14 years, we helped take the cost of sequencing a human genome from $150,000 to $200, a drop of more than 99%. Getting to the $10,000 genome in 2010 was a major feat, thanks to the Illumina HiSeq 2000. HiSeq made whole-genome sequencing (WGS) possible for labs of all sizes and drove widespread adoption of exome sequencing and noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT). In 2022, we launched our most powerful and most sustainable sequencers to date, the NovaSeq X Series. The NovaSeq X Plus can sequence more than 20,000 whole genomes per year and enables the $200 genome.​3. We're increasing the diversity of available genomic data to better reflect our world. In 2008, Illumina completed the first-ever sequencing of an African human genome, from an anonymous Yoruban man from Nigeria. From the very beginning we have prioritized diversity, and in the years since, our partnerships with Our Future Health in England, PRECISE in Singapore, All of Us in the US, and OurDNA in Australia have allowed researchers to better target mutations specific to certain populations and deliver on the promise of precision medicine for all. Most recently, we announced an agreement between Illumina, Nashville Biosciences, and Amgen to sequence 35,000 DNA samples from African American patients at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. This is the first announcement from the Alliance for Genomic Discovery, created by Illumina and Nashville Biosciences, to perform WGS on 250,000 de-identified patient samples and make them available to pharmaceutical companies looking to develop new, life-changing therapies.4. WGS for newborns in intensive care is on its way to becoming a universal standard of care. In the last several years, a handful of institutions have made life-changing advances in diagnosing critically ill babies with lifesaving speed. In 2015, Dr. Stephen Kingsmore, then at Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City and using a HiSeq 2500, set a Guinness World Record for fastest genetic diagnosis, in 26 hours (now at Rady Children's, he has implemented rapid WGS as a frontline diagnostic). Beginning in 2017, a groundbreaking study went on to demonstrate the value of WGS across five US hospitals. Other programs and studies at institutions from Germany to the United Arab Emirates have begun implementing WGS in their neonatal intensive care units. And in October 2022, NHS England launched the world's first national genetic testing service, promising to sequence severely ill newborns for diagnosis within days. (Read Baby Fitz's story here.)5. Patients with rare genetic diseases are getting answers-faster. In high-income countries, genetic disease patients often remain undiagnosed for up to seven years or more, while in low- and middle-income regions, many families never learn the cause of their child's suffering. This ""diagnostic odyssey"" costs families time and money, and causes frustration and heartache. But WGS is one way to arrive at a diagnosis within weeks. For 10 years, the Illumina iHope program has facilitated pro bono genome testing for more than 1700 children with suspected rare genetic disease across 24 clinical sites in eight countries. Approximately 40% of them have received a diagnosis and up to 78% received a change in their care management as a result. Based on the success of this program, Illumina recently announced an expansion of iHope to China. Illumina has committed to dramatically expanding access to genome testing outside China through a partnership with Genetic Alliance to develop iHope Genetic Health-a program supported by a $120 million in-kind donation of sequencers, reagents, and software to enable dozens of laboratories to provide genome testing in low- and middle-income communities around the world. This effort will reach up to 50,000 patients a year in five years.6. NIPT and carrier screening transformed reproductive health for expecting families around the world. The VeriSeq NIPT Solution, released in 2017, provides fetal chromosomal information through a simple maternal blood test, significantly expanding families' ability to make informed health care decisions. In 2020, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists amended its guidelines, recommending that all pregnant people, regardless of age or baseline risk, receive testing. Prospective parents can test before conception, and embryos produced through in vitro fertilization can be tested. Further, products such as the Illumina Global Diversity Array with Carrier Screening Content v2 (intended for research use only), can screen for as many as 600 different autosomal recessive disorders.7. Our arrays ushered in a new era of large-scale genomics. They changed the research and applied market landscape in applications such as genetic disease testing, agrigenomics, population genomics, and epigenetic research. We began developing array technology in 1998 and launched our first product in 2001. Today it is a $400 million business and a core part of how we address cost-sensitive applications and geographies. Innovations such as the Infinium Global Diversity Array with Enhanced PGx and the upcoming EX workflow will enable service providers to process samples in a quicker, more cost-effective manner that ultimately benefits patients, while the expansion of our methylation array portfolio will enable new insights in population cohorts and has the potential to improve outcomes in oncology and genetic disease testing.8. We helped accelerate the field of precision oncology with comprehensive genomic profiling. In 2018, we introduced a pan-cancer assay designed to identify known and emerging tumor biomarkers. TruSight Oncology 500 (TSO 500) uses both DNA and RNA from subject tumor samples to identify key somatic variants underlying tumor progression, such as small DNA variants, fusions, and splice variants. It can measure tumor mutational burden and microsatellite instability, features that are potentially important biomarkers for immunotherapies. In 2022, we debuted the TruSight Oncology Comprehensive (TSO Comp) in vitro diagnostic kit to help inform treatment for cancer patients in Europe.​ We also launched the first companion diagnostic for TSO Comp, enabling targeted therapy with Bayer's Vitrakvi medicine for patients with NTRK fusion cancer. With Merck, we codeveloped a TSO 500 HRD research assay.9. Liquid biopsy became possible. The ability to detect cell-free circulating tumor DNA from tumors is growing. Clinical researchers see it as a potential alternative to invasive tissue biopsies, and the breakthrough technology can also help with multi-cancer early detection (MCED). With the help of MCED, catching cancer before it spreads increases the overall cancer survival rate by 400%.10. We enabled partners to develop the COVID-19 vaccine without a live virus.In a lab at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center (SPHCC), researchers used a MiniSeq to sequence the sample of a seafood market worker admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on December 26, 2019. SPHCC was one of the first to publish the viral genomic sequence, and it was this sequence that made vaccine development possible in just 10 months, rather than decades. It was also a catalyst for mRNA technology advancements in oncology testing, HIV, malaria, Ebola, and more.11. We responded quickly to the need for widespread sequencing of SARS-CoV-2. On June 9, 2020, we received the first FDA Emergency Use Authorization for a sequencing-based COVID-19 diagnostic test. The Illumina COVIDSeq Test helped pave the way for large-scale, next-generation sequencing (NGS) COVID-19 testing, just a few months into the pandemic. By summer 2021, most of the resulting test data-which was being used to identify viral variants, which could help public health agencies manage the pandemic-was coming from large genomic centers. Countries with limited resources to invest in high-throughput sequencers had far fewer submissions to COVID surveillance networks. Illumina launched the COVIDSeq Assay, which allowed small labs to participate in surveillance. Rural regions like the Yucatán peninsula in Mexico, with its influx of tourists and immigrants, were finally able to detect the variants present in the local community.12. We doubled the number of countries in which we could enable access to genomics. Over the course of the pandemic, it became clear that sending samples across regions and borders to testing labs was not fast or scalable enough to mitigate the spread of new variants. Our customers, particularly global nongovernmental organizations such as the World Health Organization, United Nations Development Programme, and Association of Public Health Laboratories as well as the Illumina Foundation were requesting to have our products available in nearly every corner of the inhabited world. In just over six months beginning in late 2021, a cross-functional, global team at Illumina set up our systems to enable commercial orders and shipments to 88 additional countries and territories across Africa, Asia, Latin America, and Eastern Europe. The feat provided on-the-ground access to genomics to 900 million more people.13. The world got a crash course in genomics. As the coronavirus pandemic unfolded, terms like ""PCR"" and ""mRNA"" entered the mainstream lexicon. Public health officials became recognizable figures, and Illumina was at the ready to share our knowledge about the power of genomics to impact human health with government leaders, health care professionals, and society writ large. In February 2021, our CEO, Francis deSouza, penned an essay for The Economist, calling for a global ""Bio Force"" to track viruses; two months later, deSouza appeared on the cover of TIME magazine when Illumina was named one of the 100 Most Influential Companies.14. Pathogen surveillance expanded around the globe. In April 2021, we committed $60 million in sequencing capabilities to a global pathogen genomics initiative, in partnership with public and private entities. It expanded on the Africa Pathogen Genomics Initiative (Africa PGI) announced the previous October, to build critical public health capabilities in areas of need and bring us closer to the vision of an early warning system for disease outbreaks. (In a matter of months, the number of sequencing labs in Africa grew from seven to 40.)15. We're working to make adverse drug reactions a thing of the past. We're developing pharmacogenomics testing to prevent adverse drug reactions, the most common cause of hospital admissions worldwide and one of the leading causes of death.​ (Watch Mehri's story here.)16. Millions of pet owners were able to improve their animal's health. Our customers brought to market DNA tests to detect canine cancer earlier, and identify a cat's breed, traits, and health risks.17. We are supporting researchers enabling a more sustainable, nutritious food supply.​Every year since 2011, we have awarded one Illumina Agricultural Greater Good Initiative grant. The program spurs critically needed research that will increase the sustainability, productivity, and nutritional density of agriculturally important crop and livestock species. Grant recipients receive donations of Illumina products. Our most recent winners are studying yams in Nigeria, mung beans in multiple regions, honeybees in Germany, and, as announced this year, marine algae in Brazil.18. Genomics began supporting wildlife conservation. Initiatives like our iConserve program have brought the global community together to accelerate environmental and wildlife conservation. Some of iConserve's work consists of facilitating research in comparative genomics of various species, which provides structure to cataloging biodiversity in wild and captive populations. This ultimately supports decisions made regarding species conservation and management. In recent years, we have been able to support research into the genomes of the bottlenose dolphin, red ruffed lemur, western lowland gorilla, and African elephants.19. We convened world and industry leaders to discuss and advance the power and promise of genomics. At the inaugural Illumina Genomics Forum in September 2022, former President Barack Obama, Bill Gates, Nobel laureate Frances Arnold, and other experts shared their insights on genomics and health care​.20. We advocated for reimbursement (and we still do). Since its inception in 2017, our market access team has been working with consortiums, governments, payers, and others to increase insurance coverage for genetic testing. In 2021, the world crossed a significant milestone, with over one billion people across 45 countries reimbursed for genomic tests, cancer therapy selection, genetic disease diagnosis, and noninvasive prenatal testing. The market access team continues to advocate for patient access through innovative collaborations and contracts.21. Our customers and partners used NGS to help protect the environment. Canada's STREAM project sequences river water and sediment samples to advance watershed health monitoring, Checkerspot is using microalgae to create a sustainable alternative to petroleum, and LanzaTech is turning carbon emissions into valuable material commodities-its facilities in China have produced over 50 million gallons of ethanol from industrial emissions, which is the equivalent of keeping over 200,000 tons of carbon from entering the atmosphere.22. The volume of genomic data has exploded-and so have the insights. Ever since we acquired Solexa in 2007, NGS data output has increased at a rate that outpaces Moore's law-more than doubling each year and creating immeasurable opportunities. Today, the amount of total genetic data generated around the world exceeds one billion gigabases. We've made significant improvements to our platforms and product pipeline to provide highly accurate, comprehensive, efficient analysis of this data. We launched Illumina Connected Analytics to empower customers to manage, analyze, and explore large volumes of multi-omic data in a scalable and flexible environment guided by core principles of security and privacy. Illumina DRAGEN Original Read Archive technology performs data compression in the cloud, reducing customers' carbon footprint by up to five times.23. We made big science green science. Last year, Illumina ranked highest in our industry in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. In July 2022, we were the first genomics company whose plan to meet net-zero targets was approved by the Science Based Targets initiative, which includes validation of our corporate greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets.​ In 2021, the company met 59% of its energy needs through renewable sources, and by 2030 it aims to use 100% renewable energy and 75% less packaging. By 2050, it aims to become a net-zero company.24. The next generation of scientists stepped into the lab. We celebrate DNA Day each April, and our 2022 campaign reached more than 90,000 STEM learners, inspiring the next generation of scientists and discoverers​. Illumina has reached over 1 million STEM learners since 2019, and we aim to reach 5 million by 2030.25. We championed a diverse and global workforce. In 2022 alone we received more than a dozen awards and recognitions from companies like Forbes, Newsweek, Bloomberg, and Dow Jones. We also empower our employees-in commemoration of the 25th anniversary, we are providing twenty-five $25,000 grants in communities where we operate, and we have provided $25 to each employee to donate to a cause of their choice.And in the next 25 years-or even 25 weeks-starting with the debut of Illumina Complete Long Read sequencing technology, stay tuned for more breakthroughs in cardiovascular disease testing, drug target discovery using AI-based genome interpretation and analysis, and expanded testing capabilities for countries most impacted by tuberculosis. In the meantime, our customers are making strides in research for autism spectrum disorder, PTSD, diabetes, and more.For a quarter-century, Illumina has been on the forefront of a global genomics movement. We celebrate this milestone with excitement and can't wait to see how many more patients are able to experience better outcomes through the power of genomics.

(NASDAQ: ILMN), a global leader in DNA sequencing and array-based technologies, today announced it has already exceeded more than 200 orders for its revolutionary NovaSeq X sequencing system in the first quarter of 2023. The orders represent a diverse customer base spanning research and clinical customer segments in nearly 30 countries, across five continents, all seeking to add NovaSeq X – our fastest, most powerful, most sustainable high-throughput sequencer available.Illumina CEO Francis deSouza visits employees at Illumina's manufacturing facility in Hayward, Calif. earlier this year, to celebrate the first shipment of the NovaSeq X.""The NovaSeq X has enjoyed the strongest pre-launch demand we've ever seen for any instrument, and customer enthusiasm continues to grow,"" said Susan Tousi, chief commercial officer at Illumina. ""Customers are thrilled about NovaSeq X's ability to enable and accelerate new projects that require more samples, more multiomic analyses, and depth of sequencing. In addition, NovaSeq X is proving to be an entry point for customers seeking more power and faster results – about 15 percent of pre-orders came from customers who are new to high-throughput sequencing.""First announced at the Illumina Genomics Forum last September, NovaSeq X offers high-throughput sequencing that is twice as fast and three times as accurate as previous Illumina products. It can generate more than 20,000 whole genomes per year at a cost of $200 per genome. In February, scientists at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, the first recipient of a NovaSeq X, presented data confirming NovaSeq X Plus' performance meets or exceeds that of the NovaSeq 6000. This step-change in performance coupled with the launch of Illumina Complete Long Reads last month, enables customers to run long- and short-read sequencing on the same device, offering flexibility in a simplified and efficient workflow.Illumina continues to lead the genomics industry with the latest and most innovative sequencing technology on-market and is committed to supporting its customers while driving additional orders and growing further adoption of whole-genome sequencing globally.

The decision signals that antitrust regulators are taking a tougher stance on larger industry players buying emerging startups.Read moreChatGPT is getting more nuancedChina is changing its tune on the mRNA vaccineA fresh idea for gathering remote and hybrid employees together“The Commission found that the acquisition would diminish innovation in the US market for MCED tests while increasing prices and decreasing choice and quality of tests. This is extremely concerning given the importance of swiftly developing effective and affordable tools to detect cancer early,” the FTC said in a statement.All four FTC commissioners voted in favor of unwinding Illumina’s purchase of Grail, which was closed in August 2021 without a regulatory greenlight. Grail started out as a subsidiary of Illumina, but it was then spun-out in 2016.The FTC decision aligns with the concerns of EU regulators. In September the European Commission announced that it would block the merger, stating Illumina could limit Grail’s competition as the “only credible supplier” of the technology used to process its cancer-detection blood tests.Illumina is not going down without a fight…Illumina announced it would file a petition in a federal appeals court to challenge the FTC decision, and that the order to divest would be automatically stayed until the appeal. It expects a court decision on the appeal to be made by late 2023 or early 2024.The San Diego-based company is also appealing the European Commission decision, stating: “Winning both appeals would maximize value for shareholders.”Story continues…and neither is billionaire Illumina investor Carl IcahnBillionaire activist investor Carl Icahn, who has a 1.4% stake in Illumina, has vocally opposed the company’s purchase of Grail. In a statement published in March he said the deal has cost shareholders $50 billion.Through a flurry of open letters since then, Icahn has engaged in a proxy fight with the biotech company, putting up three “highly qualified” nominees to join the company’s board. Illumina hit back with its own statement saying his board candidates “lack relevant skills and experience.”On Monday (Apr. 3), Icahn published another open letter to shareholders on his site, criticizing Illumina CEO Francis deSouza’s pay rise. According to Icahn’s letter, deSouza’s salary totaled $27 million in 2022, up 87% from 2021. During that time, Illumina saw a 53% drop in value.“The more that occurs, the more we realize that something is truly rotten in the state of Illumina,” Icahn wrote in a recent, barbed missive.Related stories🚫 The FTC may ban non-compete clauses.

That's because the traditional ways people manage retirement may no longer provide enough income to meet expenses - and with people generally living longer, the principal retirement savings is exhausted far too early in the retirement period.The tried-and-true retirement investing approach of yesterday doesn't work today.Years ago, investors at or close to retirement could put money into fixed-income assets and depend on appealing yields to generate consistent, solid pay streams to fund a comfortable retirement. 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s floated around 6.50%, but unfortunately, those days of being able to exclusively rely on Treasury yields to fund retirement income are over.The impact of this rate decline is sizable: over 20 years, the difference in yield for a $1 million investment in 10-year Treasuries is more than $1 million.Today's retirees are getting hit hard by reduced bond yields - and the Social Security picture isn't too rosy either. Right now and for the near future, Social Security benefits are still being paid, but it has been estimated that the Social Security funds will be depleted as soon as 2035.So what can retirees do? You could dramatically reduce your expenses, and go out on a limb hoping your Social Security benefits don't diminish. On the other hand, you could opt for an alternative investment that gives a steady, higher-rate income stream to supplant lessening bond yields.Invest in Dividend StocksAs a replacement for low yielding Treasury bonds (and other bond options), we believe dividend-paying stocks from high quality companies offer low risk and stable, predictable income investors in retirement seek.Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.Story continuesOne approach to recognizing appropriate stocks is to look for companies with an average dividend yield of 3% and positive average annual dividend growth. Numerous stocks hike dividends over time, counterbalancing inflation risks.Here are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.H&amp;R Block (HRB) is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.29 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.27%. This compares to the Consumer Services - Miscellaneous industry's yield of 0% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.71%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 7.41%. Check H&amp;R Block (HRB) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA) is paying out a dividend of $1.4 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.74% compared to the REIT and Equity Trust - Residential industry's yield of 3.85% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 28.74% over the past year. Check Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $0.23 per share, Plymouth Industrial (PLYM) has a dividend yield of 4.26%. This is compared to the REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry's yield of 4.7% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 2.27%. Check Plymouth Industrial (PLYM) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?The fact is that stocks, as an asset class, carry more risk than bonds. To counterbalance this, invest in superior quality dividend stocks that not only can grow over time but more significantly, can also decrease your overall portfolio volatility with respect to the broader stock market.An upside to adding dividend stocks to your retirement portfolio: they can help lessen the effects of inflation, since many dividend-paying companies (especially blue chip stocks) generally increase their dividends over time.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.If you prefer investing in funds or ETFs compared to individual stocks, you can still pursue a dividend income strategy. However, it's important to know the fees charged by each fund or ETF, which can ultimately reduce your dividend income, working against your strategy. Do your homework and make sure you know the fees charged by any fund before you invest.Bottom LineSeeking steady, consistent income through dividends can be a smart option for financial security in retirement, whether you invest in mutual funds, ETFs, or in dividend-paying stocks.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This pullback placed the equity near a historically bullish trendline, though, which presents traders with an interesting entry point.Specfically, SWKS stock just came within one standard deviation of its 40-day moving average. One month after the last four pullbacks to this trendline the stock was higher, and averaged a solid 8% gain, according to Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White.A similar move from its current perch would put Skyworks stock above $124, and past a short-term ceiling at the $118 level. It would also help the security put a dent in its 14.2% year-over-year deficit, and add to its 26.4% year-to-date lead.SWKS Chart April 042023An unwinding of analysts' pessimism could also be a boon for Skyworks Solutions stock. While 11 covering brokerages rate SWKS a ""buy"" or better, 10 still recommend a ""hold"" or worse.Speculating with options could be the right way to go.

(NYSE:TEL) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 2nd of June to $0.59. This will take the dividend yield to an attractive 1.9%, providing a nice boost to shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for TE Connectivity TE Connectivity's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. However, TE Connectivity's earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 20.4% over the next year. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 28% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendTE Connectivity Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.84 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $2.36. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 11% over that duration. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. TE Connectivity has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 18% per annum. A low payout ratio and decent growth suggests that the company is reinvesting well, and it also has plenty of room to increase the dividend over time.We Really Like TE Connectivity's DividendIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Story continuesIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. Earnings growth generally bodes well for the future value of company dividend payments.

295,7013eac7-654f-3b08-b297-55bd96894f0e,NOC,2023-04-05,Raytheon (RTX) Wins $113M Deal to Support MK 15 CIWS,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/raytheon-rtx-wins-113m-deal-121512925.html,1680610512,STORY,"['RTX', 'BAESF', 'GD', 'NOC']","[Raytheon Technologies Corp.’s RTX business segment, Missiles and Defense, recently clinched a modification contract for MK 15 close-in weapon system (CIWS). The award has been provided by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington Navy Yard, Washington, DC.Valued at $113.6 million, the contract is expected to be completed by September 2026. Per the terms of the deal, Raytheon will provide upgrades and conversions, system overhauls and associated hardware for MK 15 CIWS.A major portion of the work related to this deal will be executed in Louisville, KY and Tucson, AZ.Significance of MK15 CIWSRaytheon’s MK 15 Phalanx CIWS is a fast-reaction, rapid-fire 20-millimeter gun system that has been designed to engage anti-ship cruise missiles and fixed-wing aircraft at a short range. The Phalanx weapon system carries out functions such as search, detection, threat evaluation, tracking, engagement and kill assessment, usually performed by multiple systems.Rising air threats worldwide have spiked demand for CIWS in a bid to strengthen nations’ air defense systems. Consequently, Raytheon’s Phalanx MK15 CIWS weapon system has been installed in all U.S. Navy surface combatant ship classes and those of 24 allied nations. This highlights the strong demand that the Phalanx weapon system enjoys globally.Prospects for Raytheon TechnologiesThe rising geopolitical tension across the globe, along with ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, has led many countries to increase their defense budget to improve and modernize warfare capabilities. In such a scenario, spending on high-tech equipment that is most suitable for military operations, gained momentum.Hence, CIWS, with the capability to counter and terminate short-range incoming missiles and enemy aircraft, is likely to witness strong demand going forward. Per the report from Mordor Intelligence, the global CIWS market is anticipated to witness a CAGR of more than 6% during the 2022-2027 period.Story continuesThis indicates abounding growth prospects for RTX as its Phalanx MK15 CIWS boasts features of an efficient shipboard defense weapon system against small, fast and agile surface threats. This, in turn, should bolster the company’s revenues from Raytheon’s Missiles and Defense segment.Opportunities for PeersThe intensifying demand for technologically advanced weapons and arsenals has also spurred demand for an effective CIWS, thereby boosting the market’s growth.Major industry players poised to gain from the surging CIWS demand are General Dynamics GD, BAE Systems BAESY and Northrop Grumman NOC.General Dynamics’ Ordnance and Tactical Systems has been a leading supplier of gun barrels to the U.S. Department of Defense for more than 50 years. It produces weapon systems for U.S. Navy shipboard applications and fighter aircraft, including high-speed Gatling guns for all U.S. fixed-wing military aircraft. Phalanx CIWS was designed and manufactured by General Dynamics.GD’s long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 8.6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 sales indicates an improvement of 4.2% from the previous year.BAE Systems provides a wide range of munitions, explosives, gun systems and artillery systems. Its Mk 38 MGS is a low-cost, stabilized self-defense weapon system that dramatically improves ships' self-defense capabilities in all weather conditions, day or night. Additionally, its Bofors 40 Mk4 gun system, with its high rate of fire and ability to switch between optimized ammunition types, provides high survivability and tactical freedom at all levels of a conflict.The company boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 13.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BAESY’s 2023 sales indicates an improvement of 25.4% from the previous year.Northrop Grumman’s Battle Management &amp; Missile Systems designs, develops and integrates multi-domain command and control in weapons systems. Its Counter Rocket, Artillery and Mortar represents a set of systems used to detect and destroy incoming threats.The company has a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC’s 2023 sales indicates an improvement of 4.6% from the previous year.Price MovementIn the past year, shares of Raytheon Technologies have gained 1.2% against the industry’s 4.5% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankRaytheon Technologies currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

My ?] [? Play ?] is on holdings. The European performance running shoe brand continues to gain ground on the legacy brands. On coming in at number 12 for teens' favorite footwear brand, but that's up from 19 in the spring of last year [? on ?] what was number five when it comes to upper income teens' favorite athletic footwear brand.And the Piper Sandler survey suggests On is taking share away from Adidas, Brooks, and ASICS, those legacy companies. Shares of On, you can see, up more than 4 and 1/2%. Recently popped 20% on that Q4 earnings report, when they told us sales were up 92%.Also in this report, Crocs a very strong brand among teens, ranked sixth. And Crocs-owned Hey Dude is at number 8. So they check in with two of the top 8, and both are up 25% basis points in the Piper survey.Of course, the King remains Nike. They dominate apparel and footwear and increasing their market share after all these years. Nike shares continue to climb up almost 2%. And it's just hard for that not to be my takeaway, that it doesn't matter how much time has passed, Nike owns teens, and they show no sign of stopping. On is really a gainer, never a competitor for Nike, but certainly--SEANA SMITH: For now.- --a gainer.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly. I think the tremendous growth that we have seen in On is remarkable, especially in this economic environment right now. When we heard from the CEO after that last earnings call, he was saying they mostly did not have to discount their products. Compare that even to Nike, which did offer some promotions in its most recent quarter.The brand strength of On is certainly something incredible and I think something that many of these players within the space need to take notice of-- I'm sure they have taken notice of-- the success right there, because what they're doing with Roger Federer, with the name brand-- they're doing everything-- it's almost like a similar playbook to Nike several, several, several years ago.Story continues- But Ali, with Federer, retired athlete, and the price point, I was surprised to see teens are on board with On. Were you not?- Boujie teens. Boujie teens.- [LAUGHS]- Yeah. And Crocs stood out to me, too, because what a turnaround plan that company--- Wow.- --has undergone. Remember when people were just making fun of this company? They signed all those celebrities. They got on Post Malone. I own two pairs of Hey Dudes. I didn't realize they were owned by Crocs at first. They're very comfortable. They're very cool, modern. You can toss them in the washing machine, which I think is a really big attractive element for teens.SEANA SMITH: And they're a good price point too.- And they're a great price point, so--- I've got some coming. I'm excited.- You got Hey Dudes?- Yeah.- Yeah, no. And they're very comfy.- And you know, Crocs was a brand that everyone thought was just a COVID shift, that once COVID passed, people would go back to wearing fancy shoes. It did not. It was not like Peloton. It was not like Zoom. It was not like every other pandemic stock. It continued to grow out of COVID, which is a surprise.SEANA SMITH: Yeah. And their sandals for the women have certainly been a hit recently. But actually, in this survey, among the teens at least, the males made up most of the gain in market share, which took me a little bit by surprise. You got to try a pair of Crocs.- Crocs?SEANA SMITH: No? You're not in yet?- Not a Crocs guy.- I'll try Hey Dudes, but Crocs--SEANA SMITH: You got to do what the kids are doing.- Crocs are--SEANA SMITH: That's what's cool.- 46 years, never been on my feet, and that is not going to change.SEANA SMITH: They're comfy. I'm with Ali.- Yeah, they are.SEANA SMITH: They're very, very comfy.]"

The main factors that brought down several U.S. banks in March are that they had lots of uninsured deposits and lots of unrealized losses in their bond portfolios that would destroy a lot of shareholder equity if the bonds had to be sold to cover deposit outflows.Continue reading]"

(NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX) seeking damages for infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 9,504,651; 8,492,359; 11,141,378; 11,298,320; and 11,318,098 in the manufacture and sale of any COVID-19 mRNA-LNP vaccines. The patents relate to nucleic acid-lipid particles and their composition, manufacture, delivery and methods of use. The filed complaint is available on the Arbutus website.With this suit, Arbutus and its licensee Genevant seek compensation for Pfizer’s and BioNTech’s unlicensed use of patented lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery technologies without which Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccines would not have been successful.William Collier, President and CEO of Arbutus, stated, “During the pandemic, there was an urgent need for LNP technologies to deliver mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines to cells in the human body. We believe that Pfizer and BioNTech could not have created and manufactured effective vaccines at such an unprecedented speed without the existing, proven and patented LNP technologies owned by Arbutus and licensed to Genevant. Therefore, we are pursuing legal action against both Pfizer and BioNTech for the unlicensed use of our patented technologies in their COVID-19 vaccines.”While scientists have been able to easily create mRNA molecules, they struggled to develop a delivery mechanism to ensure the mRNA molecule engages safely and effectively with human cells. This delivery challenge persisted for decades until a team of Arbutus scientists, many of whom are now at Genevant, developed and refined LNP delivery technologies, for which they were awarded many patents. Arbutus’ LNP technologies rely on microscopic particles built from four carefully selected types of fat-like molecules that are stable enough to shelter and protect fragile RNA molecules as they move through the human body to a target cell, and then through the target cell’s membrane, before finally releasing the RNA. These particles are called lipid nanoparticles and their invention was widely recognized as a major achievement that is essential for mRNA vaccines. Without these crucial delivery technologies, the RNA would quickly degrade in the body and be ineffective.Story continuesArbutus also developed the technologies needed to manufacture these LNPs. Previously, methods of manufacturing lipid encapsulants for RNAs used harsh and extreme conditions that would damage the fragile RNA payload. Arbutus developed new, sophisticated manufacturing methods that avoided these deleterious effects.Arbutus remains committed to taking all legal actions necessary to defend and protect its intellectual property.About ArbutusArbutus Biopharma Corporation (Nasdaq: ABUS) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company leveraging its extensive virology expertise to develop novel therapeutics that target specific viral diseases. Our current focus areas include Hepatitis B virus (HBV), SARS-CoV-2, and other coronaviruses. To address HBV, we are developing a RNAi therapeutic, an oral PD-L1 inhibitor, and an oral RNA destabilizer to potentially identify a combination regimen with the aim of providing a functional cure for patients with chronic HBV by suppressing viral replication, reducing surface antigen and reawakening the immune system. We believe our lead compound, AB-729, is the only RNAi therapeutic with evidence of immune re-awakening. AB-729 is currently being evaluated in multiple phase 2 clinical trials. We also have an ongoing drug discovery and development program directed to identifying novel, orally active agents for treating coronaviruses, (including SARS-CoV-2), for which we have nominated a compound and have begun IND-enabling pre-clinical studies.

(NYSE:PFE) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for review the Supplemental New Drug Applications (sNDAs) for BRAFTOVI® (encorafenib) + MEKTOVI® (binimetinib) for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a BRAF V600E mutation, as detected by an FDA-approved test.The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date for a decision by the FDA is in Fourth-Quarter 2023 for the sNDAs. In the U.S., BRAFTOVI + MEKTOVI is currently approved for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation, as detected by an FDA-approved test. BRAFTOVI is also approved, in combination with cetuximab, for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) with a BRAF V600E mutation, as detected by an FDA-approved test, after prior therapy.""For more than a decade, Pfizer Oncology has been at the forefront of bringing biomarker-driven treatment options to patients with cancer. Since their initial regulatory approvals, BRAFTOVI and MEKTOVI have helped improve outcomes in their respective indications of BRAF-mutated metastatic melanoma and BRAF-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer,"" said Chris Boshoff, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Development Officer, Oncology and Rare Disease, Pfizer Global Product Development. ""Through our comprehensive development program, the BRAFTOVI and MEKTOVI combination has shown the potential to help more patients, such as those living with BRAF V600E-mutant non-small cell lung cancer. These sNDAs build on Pfizer’s long heritage of meeting the diverse needs of people with NSCLC, and we look forward to working with the FDA on their review of these applications.""These sNDAs are supported by results from the PHAROS trial (NCT03915951), an open-label, multicenter, non-randomized, Phase 2 study (n=98) to determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of BRAFTOVI given in combination with MEKTOVI in patients with BRAF V600E-mutant metastatic NSCLC. PHAROS met its primary endpoint of objective response rate. Detailed results from the PHAROS study will be presented at an upcoming scientific congress.Story continuesAbout Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)Lung cancer is the second most common type of cancer and the number one cause of cancer-related death around the world.1 In 2023, the American Cancer Society estimates there will be about 238,340 new cases of lung cancer diagnosed in the U.S.2 NSCLC accounts for approximately 80-85% of all lung cancers.3Some lung cancers are linked to acquired genetic abnormalities. For instance, a BRAF V600E mutation occurs in approximately 2% of NSCLC cases4 and stimulates tumor cell growth and proliferation by altering the MAP kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Targeting components of this pathway could potentially inhibit unchecked tumor growth and proliferation caused by BRAF mutations.5Precision medicine is increasingly being developed for NSCLC patients with genetic changes, such as BRAF mutations, that can be detected using biomarker tests.6,7 Advances in targeted therapy have been associated with significant improvements in population-level NSCLC mortality in recent years.8About PHAROSPHAROS (NCT03915951) is an open-label, multicenter, non-randomized, Phase 2 study to determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of BRAFTOVI given in combination with MEKTOVI in 98 patients with BRAF V600E-mutant metastatic NSCLC. The primary endpoint is objective response rate, based on independent radiologic review (per RECIST v1.1); secondary objectives will evaluate additional efficacy endpoints and safety. Duration of response is a key secondary endpoint. The trial is conducted across 53 sites in: Italy (5 sites), the Netherlands (2 sites), South Korea (3 sites), Spain (4 sites), and the U.S. (39 sites).About BRAFTOVI + MEKTOVIBRAFTOVI is an oral small molecule BRAF kinase inhibitor and MEKTOVI is an oral small molecule MEK inhibitor which target key proteins in the MAPK signaling pathway (RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK). Inappropriate activation of this pathway has been shown to occur in many cancers, including melanoma, CRC, and NSCLC.In 2018, the FDA approved BRAFTOVI + MEKTOVI in combination for patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation, as detected by an FDA-approved test. The approval was based on COLUMBUS, a randomized, active-controlled, open-label, Phase 3 trial.In 2020, BRAFTOVI was FDA-approved, in combination with cetuximab, for the treatment of adults with metastatic CRC with a BRAF V600E mutation, as detected by an FDA-approved test. The approval was based on results from the BEACON CRC trial.Pfizer has exclusive rights to BRAFTOVI and MEKTOVI in the U.S., Canada, and all countries in the Latin America, Africa, and Middle East regions. Ono Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. has exclusive rights to commercialize both products in Japan and South Korea, Medison has exclusive rights in Israel, and Pierre Fabre has exclusive rights in all other countries, including Europe and Asia-Pacific (excluding Japan and South Korea).INDICATIONS AND USAGEBRAFTOVI® (encorafenib) and MEKTOVI® (binimetinib) are kinase inhibitors indicated for use in combination for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test.BRAFTOVI is indicated, in combination with cetuximab, for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) with a BRAF V600E mutation, as detected by an FDA-approved test, after prior therapy.Limitations of Use: BRAFTOVI is not indicated for treatment of patients with wild-type BRAF melanoma or wild-type BRAF CRC.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONThis information applies to the safety of BRAFTOVI when used in combination with either MEKTOVI or cetuximab.WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSNew Primary Malignancies, cutaneous and non-cutaneous malignancies can occur with BRAFTOVI.

Chopra said.""There is so much concentrated in a few major cloud providers. So ultimately there needs to be a look at resilience, but also financial stability. And in as much that the financial regulators need to take action, I think we have to seriously consider that.""In October 2021, the CFPB ordered six tech firms — Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Facebook (META), Google (GOOGL), PayPal (PYPL), and Square (SQ) — to provide information about their business practices, including data collection, policies for removing individuals from platforms, and policies for monitoring fraud and addressing consumer disputes.The bureau is also looking at Chinese payment platforms WeChat and Alipay.Rohit Chopra, Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, testifies before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs committee during a hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on Thursday, December 15, 2022. (Photo by Sarah Silbiger for The Washington Post via Getty Images) (The Washington Post via Getty Images)With the rapid adoption of payment apps and services, Chopra says there are questions around how some services decide to kick a merchant or user off the platform, or whether they're collecting data through our phones to move towards personalized pricing.""We have also noticed that, for example, on the Apple devices, only Apple Pay is allowed to use that near-field communication on the device,"" said Chopra.""We hear from other potential competitors, even financial companies, they want to start their own competing apps, but they can't easily break in because they can't always use that tap function.""Story continues""When you can know every single transaction that someone has spent, that's really a map of their mind and their financial life. And I think people want to make sure that that is safe and secure and only shared when they want it to be.""While online payment systems from the likes of Venmo to Apple Pay have gained popular traction with consumers, regulators are watching stablecoins to understand if they could scale quickly. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to a fiat currency, such as the dollar.When asked whether FSOC should designate stablecoins as a systemic risk, Chopra said ""at a minimum, that could provide a bit more visibility into what is backing these stablecoins.""In the midst of three U.S. bank failures last month, the largest U.S. stablecoin issuer, Circle, broke its peg to the dollar briefly before recovering.By law, FSOC can designate certain payment activities, payment clearing, and settlement as either systemic or likely to become systemic.Circle logo is seen in this illustration taken March 31, 2023. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration (Dado Ruvic / reuters)In November 2021, the President's Working Group on Financial Markets recommended FSOC look at designating certain stablecoin activities as systemically important or those that are likely to become systemically important.House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry and Ranking Member Maxine Waters are expected to soon introduce legislation to regulate stablecoins.""I think Facebook's Libra proposal from several years ago was a huge wake up call to regulators around the world that if some sort of virtual currency or stablecoin was on a big tech network, it could rapidly become something that is very big and that is something we would need to be prepared for,"" Chopra said.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

With 59% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of International Business Machines, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for International Business Machines ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About International Business Machines?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that International Business Machines does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see International Business Machines' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in International Business Machines. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.8%. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.0% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.9% by the third-largest shareholder.Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of International Business MachinesThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of International Business Machines Corporation. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$85m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 41% stake in International Business Machines. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand International Business Machines better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted   5 warning signs for International Business Machines  you should be aware of.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

This screen allows me to identify value stocks, which have low P/E and P/B ratios as well as high Zacks Ranks.It is critically important that these stocks also have highs Zacks Ranks, because when looking for value stocks, with low P/E ratios, it can be very easy to fall into a value trap. A value trap is when a stock is trading at a low valuation, and investors mistake cheap, with value. Some stocks have cheap valuations because they are not great stocks, simple as that.Fortunately, by filtering for stocks with high Zacks Ranks, we can ensure that we are buying stocks whose earnings expectations are trending higher. Knowing that analysts are raising expectations is a fantastic signal to investors that this is a stock has a strong chance of outperforming the market.FedExFedEx FDX is the leader in global express delivery services. The company, founded in 1971, provides a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce, and business services.

MPC earned its fourth consecutive ENERGY STAR® Partner of the Year - Sustained Excellence Award, the highest level of recognition in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) ENERGY STAR program. MPC is one of only two companies in the petroleum refining industry to receive the Sustained Excellence Award this year.EPA chooses Sustained Excellence Award winners at its discretion. Winning companies must go above and beyond the criteria for Partner of the Year recognition by showing continuous improvement over time in organization-wide energy savings and environmental performance, demonstrating best practices and actively promoting the ENERGY STAR program.""As we accelerate historic efforts to address climate change, public-private partnerships will be essential to realizing the scale of our ambition,"" said EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan. ""I applaud this year's ENERGY STAR award winners for working with EPA to deliver a clean energy future that saves American consumers and businesses money and creates jobs.""MPC's award reflects company achievements in 2022, including:The refining organization's Focus on Energy program reduced energy consumption by about 20 billion Btu per day from baseline levels. This reduction amounts to conserving 14 tanker trucks of gasoline every day and avoiding 31,700 metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions per month.Six refineries (Anacortes, Washington; Canton, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan; Garyville, Louisiana; Robinson, Illinois; St. Paul Park, Minnesota) received 2022 ENERGY STAR certifications for energy efficiency performance in the top 25% of similar facilities nationwide. This was a record for the most certified refineries from a single petroleum refining company in one year.Four terminals (Cincinnati, Ohio; Jackson, Michigan; Lansing, Michigan; Muncie, Indiana) in MPC's midstream company, MPLX, achieved the ENERGY STAR Challenge for Industry in 2022 by reducing their energy intensity at least 10% within a five-year period.A joint venture partnership with Neste was finalized to progress conversion of MPC's Martinez, California, refinery into a renewable fuels facility. It joins the company's fully operational Dickinson, North Dakota, renewable diesel facility, which is the second largest facility of its kind in the U.S. with a production capacity of approximately 184 million gallons per year.Story continuesMPC received the ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year Award in 2018 and 2019 before earning the company's first Sustained Excellence Award in 2020.

331,69c60c1a-cf91-329d-b6cc-8316cf8f4f3b,MPC,2023-04-05,Will Marathon Petroleum (MPC) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marathon-petroleum-mpc-beat-estimates-161004887.html,1680624604,STORY,['MPC'],"[If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report, you should consider Marathon Petroleum (MPC). This company, which is in the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This refiner has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 17.44%.For the last reported quarter, Marathon Petroleum came out with earnings of $6.65 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.54 per share, representing a surprise of 20.04%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $6.80 per share and it actually produced earnings of $7.81 per share, delivering a surprise of 14.85%.Price and EPS SurpriseWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Marathon Petroleum. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesMarathon Petroleum currently has an Earnings ESP of +2.35%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on May 2, 2023.With the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The order will be booked in the first quarter of 2023.In 2020, Baker Hughes was awarded a contract for North Field East expansion project. The latest order will bring the overall LNG mega trains, driven by Baker Hughes’ energy solutions, to 12.Each MRC train will comprise three Frame 9E DLN Ultra Low NOx gas turbines and six centrifugal compressors across two LNG mega trains for a total scope of supply of six gas turbines to drive 12 centrifugal compressors.Baker Hughes will conduct the packaging, manufacturing and testing of the gas turbine/compressor trains at its Gas Technology facilities in Italy. The company will leverage its service site in Ras Laffan, Qatar, for maintenance and technical assistance services.The NFS project is the planned second phase expansion of Qatar’s North Field, which is the largest single non-associated gas field globally. Once fully completed, the second expansion phase will increase Qatar’s LNG production capacity from 110 Mtpa to 126 Mtpa by 2027.Raising awareness regarding the adverse effects of carbon emissions led to the increasing use of clean energy sources. Due to its clean burning nature, natural gas is a popular choice of clean fuel to generate electricity. As it is difficult to transport large volumes of natural gas, LNG use is a perfect solution.As an LNG technology leader, Baker Hughes commits to supporting the sector to capture, transfer and transform gas in a way that meets rising energy demand and reduces emissions. The project will help position Qatar as a leading supplier of LNG and help unlock more global capacity.Price PerformanceShares of BKR have outperformed the industry in the past six months.

Strong quarterly earnings were primarily driven by increased drilling activity by customers, offset partially by higher total expenses.At the fourth-quarter end, Cactus had cash and cash equivalents of $344.5 million, which can provide it with immense financial flexibility. Cactus had no bank debt outstanding as of Dec 31, 2022.Liberty Energy Inc.’s LBRT fourth-quarter 2022 earnings per share of 82 cents handily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 71 cents. The outperformance reflects the impacts of strong execution and increased service pricing.As part of its shareholder return policy, LBRT repurchased $125 million of its stock at an average price of $15.29 a piece since July and reinstated a quarterly cash dividend of 5 cents per share in the fourth quarter.Marathon Petroleum Corporation’s MPC adjusted earnings per share of $6.65 comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.54. The bottom line was favorably impacted by the stronger-than-expected performance of its key Refining &amp; Marketing segment.In the fourth quarter, MPC repurchased $1.8 billion of shares and another $700 million worth of shares from the start of this year till Jan 27.

The stock hit a new 52-week high of $138.83 in the previous session. Marathon Petroleum has gained 16.5% since the start of the year compared to the -0.1% move for the Zacks Oils-Energy sector and the -0.4% return for the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on January 31, 2023, Marathon Petroleum reported EPS of $6.65 versus consensus estimate of $5.54.For the current fiscal year, Marathon Petroleum is expected to post earnings of $20.31 per share on $130.11 billion in revenues. This represents a -22.36% change in EPS on a -27.7% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $12.08 per share on $122.01 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of -40.54% and -6.22%, respectively.Valuation MetricsMarathon Petroleum may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Marathon Petroleum has a Value Score of A. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.Story continuesIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 6.7X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 6.7X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 3.8X versus its peer group's average of 3.8X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 0.23. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Zacks RankWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Marathon Petroleum currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Marathon Petroleum fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Marathon Petroleum shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.How Does MPC Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of MPC have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is Par Pacific Holdings, Inc. (PARR). PARR has a Zacks Rank of # 1 (Strong Buy) and a Value Score of A, a Growth Score of A, and a Momentum Score of B.Earnings were strong last quarter. Par Pacific Holdings, Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 14.58%, and for the current fiscal year, PARR is expected to post earnings of $7.24 per share on revenue of $6.13 billion.Shares of Par Pacific Holdings, Inc. have gained 2% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 4.11X and a P/CF of 3.12X.The Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry is in the top 22% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for MPC and PARR, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Investors following this investing style typically avoid betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. They believe instead that one could make far more money in lesser time by ""buying high and selling higher.""Everyone likes betting on fast-moving trending stocks, but it isn't easy to determine the right entry point. These stocks often lose momentum when their future growth potential fails to justify their swelled-up valuation. In that phase, investors find themselves invested in shares that have limited to no upside or even a downside. So, betting on a stock just by looking at the traditional momentum parameters could be risky at times.It could be safer to invest in bargain stocks that have been witnessing price momentum recently. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, is pretty useful in identifying great momentum stocks, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced.Marathon Petroleum (MPC) is one of the several great candidates that made it through the screen. While there are numerous reasons why this stock is a great choice, here are the most vital ones:Investors' growing interest in a stock is reflected in its recent price increase. A price change of 2.8% over the past four weeks positions the stock of this refiner well in this regard.While any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. MPC meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 17.2% over the past 12 weeks.Moreover, the momentum for MPC is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 1.64. This indicates that the stock moves 64% higher than the market in either direction.Story continuesGiven this price performance, it is no surprise that MPC has a Momentum Score of A, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.In addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped MPC earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks. That's because as covering analysts raise their earnings estimates for a stock, more and more investors take an interest in it, helping its price race to keep up. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Most importantly, despite possessing fast-paced momentum features, MPC is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. MPC is currently trading at 0.33 times its sales. In other words, investors need to pay only 33 cents for each dollar of sales.So, MPC appears to have plenty of room to run, and that too at a fast pace.In addition to MPC, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens that are strategically created to beat the market.However, keep in mind that the key to a successful stock-picking strategy is to ensure that it produced profitable results in the past.

WHD has witnessed upward earnings estimate revisions for 2023 and 2024 in the past seven days.What's Favoring the Stock?The price of West Texas Intermediate crude is again currently trading at more than the $80-per-barrel mark. The positive trajectory in oil price is a boon for upstream operations like exploration and production activities.Increased investments and activities from upstream firms will also lead to higher demand for engineered wellhead, pressure control and spoolable pipe technologies, which is a boon from Cactus. WHD’s highly engineered products are being used for onshore unconventional oil and gas wells. In the United States, Cactus has a strong onshore wellhead market share.

GM shares down more than 2% about 30 minutes before the close. The company announcing today that 5,000 white collar workers participated in GM's voluntary buyout program. GM now in position to avoid layoffs. A spokesperson saying in an official statement, quote, ""given the results of the program, company wide involuntary separations are not a consideration at this point.""Joining us now to weigh in on this is David Whiston, Morningstar Equity Strategist for US Autos. David, good to see you. So are further cuts coming to GM or is that it?DAVID WHISTON: Well, in autos I guess you never know. But I think as long as the economy doesn't completely fall off a cliff, and that's probably a whole other segment to discuss with an economist-- but I think most of the cost cuts going forward, remember, they did talk about at their last earnings call $2 billion in cost reductions by the end of 2024 is over the next two years and they're getting a billion of it from headcount with the numbers confirm today. So the rest of it's probably coming from other places of overhead, and particularly reducing vehicle complexity, reducing materials build as much as you can-- anything to make the company more efficient, because they've got to compete against not only Tesla, but they've also probably got some cost increases coming with the UAW contract negotiations this summer.SEANA SMITH: Well, David, let's talk a little bit more about Tesla and how GM stacks up. Because with its most recent sales numbers, it now has overtaken Ford as the number two seller of EVs behind Tesla. How much ground has-- I guess how much progress has GM made? And how much more ground do you expect them to cover, narrowing that margin here with Tesla?Story continuesDAVID WHISTON: Yeah, I think people-- the general public when they think of GM EVs, they probably just think of the Bolt. And for a long time, that was true. But they weren't really paying attention to all the other product announcements that had been coming out. And we're just about finally at the point where these are going from announcements to actual vehicles you can buy-- the Cadillac LYRIQ crossover, for example, is already out.Well, first, this spring, you've got the Silverado Bev going to commercial customers this year. And that expands across to the retail channel over the next 12 months. And then in the fall, you've got the Blazer and then the Equinox, I think, is extremely-- a really interesting test, because that's going to be priced starting, emphasis on starting, at around $30,000.And that's really the first attempt at a true mass market EV that has good range and actually has features you'd want to buy. Previously, more, quote, ""affordable"" BEVs were these econoboxes that got you 80 to 100 miles on a charge. And that just wasn't good enough. And that opened the door really nicely for Tesla.But Tesla now has much more competition, not only from GM with the truck, and the crossovers, and the Sierra, but you got the Cadillac Celestiq, a very high end, a $300,000 Cadillac-- it's a really interesting experiment they're doing there, but also across-- look what the Germans are doing, and Ford with the Mustang Mach-E, and their F-150 Lightning-- there's a lot of choices now in the EV space.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, let's dial in a little bit more on Ford. I'd say majority of the press in that space has gone to Ford because of the success of the Ford f-150, Lightning, but them slipping below GM in terms of US EV sales, what's your reaction? How surprised were you by that development?DAVID WHISTON: Well, to be fair, the Mach-E's been out over a year. And then with Lightning, they did have a battery issue-- I've read in the papers that there was a fire that-- it didn't lead to a mass recall, but there was a fire from what I read in some media reports. So they had to stop production in Dearborn on the Lightning for at least five weeks.And that just got resumed very late in the quarter to full production. So between that and the Bolt coming back from the recalls on that old generation battery technology, it's not the ultium technology that's in all the other GM EVs, it opened the door a bit for GM to get some volume. But ultimately, it's going to be about profitability. And when you compare GM and Ford right now, GM's comfortably ahead of Ford in the profitability department.SEANA SMITH: David, when we talk about widespread EV adoption, obviously, there are certainly a number of hurdles. You mentioned the fact that we need a lower priced EV and we need many of those models in order to increase that widespread adoption. What do you think a realistic time frame looks like for this? 2030, is that realistic?DAVID WHISTON: Yeah. It's going to be interesting, because the state of California and the 17, 18 other states that are following California have decided that you will only be able to buy a zero emission vehicle in 2035. And it's-- I think the ratio is 68% by 2030. The Equinox, as I mentioned earlier, referred to your question, that's really the first test of, can EVs have major mass market appeal at that price point and not be branded a Tesla?You know, Tesla really-- they had an opportunity here, I think, to really put a stranglehold on the market. And it looks like they're going to miss that window, although there's plenty of time to go. But you just need a lot more product out. And we need to get EVs to be for everybody, not just for the wealthy.DAVE BRIGGS: If, in fact, gas prices continue to climb off of that OPEC production cut, do you think that can be a catalyst for EV sales moving forward? Or was it the last time we were sitting at $4 plus a gallon?DAVID WHISTON: Yeah, I mean, I think a true panic point might be something maybe north of $5, or even $6, a gallon. So we've got a ways to go still. But the momentum is there. And the regulation's in place to really force it on consumers who don't want it.It's going to be interesting by the end of the decade how many Americans are going to just go ahead and buy an EV even if they don't want to because they may not have that much of a choice. And look at the Buick and Cadillac brands, for example, they'll be all electric by the end of this decade.So it's kind of that battle of will the market accept what, versus the regulation. And, of course, policy makers want to do this for environmental reasons, understandably. But we need more choice, we need more product, we need more infrastructure. That's one thing that was in President Biden's infrastructure bill.And now we've got the IRA tax credit, which we'll find out on April 18 for sure what vehicles are truly eligible for either all of it or at least half of it. But until you get more lithium processing out of China, I don't see too many vehicles getting the $7,500 that GM says that at least some others will be this year.DAVE BRIGGS: Indeed. All right, got to leave it there-- Morningstar David Whiston, good to see you, sir. Thanks so much.]"

The analysts are all in agreement and are all bullish.That's earnings growth of 41.3% as the company made just $4.33 last year.The Stock is CheapShares of Tenaris have fallen 19.2% year-to-date as crude prices have fallen. With the earnings estimates expected to jump higher, the stock is cheaper than its ever been, with a forward P/E of just 4.6.It's also shareholder friendly and has to do something with all of its free cash flow. It has proposed an annual dividend, which will still need to be approved by the shareholders, of $0.34 per share, or $0.68 per ADS, or approximately $401 million. It will be paid on May 24, 2023, to shareholders of record as of May 23, 2023. It goes ex-dividend on May 22, 2023.If investors don't want to own the energy companies directly, a steel pipe manufacturer like Tenaris may be the way to invest instead.[In full disclosure, the author of this article owns shares of Tenaris in the Zacks Value Investor portfolio.]Bear of the Day:Comstock Resources, Inc. was supposed to be flying high in 2023 on higher natural gas prices. Instead, earnings are expected to fall 50% year-over-year and it's now a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Comstock Resources is a leading independent natural gas producer with operations focused on the development of the Haynesville Shale in North Louisiana and East Texas.From Boom in 2022 to Bust?In 2022, with natural gas prices soaring, Comstock generated free cash flow from operations of $673 million, including $129 million in the fourth quarter.Oil and gas sales, including realized hedged losses, jumped 58% in 2022 to $2.3 billion from 2021.It also retired $506 million of debt and conversion of preferred stock.Everything was looking so good, that Comstock resumed its quarterly dividend, which is now $0.125 per share, and is yielding 4.8%.Earnings Estimates Slashed for 2023But as natural gas prices have fallen to multi-year lows, the analysts have slashed their full year estimates.The 2023 Zacks Consensus Estimate has fallen to $1.86 from $4.60 in the last 90 days, with one analyst even cutting in the last 7 days. That $1.86 is a 50.1% decline from 2022, when Comstock made $3.73.A Buying Opportunity?Shares of Comstock are down 21.3% year-to-date. It's cheap, with a forward P/E of 5.6.But until natural gas prices rebound off of 2023 lows, most investors will probably stay away from the natural gas stocks. That presents a buying opportunity for those who believe that natural gas will soon bottom.Remember, the Zacks Rank is a short term recommendation of 1 to 3 months. When natural gas finally turns around, the estimates likely will too.Investors interested in playing the rebound should probably keep Comstock on their watch list.Additional content:Airline Stock Roundup: Pre-Q1 Earnings EditionIn the past week, United Airlines announced plans to invest $15 million in carbon capture technology firm, Svante. The deal is in line with the objective to reduce carbon emissions. In yet another show of the environmentally friendly attitude of airlines, Hawaiian Holdings’ subsidiary, Hawaiian Airlines, entered into a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) sales agreement with biofuel company, Gevo.Hawaiian Airlines was also in the news recently, courtesy of its decision to adjust its schedule to match the anticipated demand swell during summer. That story was covered in details in the previous write-up.Meanwhile, Spirit Airlines also hogged the limelight in the past week owing to its plan to significantly boost its workforce during the current year.Recap of the Latest Top Stories1 United Airlines’ decision to invest $15 million in Svante is in line with its plan to go 100% green by 2050. This is the latest environmentally friendly investment from the United Airlines Ventures Sustainable Flight Fund. Svante provides materials and technology as part of the value chain that has the ability to transform CO2 removed from the atmosphere and industrial emission sources into SAF.UAL’s investment will fund and support Svante’s commercial-scale filter manufacturing facility in Vancouver.This move is in line with the airline’s aim to go 100% green by reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, without relying on traditional carbon offsets. UAL, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has so far invested in the future production of more than three billion gallons of SAF, the most by any airline in the world.United Airlines was also in the news when it reportedly reached two-year tentative agreements with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, the union representing nearly 30,000 ground workers.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here2. Per Hawaiian Airlines’ environmentally-friendly deal with Gevo, the former will purchase 50 million gallons of SAF over five years. Gevo is anticipated to supply SAF from a facility to be constructed in the Midwestern United States and start deliveries to Hawaiian Holdings’ gateway cities in California in 2029. This deal is subject to certain conditions, which include Gevo developing, financing and constructing the facility to produce SAF.3. Spirit Airlines intends to hire 4000 plus employees across various roles (pilots, flight attendants, aviation maintenance technicians and other support center staff) in 2023. Per Linde Grindle, senior vice president and chief human resources officer at Spirit Airlines, ""We're welcoming thousands of new Spirit Family Members across our network this year and have a broad range of positions available for people with all different interests, talents and experience levels."" Given the carrier’s plans to expand its fleet and buoyant air-travel demand, the decision to go on a hiring spree seems to be a prudent one.PerformanceAll airline stocks have traded in the green over the past five trading days. The NYSE ARCA Airline Index has increased 7.5% to $58.57.

354,d125c0f9-ec25-367f-b9b6-2d54ebc92e20,UAL,2023-04-05,United Airlines Holdings Inc (UAL) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-airlines-holdings-inc-ual-130001215.html,1680526801,STORY,['UAL'],"[United Airlines (UAL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this airline have returned -16.6%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Transportation - Airline industry, which United falls in, has lost 5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, United is expected to post earnings of $2.07 per share, indicating a change of +148.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -209.2% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $8.22 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +226.2%. This estimate has changed +8.4% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.75 indicates a change of +18.6% from what United is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +4%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, United is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for UAL _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of United, the consensus sales estimate of $11.41 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +50.8%. The $53.02 billion and $55.46 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +18% and +4.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUnited reported revenues of $12.4 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +51.4%. EPS of $2.46 for the same period compares with -$1.60 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.23 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.39%. The EPS surprise was +18.84%.Over the last four quarters, United surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.United is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about United. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

355,6170174a-7d18-3f14-85aa-f8ac1983dd6d,PNC,2023-04-05,Here's Why We Think PNC Financial Services Group (NYSE:PNC) Might Deserve Your Attention Today,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-think-pnc-financial-103432580.html,1680604472,STORY,['PNC'],"[Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like PNC Financial Services Group (NYSE:PNC). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. Check out our latest analysis for PNC Financial Services Group How Quickly Is PNC Financial Services Group Increasing Earnings Per Share?If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. We can see that in the last three years PNC Financial Services Group grew its EPS by 14% per year. That's a pretty good rate, if the company can sustain it. It's also worth noting that the EPS growth has been assisted by share buybacks, indicating the company is in a position to return capital to shareholders.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. Not all of PNC Financial Services Group's revenue this year is revenue from operations, so keep in mind the revenue and margin numbers used in this article might not be the best representation of the underlying business. PNC Financial Services Group maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 3.3% to US$21b. That's encouraging news for the company!You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. For finer detail, click on the image.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-historyIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of PNC Financial Services Group's forecast profits?Are PNC Financial Services Group Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since PNC Financial Services Group has a market capitalisation of US$50b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$189m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.4% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Does PNC Financial Services Group Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?As previously touched on, PNC Financial Services Group is a growing business, which is encouraging. For those who are looking for a little more than this, the high level of insider ownership enhances our enthusiasm for this growth. That combination is very appealing. So yes, we do think the stock is worth keeping an eye on. Now, you could try to make up your mind on PNC Financial Services Group by focusing on just these factors, or you could also consider how its price-to-earnings ratio compares to other companies in its industry.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features.

It supported 88,601 pre-K and Head Start students, for a total of $1.96M in classroom dreams brought to life.The flash fund kicked off Great Month at PNC, which the company celebrates each April to raise awareness of PNC Grow Up Great® and the importance of high-quality early childhood education. Launched in 2004, the $500 million, bilingual initiative supports programs, resources and experiences that help to prepare children from birth through age 5 for success in school and life.""There's no better way to kick off Great Month at PNC than to help teachers obtain the classroom resources they need,"" said Sally McCrady, chair and president of PNC Foundation. ""Through our work with DonorsChoose, which has ranged from flash funds to matching donations to providing all 61,000+ PNC employees with gift codes to donate to a classroom project of their choice, we can make a direct impact on pre-K teachers' ability to help their students reach their fullest potential.""PNC Foundation to Match Donations to Pre-K and Head Start RequestsFollowing the flash fund today, the PNC Foundation will also match, dollar for dollar, donations that support pre-K and Head Start projects listed on DonorsChoose in the PNC footprint, subject to restrictions and a maximum dollar amount. The match is designed to encourage others to help support preschool programs in public or charter schools and Head Start classrooms. The duration of the match campaign depends on the number of project requests and donations; for specific guidelines, visit donorschoose.org.Story continuesExpanding the Impact for Early Childhood EducatorsThe PNC Foundation's support of DonorsChoose began in April 2017 with an initial flash fund of $504,000, which fulfilled 849 teacher requests in public and charter pre-K classrooms in 22 states and Washington, D.C. Since then, the PNC Foundation has funded over $14 million in pre-K and Head Start projects, supporting nearly 60,000 teacher requests across the company's footprint.The PNC Foundation's initial grant funding to support pre-K classrooms in 2017 enabled DonorsChoose to expand its education funding platform to include project requests from Head Start teachers for the first time. It was the first expansion to reach a new audience of teachers in the 17-year history of DonorsChoose. Since that time, the number of pre-K projects posted in the PNC footprint has grown by 258%, and pre-K projects posted within the PNC footprint outpaced general projects posted by nearly two times.Resources such as art supplies, technology, books and field trips can enhance the preschool learning environment, but many teachers find that funding these resources can be difficult. Recent research from the National Education Association found that well over 90% of teachers spend their own money on school supplies and other items their students need to succeed. One analysis estimated that, in the 2022-23 school year, educators would spend more than $820 out of pocket on school supplies.About DonorsChooseDonorsChoose is the leading way to give to public schools. Since 2000, over 5 million people and partners have contributed $1.4 billion to support 2.5 million teacher requests for classroom resources and experiences. As the most trusted crowdfunding platform for teachers, donors, and district administrators alike, DonorsChoose vets each request, ships the funded resources directly to the classroom, and provides thank yous and reporting to donors and school leaders.

To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT).Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. Check out our latest analysis for Target How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Target is:25% = US$2.8b ÷ US$11b (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.25.Does Target Have A Good ROE?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Target has a better ROE than the average (11%) in the Consumer Retailing industry.roeThat's clearly a positive. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk.  Our risks dashboardshould have the 4 risks we have identified for Target.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityCompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesTarget's Debt And Its 25% ROETarget does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.26. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.ConclusionReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.If you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.Have feedback on this article?

(NASDAQ:ADI) insiders this past year",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shareholders-may-not-want-ignore-110024163.html,1680606024,STORY,['ADI'],"[Despite a 6.2% gain in Analog Devices, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:ADI) stock price this week, shareholders shouldn't let up. Even though stock prices were relatively low, insiders elected to sell US$7.1m worth of stock in the last year, which could indicate some expected downturn.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for Analog Devices The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Analog DevicesOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive Vice President of Global Operations &amp; Technology, Vivek Jain, for US$2.3m worth of shares, at about US$166 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$196, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. We note that the biggest single sale was only 43% of Vivek Jain's holding.All up, insiders sold more shares in Analog Devices than they bought, over the last year. They sold for an average price of about US$174. It's not too encouraging to see that insiders have sold at below the current price. Since insiders sell for many reasons, we wouldn't put too much weight on it. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insiders At Analog Devices Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Analog Devices. In total, insiders dumped US$1.7m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesInsider OwnershipFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Analog Devices insiders own about US$348m worth of shares (which is 0.4% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Analog Devices Insiders?Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And our longer term analysis of insider transactions didn't bring confidence, either. But since Analog Devices is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. While conducting our analysis, we found that Analog Devices has 1 warning sign and it would be unwise to ignore this.But note: Analog Devices may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Broadcom AVGO, Adobe ADBE, Analog Devices ADI, Fortinet FTNT and Mettler-Toledo MTD.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:Avoid the Cryptocurrency Downturn; Add These 5 Stocks InsteadThe cryptocurrency market has been on a roller coaster ride for the past year, thanks to high volatility in the most popular digital currency — bitcoin (BTC) — which holds a dominant position in terms of market capital.According to CoinGecko data, the global cryptocurrency market capital stands at $1.22 trillion as of today, reflecting a year-over-year fall of 46.7%. Bitcoin’s market cap stands at $544 billion, accounting for 44.7% of the total crypto market cap.The sluggish performance of ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) also reflects weakness in the crypto space. In the past year, BITO has lost 39.1%.The massive decline in the major indexes of the U.S. equity market, which has been suffering from the Federal Reserve’s aggressive stance to cut down the inflation rate through continued interest rate hikes, remains the prime reason behind the topsy-turvy crypto market.The Fed raised the benchmark interest rate again by 25 basis points to 4.75-5% in the March FOMC meeting. Chairman Jerome Powell said that the higher interest regime would continue for a longer period in his testimony before the U.S. Congress. Several Fed officials estimated that the terminal interest rate should be 5.375% or more at the end of 2023.Apart from the interest rate hikes, the crash of the crypto exchange — FTX — is a significant reason behind the downturn in the crypto market.Although some signs of improvement are visible from the latest rebound in BTC, rising interest rates and tighter monetary policy continue to ignite uncertainties in the crypto space.Story continuesAgainst this backdrop, we advise investors looking for good investment opportunities to park their money in high-quality tech stocks.Technology Stocks’ ProspectsThe growing proliferation of advanced technologies like AI, Machine Learning (ML), Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain and augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR) is constantly boosting the prospects of the technology sector.The rapid adoption of cloud computing platforms is another positive. Rising 5G deployment, along with solid uptake of autonomous vehicles, cyber security solutions, wearables, voice assistants and other connected devices, are encouraging for the stocks offering products powered by the above-mentioned technologies.Our PicksGiven the upbeat scenario, we have selected five technology stocks (market cap greater than $20 billion) that are well-poised to grow through the rest of 2023, as these are highly reputed, fundamentally strong and financially resilient.Apart from having solid fundamentals, the stocks have a favorable combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Per Zacks’ proprietary methodology, stocks with such a favorable combination offer solid investment opportunities.Broadcom is benefiting from strength in networking and server storage.

The company’s growing prospects from its strategic deals are other tailwinds. Its VMware acquisition will likely boost prospects in the long run. Its tie-up with Tencent to accelerate the adoption of high bandwidth co-packaged optics network switches for cloud infrastructure is another positive.AVGO currently has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of B.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Analog Devices’ fiscal 2023 earnings has improved 9.2% to $10.60 per share in the past 60 days.Fortinet has been benefiting from the rising demand for security and networking products amid the growing hybrid working trend. It has also been gaining from robust growth in Fortinet Security Fabric, cloud and Software-defined Wide Area Network offerings.Increasing IT spending on cybersecurity is expected to help Fortinet grow faster than the security market. Its focus on enhancing the unified threat management portfolio through product development and acquisitions is another tailwind.

This year, teams of Regions volunteers are getting outside and giving back with impactful activities planned throughout April.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230404005336/en/The ""Regions Navy,"" a group of Birmingham volunteers, floats down the Cahaba River picking up debris. (Graphic: Business Wire)""Every year, we look for different ways to make a difference through Share the Good,"" explained Wendi Boyen, community advocacy and financial wellness manager for Regions. ""Right now, the weather is getting warmer, flowers and trees are blooming, and it’s the perfect time to get our teams together and get out into our neighborhoods, parks, and rivers and join community partners in sprucing things up for the season. It’s a great way of making a visible impact, and it deepens our relationships with organizations that support the quality of life in the communities we serve.""Share the Good directly complements Regions’ ongoing focus on volunteer service. In 2022, Regions associates provided 74,000 hours of volunteerism through a variety of programs, including Share the Good.Share the Good initiatives will continue through April 30. Local highlights include:Birmingham, Ala.: The Regions Navy is banding together once again to help clean up the Cahaba River, located just outside Regions’ headquarters city. The group of volunteers will hop aboard canoes and walk the riverbanks to pick up debris along this favorite waterway in support of the Cahaba River Society. The river is an important watershed with rich biodiversity, including a unique native water lily – appropriately named the Cahaba Lily.Austin, Texas: Regions associates in Austin are going back to school for Share the Good. A group of volunteers will be helping students learn the benefits of conservation while encouraging STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) education. These young scientists will be learning to use water purification kits provided by Elequa, a Regions community partner and winner in last year’s Philanthropitch, a ""fast-pitch"" competition that provides training, capital and exposure for local nonprofits.Cleveland, Tenn.: Regions associates are spending quality time at City Fields, where they’ll help plant community gardens and spruce up flower beds. The Alabama-based Regions Foundation, a nonprofit initiative that is funded primarily by Regions Bank, recently presented a grant to City Fields to support access to housing and economic mobility for people who live in the East Cleveland community.Pensacola, Fla.: Regions associates in Pensacola love their beaches (who doesn’t?), and during Share the Good, volunteers will be putting their sunscreen to work in a different way by picking up litter and making sure this coastline, well known for white, sugary sand and clear, blue-green water, keeps its Emerald Coast moniker.St. Louis, Mo.: Regions Bank Market Executive Scott Hartwig knows how to motivate people! He generously offered to treat a group of Regions volunteers to a tailgate lunch from his RV to show appreciation for their hard work ‘sharing the good.’ The team is all in – and looking forward to a productive morning of removing trash and debris along the Mississippi Greenway at North Riverfront Park.Jonesboro, Ark.: Regions teams are volunteering at Arkansas State University’s Earth Day celebration. The event hosts large crowds, including more than 1,000 elementary school students, and offers programs around recycling, conservation and earth-friendly practices. Regions is also supporting Jonesboro’s Great Outdoors Business Expo.Story continuesTo encourage participation and provide inspiration, Regions will host a photo contest for associates. Submissions will be featured on the internal RegionsTV each week in April, and winners will be announced at the end of the month. Winning entries will receive a donation to the community partner they collaborated with for their event.Community engagement is a significant part of the culture at Regions and is fostered through a variety of ongoing programs. For example, every year, Regions offers associates a paid day off to volunteer in their community. Further, as part of its Making Life Better Institute, the bank connects associates with a wide range of ongoing volunteerism opportunities that align with their skills and experience.

383,f2986c45-07d9-3423-b914-6f26ec2d4a0e,MAR,2023-04-05,"Over-the-top bar and restaurant scene, high-rise hotels set to open in downtown L.A.",LA Times,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/over-top-bar-restaurant-scene-120035233.html,1680523235,STORY,['MAR'],"[A view of Figueroa Street and downtown Los Angeles from the Moxy hotel. (Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times)A high-rise with two hotels and an over-the-top restaurant and bar scene is set to open this month by Crypto.com Arena in downtown Los Angeles as travelers embrace the road again and the hospitality business climbs out of the crater it sunk into during the pandemic.The builders hope that events at the arena and the adjacent Los Angeles Convention Center will drive overnight business to the hotels and help tempt locals to cavort in the 12 bars, restaurants and clubs that will be a prime feature of the Moxy and AC complex at Figueroa Street and Pico Boulevard.Moxy and AC are hotel brands operated by Marriott International, which is already the biggest hotelier in the neighborhood with the JW Marriott and Ritz-Carlton at L.A. Live as well as an adjacent tower containing both Courtyard and Residence Inn hotels.A lounge at the AC Hotel includes work stations. (Robert Gauthier/Los Angeles Times)Marriott put multiple brands in downtown L.A. to serve a range of reasons people travel such as leisure, business and conferences, said Chief Executive Anthony Capuano. With the new hotels, Marriott will manage 3,200 rooms in six inns.The hostelries are part of billions of dollars of development that has transformed the once-blighted South Park neighborhood, starting with the completion of then-Staples Center in 1999 and followed by the L.A. Live hotel, office and entertainment center in 2007 that anchored a wave of investment.""The L.A. Live complex transformed the urban core of the city,"" said Capuano, who had a key role in putting Marriott hotels there. ""Downtown used to be pretty sleepy after about 5 p.m.""Part of a long block that last held a parking lot and a Hooters restaurant is now home to the new skyscraper run by Marriott. Next door is the high-rise luxury apartment complex Circa.Among Marriott's newest brands is Moxy, which is cheeky like its name and intended to appeal to younger guests seeking a good time and a lower price point — rooms are small by American standards. AC has a Spanish heritage and is pitched to older guests who prefer a more refined European sensibility.Story continuesMoxy hotels are meant to be ""irreverent and fun,"" said real estate developer Mitchell Hochberg, president of Lightstone Group. His company built the L.A. complex as well as Moxy hotels in New York and Miami Beach.The Moxy lobby has a rammed-earth wall, motorcycle and macrame decoration to evoke a nomadic, desert sensibility. (Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times)Moxy and AC hotels downtown are set to open in April. (Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times)""A lot of hotels are too precious,"" said Hochberg, who was sitting back in a soft chair in the Moxy L.A. lobby with his boots on the table in front of him. ""And too much alike.""The lobby, where guests can check in at the bar, is intended to have a casual, living-room atmosphere. The theme and color palette is ""desert nomad,"" with macrame art, a rammed-earth wall and a motorcycle with a sidecar to bring the point home. A vintage pinball machine is tucked in an upstairs balcony.There are scattered wooden work stations where guests or visitors can plop down and be or at least act productive. Hochberg hopes local residents will be among the people hanging out.""We want neighbors too,"" he said, so ""guests can experience the city they are in"" and not just meet fellow travelers. About half the people hanging out or working in the lobby of a Moxy in New York are not staying there, he said.The attention-grabbing attraction for travelers and locals alike will be Level 8, a spread of eating and drinking venues that cover the entire eighth floor of both hotels — the Moxy and AC are stacked vertically side-by-side in a 37-story tower designed by architecture firm Gensler. The exterior is clad in a 15,000-square-foot electronic billboard, one of the largest in the West capable of projecting a 3-D effect.Prolific L.A. bar and restaurant operators Mark and Jonnie Houston, known for creating playful and theatrical settings to eat and drink, are trying on Level 8 to notch a new high in the zaniness and rakish decadence they are known for.Among their earlier attention-grabbers are Good Times at Davey Wayne's, a 1970s-themed speakeasy in Hollywood entered through a refrigerator and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, a Koreatown nightclub that combines Art Deco with disco. Their Parisian cocktail lounge Pour Vous had burlesque dancers.""We have never tackled anything of this magnitude,"" Jonnie Houston said of Level 8, which will span 30,000 square feet and have eight distinct venues including dining, cocktail bars, a pool deck and a nightclub.Japanese-inspired restaurant Lucky Mizu will be centered around and under an ""earth harp,"" a giant musical instrument with strings that stretch over the audience. Guests will cook traditional hot pot cuisine and steamed seiro mushi entrees at their tables. Another will serve Japanese teppanyaki, where chefs cook flamboyantly on huge griddles. Masked Mexican-style wrestlers will perform in a ring at Sinners y Santos.A speakeasy bar will be entered through what appears to be an old cathedral. The pool deck is expected to have a Miami flavor capped with an outdoor bar under a rotating carousel.Mark Houston said he got goose bumps looking up at the ""massive"" spinning carousel on the corner of Figueroa and Pico. Perhaps, he said, ""It made me feel like how Walt Disney probably felt seeing Disneyland being built.""It's been a hard slog, though, to meet all the safety, health and design requirements of building complicated bars and restaurants far above the street.""I realized why high-rises are so cookie cutter,"" Mark Houston said. ""It's because you deal with so many hurdles that everyone just gives up.""It will take longer to complete Level 8 than the Moxy and AC, which are set to open April 12. The Houstons' complex should be open by the end of June.If the result is as hoped, the Houstons will oversee an attraction that will inspire return visits because, he said, ""You can't do it all in one night.""Ideally for the Houstons and hoteliers, Southern California residents might even decide to turn downtown visits into staycations that last a couple of nights because they are entertained, he said.A room at the Moxy features sparse decor but a wide-ranging view of downtown L.A. (Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times)Moxy's good-time vibe may help it stand out from the competition, said Donald Wise, a hotel investment banker at Turnbull Capital Group who is not involved in the project.""It's all about differentiation,"" he said. ""You're trying to differentiate your box from the box down the street.""Moxy's design flourishes such as the motorcycle in the lobby and the Houstons' sky-high adult playground should tee up tempting backgrounds for people to tout their visits on social media, Wise said.For many, ""Your hotel has to be Instagrammable,"" he said. ""People pick a place to honeymoon or have a vacation or staycation because it's Instagrammable.""The hotel business has seen a substantial recovery since the depths of the pandemic in 2020, industry consultant Alan Reay of Atlas Hospitality said. Leading the way have been travelers eager to kick back at airy resorts.Coastal inns and hotels in other leisure destinations such as the Coachella Valley ""are enjoying record revenues post-COVID,"" he said.Hotels in California urban centers such as San Francisco, San Jose and downtown Los Angeles have also recovered but are still lagging behind their 2019 peaks, he said. Such markets are more reliant on business travelers and conventioneers, who have yet to return in full force.Conventions are coming back ""slowly but surely,"" but the pipeline of events that was shut off during the pandemic has yet to fully refill, he said. ""You don't just flip a switch and put a convention on.""Conventions and group business events will continue to grow, he predicted, as business people seek opportunities for face-to-face meetings that have grown less easy to arrange as offices empty in favor of remote work.Average hotel occupancy in downtown L.A. last year was 71%, a solid rise from 60% in 2021, Reay said. The average price of renting a room went from $210 per night to $265. Rooms at the Moxy will start at $199 and a night at the AC will begin at $219.But even though room rates have bounced back to prepandemic levels, hoteliers are facing inflation and higher costs than they had before, especially labor, Reay said.Los Angeles is experiencing the eighth-slowest recovery of all major markets in the United States in terms of gross operating profit per available room, according to a report by the American Hotel &amp; Lodging Assn. The trade group predicted the region will continue a slow recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic while the hospitality industry’s performance nationwide surpasses 2019 levels.""Overall, the hotel business is very robust right now,"" Wise said.Marriott, Capuano said, is ""cautiously bullish"" on downtown Los Angeles.""There are some challenges that need to be overcome around homelessness and crime,"" he said. ""We want to be part of those solutions"" in part by working with the mayor's office, Los Angeles Tourism and Convention Board and other civic leaders.Capuano lived in Southern California for 15 years, he said, ""so I've got a vested interest in seeing the city continue to grow and thrive.""This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

According to new survey data from Realtor.com®, recent LGBTQ+ and BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and people of color) buyers are going into homeownership weighed down and more burdened by housing costs than white and non-LGBTQ+ individuals.Lower down payment, higher sales price and loan denials creates cost crunch for communities challenged by lower incomesApril is Fair Housing Month and it creates an opportunity to shine a light on the need to create more equitable housing opportunities and access for all individuals. Realtor.com®'s data shows that LGBTQ+ and BIPOC buyers are more likely to put smaller down payments on a home, with nearly two-thirds (65%) putting down 20% or less of a home's purchase price when buying compared to about half (53%) of white, non-LGBTQ+ buyers. LGBTQ+ and BIPOC buyers were also nearly 9% more likely to pay over a home's asking price to get their offer accepted – 86% paid over asking compared to 79% of white and non-LGBTQ+ individuals.A smaller down payment on top of an above-asking home price generally equates to a higher interest rate and monthly mortgage payment, and that means LGBTQ+ and BIPOC buyers are likely to pay a larger share of their income toward housing than other buyers. That's especially challenging for budgets, as a higher percentage of LGBTQ+ and BIPOC homebuyers were also more likely to fall into lower income groups than white and non-LGBTQ+ buyers. Realtor.com® also found that LGBTQ+ and BIPOC buyers face challenges during the mortgage process, and are 1.7 times more likely to have been denied mortgages two or more times.""More Americans than ever before are stretched thin because of the growing housing cost burden, but our data shows that LGBTQ+ and BIPOC buyers are potentially spending even more of their income to own a home of their own, which can make it difficult to afford other essentials like food and transportation and creates even greater inequalities,"" said Laura Eddy, Realtor.com® vice president, Research and Insights. ""With the rising costs of homeownership taking a greater toll on budgets, resources like down payment assistance can help reduce the overall financial burden of buying a home and make it more accessible to a wider range of individuals.""Story continuesDown payment assistance helps reduce upfront costs of buying a homeTo help address the homeownership disparity in America, Realtor.com® teamed up last year with the Homeownership Council of America to donate to and raise funds for HCA's Equity Down Payment Assistance Fund, which helps make owning a home more accessible for BIPOC and low-to moderate-income homebuyers. Since its inception, the Equity Down Payment Assistance Fund has already helped several buyers close on a home, including Jose, a Mexican-American from the Los Angeles area. Jose is a first-generation homeowner and is proud and excited to be celebrating the magic of many ""first"" experiences, like celebrating the holidays with his daughter for the first time in their own home.""I believe there is a huge problem with the homeownership gap and the effects of those gaps go on for generations,"" said Jose. ""Being the first one in my family to purchase a home is definitely a proud moment – I get choked up thinking about it, because my parents came to this country with a dream. Having a home of my own felt like freedom.""There are 5.37 million Americans who qualify for down payment assistance, according to the Urban Institute, but data from the National Association of Realtors®  shows only 3–4% of recent homebuyers have taken advantage of these programs when buying a home. Realtor.com® aims to raise awareness of down payment assistance programs and other tools to help address the homeownership disparity in America.""At Realtor.com®, we believe the dream of homeownership should be achievable by all, but inequality and a history of discriminatory housing policies have made it harder for BIPOC and LGBTQ+ individuals to overcome housing hurdles, and since housing is a predominant way to build wealth, that's led to a significant wealth gap across generations,"" said Mickey Neuberger, CMO, Realtor.com®. ""Reducing unfair housing cost burdens and giving greater access to communities who have been locked out of homeownership opportunities can help address that gap, and it's why we're joining forces with others in the industry and bringing new tools and resources to more individuals to help lift their financial strain.""To increase awareness of down payment assistance programs and make them more accessible to shoppers, all for-sale home listings on Realtor.com® now include information about down payment assistance under the Monthly Payment section. The tool, also available at Realtor.com/fairhousing, puts information about more than 2,000 programs right at consumers' fingertips, so they can quickly and easily find available local, state or national programs by sharing some basic information. The tool's functionality is provided by Down Payment Resource, whose technology matches buyers with assistance programs that meet their individual home buying needs.To watch a video about Jose's home journey, search for down payment assistance programs, and find more Fair Housing tools and resources from Realtor.com®, visit Realtor.com/fairhousing.MethodologyRealtor.com®  conducted a proprietary online quantitative survey in January 2023 among 7,514 consumers who visited a website or real estate app in the last 12 months and who were a primary or shared decision maker of living situations and had no critical industry affiliations.About Realtor.com®Realtor.com® is an open real estate marketplace built for everyone.

These upgrades are part of a multi-year redesign of its network architecture to stay ahead of exponential data usage increases, upgrade the technology in the network, and to pave the way for personalized customer experiences. Network upgrades in Jacksonville include deploying new cell sites to extend coverage and capacity in local communities. They also include adding more capacity on fiber optic cables to move more data through the network and adding bandwidth to the cellular network to accommodate new services like wireless internet service for homes and businesses. Specifics on the upgrades include:64% of people in the Jacksonville area are covered with 5G Ultra Wideband service. Verizon engineers have recently added seven new macro cell sites to add capacity in the Bulls Bay area, West Jacksonville, Holly Oaks in North East Jacksonville, the Sunbeam area, the Beach Haven area near Target and Walmart, the Argyle Forest area, and South Jacksonville area near Royal Lakes-Del Rio. Customers in these areas now have more capacity to experience the speed and security of 5G Ultra Wideband service.In addition to adding more 5G service using C-band spectrum, Verizon is also deploying 5G service using Millimeter Wave (mmWave), its premium, high-band spectrum which allows for extremely fast speeds and massive capacity.  Verizon has recently added nine small cells using mmWave throughout the downtown Jacksonville area.In Jacksonville, Verizon engineers are using CBRS spectrum in the downtown area and have recently deployed five small cells with 4G service using this spectrum. The CBRS band is made up of 150 MHz of 3.5 GHz shared spectrum which until recently has been primarily used by the federal government for radar systems. The FCC authorized shared use of the spectrum with wireless small cells in 2016. By using LTE Advanced technology and carrier aggregation, Verizon is using this shared spectrum to add capacity to its network in the downtown Jacksonville area.Jacksonville’s exceptional 5G coverage uses a combination of mmWave spectrum and Verizon’s recently acquired C-band spectrum.  Verizon engineers are using 60 MHz of C-band spectrum to deliver 5G service to customers. By the end of the year, customers in Jacksonville will be able to take advantage of even more spectrum as it becomes available for 5G Ultra Wideband.  That additional bandwidth will turbo charge the service, offering significantly higher speeds, much greater capacity to accommodate more customers and more robust servicesLastly, the addition of 5G service and the many additional wireless solutions allow far more data to travel on the wireless network in Jacksonville. That exponential increase in data carried into and out of the cell sites serving the community requires upgraded fiber optic cable links.  Fiber optic cables are used to move data between cell sites and connect those sites to the rest of the network.  Verizon has increased the capacity on the fiber connections in many cell sites in the Jacksonville area so they can carry 10 times the amount of data.Story continues“Verizon is committed to delivering the most reliable network experience and meeting our customer’s connectivity needs, no matter where they are. Our reliable, secure network connects families, friends, homes and businesses in Jacksonville, FL with our secure, reliable, best-in-class 5G Ultra Wideband technology,” said Eric Lia, Vice President of Engineering and Operations for Verizon.With these and other technology advancements on Verizon’s network, customers are able to use more data in more ways. This multi-service network powers:Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices that do very little networking and stay in place,smartphones with infinite opportunities to use data in a highly mobile environment,home and business internet which provides connectivity via the wireless network for homes, offices and retail environments, andcomplex solutions like Augmented Reality or enterprise real-time video and data analysis that require massive computing capabilities.As 5G technology advances and is even more widely adopted by consumers the variety of solutions that will use Verizon’s network will continue to evolve as well.Jacksonville, FL customers have the best experience on Verizon’s networkThe recent network upgrades have led to customers having the best experience on the Verizon network in Jacksonville, FL, according to the nation’s most rigorous scientific testing company RootMetrics®.

When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. As with many other companies Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) makes use of debt. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?Why Does Debt Bring Risk?Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. See our latest analysis for Verizon Communications What Is Verizon Communications's Debt?The chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Verizon Communications had US$153.6b in debt in December 2022; about the same as the year before. Net debt is about the same, since the it doesn't have much cash.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Strong Is Verizon Communications' Balance Sheet?We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Verizon Communications had liabilities of US$50.2b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$237.0b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$2.71b and US$25.2b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities total US$259.4b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.The deficiency here weighs heavily on the US$164.7b company itself, as if a child were struggling under the weight of an enormous back-pack full of books, his sports gear, and a trumpet. So we definitely think shareholders need to watch this one closely. After all, Verizon Communications would likely require a major re-capitalisation if it had to pay its creditors today.Story continuesWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.With net debt to EBITDA of 3.0 Verizon Communications has a fairly noticeable amount of debt. But the high interest coverage of 9.6 suggests it can easily service that debt. Sadly, Verizon Communications's EBIT actually dropped 9.7% in the last year. If earnings continue on that decline then managing that debt will be difficult like delivering hot soup on a unicycle. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Verizon Communications can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. Over the last three years, Verizon Communications barely recorded positive free cash flow, in total. Some might say that's a concern, when it comes considering how easily it would be for it to down debt.Our ViewWe'd go so far as to say Verizon Communications's level of total liabilities was disappointing. But on the bright side, its interest cover is a good sign, and makes us more optimistic. We're quite clear that we consider Verizon Communications to be really rather risky, as a result of its balance sheet health. So we're almost as wary of this stock as a hungry kitten is about falling into its owner's fish pond: once bitten, twice shy, as they say. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Verizon Communications , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.When all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

You can skip our detailed analysis of stocks in high-interest rate periods and the performance of dividend stocks, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks For Rising Interest Rates. The continuous interest rate hikes have been a cause of investors’ worry for quite some time now. On March 22, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter point, which was its ninth increase in a year. Moreover, Fed officials expect to hike interest rates to 5.1% by the end of the year in their effort to fight inflation, according to a report by New York Times.Rising interest rates can be challenging for nearly every sector, but some industries tend to perform better than others in this environment. For example, banks and other financial institutions typically benefit from growing interest rates since they charge higher rates on loans and earn more on their investments. Similarly, energy and utility sectors can be safe havens for investors during high-interest rate environments as they have predictable cash flows and solid dividend yields. According to a report by Charles Schwab, the energy and financial sectors returned 5% and 3%, respectively, relative to the broader market, in the year following the initial rate increase over the past five rate hike cycles from 1994 to 2015. Other sectors that outperformed the S&amp;P 500 during this period include communication services, healthcare, information technology, and utilities.Though dividend stocks may experience some headwinds during periods of high-interest rates, the impact is not always straightforward and may depend on the individual stock’s financial position, dividend history, and dividend yields. Companies that have strong dividend histories and solid financial health often outperform their peers and the broader market when interest rates are high. In our previous article, we reported that high-dividend stocks surpassed the S&amp;P 500 in 7 out of 10 rising interest rate periods from 1960 to 2017. We also highlighted the performance of companies with strong dividend growth histories between May 2005 and April 2015, when interest rates were high. The report revealed that the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index delivered an annual average return of 12.3%, compared with an 8.5% return of the Dow Jones US Select Dividend Index. Some of the best dividend stocks include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG).Story continuesIt's important to be careful when investing in high-interest rate periods because higher rates can have a significant impact on various aspects of the economy and financial markets.

During our nearly seven-year holding period, the company’s combination progressed leading to the realization of main catalysts we had identified. These included cost savings, broadened product offerings and an expanded customer base, as well as enhanced distribution capabilities and improved pricing due to scale. In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution. As such, we decided to step aside in favor of what we believe to be a more optimal investment in Blackstone.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Dividend Stocks For Rising Interest Rates.  Suggested articles:12 Best Growth Stocks to Buy for the Next 5 Years15 Best Low Priced Stocks to Buy Now12 Cheap Penny Stocks to Buy According to Hedge FundsDisclosure.

(NYSE:APD) with 86% ownership",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-investors-lot-riding-air-110048899.html,1680692448,STORY,['APD'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Air Products and Chemicals' stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions50% of the business is held by the top 21 shareholdersUsing data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a companyTo get a sense of who is truly in control of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (NYSE:APD), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 86% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).And as as result, institutional investors reaped the most rewards after the company's stock price gained 4.3% last week. The one-year return on investment is currently 16% and last week's gain would have been more than welcomed.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Air Products and Chemicals, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Air Products and Chemicals?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Air Products and Chemicals. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Air Products and Chemicals' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Air Products and Chemicals is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.3% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 6.5% and 5.8% of the stock.Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 21 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Air Products and ChemicalsThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$210m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 14% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Air Products and Chemicals. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Air Products and Chemicals better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Air Products and Chemicals   you should know about.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

This investment will be utilized to upgrade those manufacturing sites to support fuel-agnostic engine platforms that run on low-carbon fuels, including diesel, natural gas and eventually hydrogen.The investment includes a $452 million outlay to upgrade its 998,000-square-foot facility at the Jamestown Engine Plant in Western New York. At this facility, Cummins plans to produce a fuel-agnostic internal combustion engine platform. Walmart, Werner, Matheson and National Ready Mix are some of Cummins’ customers that will start testing the engines of the fuel-agnostic platform, the X15N. Walmart will receive the test unit later in April.In a few weeks, the American engine manufacturer will start manufacturing an essential piece of technology called electrolyzer to produce green hydrogen that will help decarbonize the U.S. economy. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act are crucial in the company’s decarbonization efforts.With the production of electrolyzers in Minnesota and investments in Indiana, North Carolina and New York facilities, Cummins has taken a dual-path approach and will work toward advancing engine-based and zero-emission solutions. The company believes that this approach is suitable for its stakeholders and will create a positive impact on the planet.Cummins' zero-emission technology brand, Accelera by Cummins, in Fridley, Minnesota will soon start manufacturing electrolyzers. These electrolyzers will produce hydrogen that can be used to power hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and in the production of steel. Building electrolyzers in Minnesota is a $10 million investment and an important step towards bringing the supply chain for zero-emissions vehicles to the United States. Starting Apr 24, out of Cummins Power Systems’ 1.1 million square foot facility, 89,000 square feet will be dedicated to the production of electrolyzers.Story continuesZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCMI currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The biorefinery will be powered by the exclusive waste-to-methanol technology platform developed by Enerkem.This electrolyzer system will be comprised of four HyLYZER®-5000s-Accelera's largest electrolyzer product. Each HyLYZER-5000 utilizes 25MW of electricity and can produce up to 10 tons of hydrogen per day. This first-of-its-kind installation will provide the capacity needed to generate clean, renewable hydrogen and oxygen for VCR's conversion of waste material to low-carbon-intensity fuels and circular chemicals. The facility is under construction and scheduled to be operational in 2025.An electrolyzer splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen can be stored as a compressed gas or liquid and used as an energy-dense, clean power source to help decarbonize a variety of hard-to-abate sectors. The VCR plant will use both the renewable hydrogen and oxygen to recycle carbon and hydrogen from waste materials.Cummins launched its zero-emissions technology brand Accelera on March 8, with a broad portfolio of market-leading renewable hydrogen solutions that have been part of many of the world's hydrogen ""firsts.""They include powering the world's largest PEM electrolyzer in operation at 20MW in Bécancour, Canada; the world's first megawatt-scale demonstration plant for storing wind energy in the natural gas grid in Windgas Falkenhagen, Germany; and the world's first hydrogen refueling station for ships, cars, trucks and industrial customers in Antwerp, Belgium.Story continues""Our partnership with VCR illustrates Accelera's role as a global technology leader and highlights our ability to scale hydrogen production across a variety of industries,"" said Amy Davis, President of Accelera by Cummins. ""This project will be the first installation of Accelera's HyLYZER-5000, which generates five times more hydrogen than any of our PEM electrolyzer products currently in use and can accommodate the power needs for large-scale hydrogen production.""Additionally, this is the first time our electrolyzers will power biofuel and circular chemical production, showcasing our unique capabilities to innovate and meet customer demands while accelerating the shift to net-zero emissions.""View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cummins Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cummins Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cummins-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cummins Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/747306/Varennes-Carbon-Recycling-Selects-Accelera-by-Cummins-to-Manufacture-Supply-Electrolyzer-System]"

(CMI) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cummins-inc-cmi-trending-stock-130001333.html,1680526801,STORY,['CMI'],"[Cummins (CMI) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this engine maker have returned -7.4%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Internal Combustion Engines industry, which Cummins falls in, has lost 1.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Cummins is expected to post earnings of $4.53 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1%.The consensus earnings estimate of $18.95 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +25.3%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $19.53 indicates a change of +3% from what Cummins is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Cummins.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CMI _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Cummins, the consensus sales estimate of $8 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +25.3%. The $32.06 billion and $32.07 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +14.2% and +0%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCummins reported revenues of $7.77 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +32.8%. EPS of $4.52 for the same period compares with $2.85 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.36 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.6%. The EPS surprise was -3%.Over the last four quarters, Cummins surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Cummins is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Cummins. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The committee was formed to examine the growing influence of the Chinese government.On this trip lawmakers hope to send a warning shot to big American companies about their dependence on China and urge them to be more mindful of human rights issues. They also want to make it clear they want to work constructively with companies to drive change. Lawmakers, said a source close to the committee, ""are not happy with the status quo.""The trip follows a contentious hearing last month in Washington where TikTok CEO Shou Chew was grilled by members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The hearing largely focused on whether TikTok's Beijing-based parent company ByteDance can ship U.S. users' data to China's government, which could then use it to spy on Americans.Disney's Bob Iger is expected to meet with lawmakers on Wednesday. REUTERS/Hannah McKayThe delegation headed to the West Coast this week has three days of meetings planned, starting with Iger on Wednesday afternoon. Gallagher is particularly concerned after Disney’s remake of the film “Mulan” thanked Chinese government agencies accused of extreme human rights violations in the Xinjiang province.The province is home to detention camps that have held Uighur Muslims, where detainees have allegedly been subjected to terrible human rights violations, such as torture.There will also be meetings with former movie studio execs who want to share their experiences working with China as well as discussions with venture capital firms and leaders from Alphabet's Google (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT) and Scale AI about supply chains and China’s approach towards emerging technologies.The visit will culminate Friday with a lunch meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook.

Ron DeSantis, and the outlook for Disney.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: It's great to have you here with us this morning. All right, if there's any big takeaway that you were able to really get from this shareholder meeting, what really stuck out to you?BRANDON NISPEL: Well, thanks for having me on. I think it's a couple of things, one being that the board is very focused on establishing a succession plan for Bob Iger. Two, Mr. Iger made a clear focus, I think, on transitioning the business towards its core franchises, and then just really reiterating the point that Disney is sort of key to the state of Florida. And it's going to put a lot of investment dollars into the state in their theme park business, which has done really well for them over the years.JARED BLIKRE: And let's just delve into that theme park business. Any additional commentary with regard to that? Because Florida, of course, takes a front stage in this when we think about the theme parks for Disney. But, in fact, they have them around the world. And that has been a centerpiece, kind of a pillar of their business in the past.BRANDON NISPEL: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I think the new comment that Bob Iger spoke about yesterday was that Disney would spend $17 billion over the next 10 years building out theme parks. Some of the data points that I thought were mentioned were a modest positive in that Walt Disney World generates 50 million visitors this year and 8 million internationally. And I think where there's room to go is that international can continue to come back. That was a big thing.I mean, those parks are very profitable ever since Disney reopened them from the pandemic. They've been operating very efficiently. And they generate the vast majority of the company's profitability.BRAD SMITH: OK, and so for the other spaces around the world that Disney is going to want to operate in, it's not, of course, just the parks experience. It's how they can get the digital experience that they've been able to drive into those regions as well successfully. Were they able to add any more color about that and where they're seeing even more international pick-up on their streaming side of the business, even?Story continuesBRANDON NISPEL: We really didn't hear a whole lot more about the Disney streaming business. From our perspective, Disney's core franchises generate vast amount of interest from consumers all across the globe. I think if we ask consumers in just about every country, they have a favorite Disney character.And that really is what drives our view on Disney. We think streaming is going to be a global distribution game. And Disney, from that perspective, should do really, really well.JARED BLIKRE: And how does this parlay into the studios business, that vertical, and the release schedule for the upcoming years?BRANDON NISPEL: Well, I think the new announcement yesterday was that ""Moana"" would be coming back from a live action standpoint. Disney has, ultimately, a pretty wide breadth of content. And one of the things that I think has frustrated shareholders over the past couple of years is just that the cadence of that release slate is generally slow. So we're looking for Disney and Bob Iger to come back and put a little bit of new spark behind that.BRAD SMITH: Now, the different thing going forward is how ESPN is going to be reported for. What detail, what color did they provide on that? And is there any more indication for how investors should be looking at this going forward?BRANDON NISPEL: Disney didn't really provide a lot of detail in terms of how ESPN will look. One of the things that we will be getting from Disney over the next couple of quarters is new segment disclosures, which will show the profitability of ESPN on a standalone basis. And we're really looking forward to that.From our perspective, the linear TV business is challenged in the US. Subscriber losses are in the 6%, 7% range. And we don't really see anything that's going to change that in the near term.However, as we look at it, sports and live news are the two really content genres that are going to do well in a streaming business. And, obviously, ESPN is heavily focused or 100% focused on sports. So we think Disney can outperform some of their peers.JARED BLIKRE: We got time for another. And I'll give you the floor. Anything we didn't catch on that you'd like to touch on right now?BRANDON NISPEL: I think a lot of the pushback from shareholders was appropriate along the lines of Disney's social and political standing. We do have a change in management, right? Bob Chapek did not leave the best taste in shareholders' mouth after he left. With Mr. Iger coming back, I think there's reason to be optimistic.BRAD SMITH: And that optimism, I mean, does that translate into profitability? Is that a shoring up of margins that investors can expect now with Iger reassuming and considering all of the different pleas, not even pleas, demands that some of the more vocal activists have put forward towards Disney as well?BRANDON NISPEL: Yeah, well, I think the core business in itself is going to continue to grow from a revenue-- from an operating income standpoint. And profit should improve and primarily because we're going to get past the peak losses in the streaming business. I think what's added some optimism, too, is this is a business that's going through a phase of restructuring. Disney's announced that they'll be eliminating 7,000 jobs. And as I look at Disney in my cable media telecom coverage list, Disney is by far and away the fastest-growing company that we cover and that we think will be growing over the next three years.]"

Katzenberg – who co-founded DreamWorks and previously served as chair of Disney (DIS) – joined Yahoo Finance to talk AI at Shoptalk 2023, a recent retail conference in Las Vegas.""We looked at the opportunities around AI and are genuinely excited about it,"" he said. ""You're hearing from the grand wizards of our world, like Bill Gates, the people who have really been pioneers over the last generation, and I think everybody agrees that this may actually be the next defining moment in our tech evolution – and with that comes incredible promise. The unbridled enthusiasm we're hearing about today is generative AI, and all of its applications around creativity, storytelling, and art.""""It really is quite spectacular,"" he continued, but with a kicker: ""That's not what I'm interested in.""So, what is Katzenberg interested in? Puneet Mehta, founder and CEO of Netomi, an AI-focused customer service platform Katzenberg has a stake in, has the answer: a safer, more consumer-friendly version of AI called ""sanctioned AI,"" which can only learn from text approved by the company the AI serves.""What sanctioned AI means is that you get to leverage all the great things that generative AI brings to the table, but in a fail-safe environment,"" said Mehta. ""So you need a safety net around it. You need to be clear about what role AI plays. Is it autopilot, where it helps customers autonomously? Or is it a co-pilot, where it's helping an employee?He added: ""You need brand safety filters, what it's allowed to say and not allowed to say. You need it to follow business policy and procedure. You need to be able to audit the work AI has done with relative ease. Then, you need escalation procedures where, if the AI does something wrong, you have somebody step in and save the moment gracefully... So, sanctioned AI lets you use all the amazing capabilities of generative AI, but for the enterprise in a fail-safe mechanism.""Story continuesKatzenberg's WndrCo, an investment firm focused on long-term tech businesses, invested in Netomi in 2021, leading the company's $30 million Series B. Other extant investors who joined that round included Eldridge and Fin Venture Capital.'AI is going to be the new customer interface'For Katzenberg and Mehta, AI is about customer engagement, something that Katzenberg has spent decades thinking about.Big on AI? Jeffrey Katzenberg and Spike Lee back in the day. Richard Mackson-USA TODAY Sports""Through my entire career at Disney and DreamWorks, we were constantly involved with retail, with consumer products, and consumer engagements where, outside of the movie, the movie still lived on,"" said Katzenberg. ""This is a world I love and I've always had great partnerships here.""For Mehta, who spent much of his career as a Wall Street tech executive focusing on AI before founding Netomi, AI has been the future of customer engagement for a while – so it's vital that that AI is managed thoughtfully.""We invented the thesis that AI is going to be the new customer interface,"" said Mehta. ""When a customer talks to a brand in any space, whether it's retail, whether it's travel, or whether it's banking, they would be greeted by an AI first. That's coming true now as we speak."" The best interactions between consumers and AI can and should be as good for the brand as a person-to-person interaction.""I joke often that AI, in the context of customer service and customer experience isn't artificial intelligence, it's access and intimacy,"" said Mehta. ""Could you provide access at those right touch-points when somebody really needs it? He added: The ""intimacy is all about building that trust that the information they're receiving is accurate, and that feeling when you talk to a really great customer support agent that's watching out for you.""Currently, Netomi works with big names across a number of sectors, including HP (HPQ), Warner Brothers Discovery (WBD), WestJet, and Brex. Katzenberg believes that there are more to come.""Today, if you're in the business of dealing with retail customers online or in-person in any fashion, shape, or or form, giving quality customer engagement is not only essential, it may be existential to your brand,"" he said. ""Whether you're a travel company, retailer, or operating through e-commerce, every business today is relying more and more on this type of engagement.""Allie Garfinkle is a Senior Tech Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Ron DeSantis at company’s annual shareholder meeting,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/disney-ceo-bob-iger-speaks-140820788.html,1680617300,VIDEO,['DIS'],"[Yahoo Finance’s Allie Canal joins the Live show to discuss key takeaways from Disney’s annual shareholder meeting.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]- The battle between Disney and Florida escalates after Disney CEO Bob Iger called Florida Governor Ron DeSantis's policies antibusiness at the media giant's annual shareholders meeting. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Cornwell joins us now. My goodness, he said-- he said he's being anti-Florida. That's fighting words right there.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Antibusiness, anti-Florida-- the drama continues and this was one of the first times we've really heard Iger dive into this political firestorm. The CEO of Disney saying a company has freedom of speech just like individuals do and that it was, quote, ""very wrong that DeSantis is attacking Disney for exercising that constitutional right.""Of course, this all stems back to last year over Disney's unfavorable reaction to the so-called Don't Say Gay bill, which forbids instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity from kindergarten into third grade. In response to that DeSantis took control over Disney's longstanding special tax district, formerly known as Reedy Creek. He appointed a new board, hand-selected those members.However, we found out last week that Disney signed a last-minute agreement to essentially render that new board powerless. In response to that earlier on Monday, prior to the shareholder meeting, we found out that Governor DeSantis asked Florida's inspector general to look into this. So a lot of back and forth here.Iger saying he doesn't understand why DeSantis is attacking Disney, especially considering the mutually beneficial relationship that Disney has with Florida. The company revealing that it plans to invest $17 billion at Walt Disney World over the next 10 years, which will equate to an estimated 13,000 jobs. He said it's always been a two-way street. But, clearly, tensions are escalating right now. Iger saying that as a company, they're not going to weigh into every single issue. However, if it's an issue that affects their business or their employees, they're going to speak up and have an opinion about it.Story continues- I was just in Orlando this time last month. I mean, the power line rails are literally shaped in the shape of Mickey Mouse heads. That's how mutually beneficial it's been over years.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Absolutely. It's so beneficial, it's so intertwined, Iger saying we've helped out Florida with taxes, with tourism, community service. And in the same vein, we've been very appreciative of all that Florida has given to us. But, clearly, there are some tensions there that I think are going to continue.- As a kid, I always loved looking at the mouse holes which were in place of manholes. So yes. But let me ask you, they discussed some other things at the meeting as well. Any details there?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, in terms of Disney's overall media strategy, Iger reiterating that streaming is at the core of that business. Because of that, Iger is very antithird-party licensing. He says that it's important to keep that exclusivity of content, especially as Disney's streaming division looks to maintain and reach profitability by 2024 for Disney+ specifically.He also said the company is focused on quality content over quantity content. And to that point, Disney is going to continue to lean on its most successful franchises and temples. There's going to be a live-action ""Moana"" film. Dwayne Johnson revealed the news during the shareholder meeting, saying that he will be reprising his role of Maui. So that was really exciting for a lot of Disney fans out there.But the focus, guys, of this entire shareholder meeting was really on this battle with Ron DeSantis. And I was a bit surprised by that, especially considering there are still major questions out there in regards to the future of Hulu and ESPN. That was not addressed at all on this call.- Yeah, I mean, it begs the question of, especially considering the recent moves that we've seen by Disney in trying to be more cost conscious, cutting their metaverse division even within recent weeks as well, where that digital strategy will get even more prominence in focus as they are also making sure that they're bringing people back into the parks and resorts experiences there and propping up even content that goes into the movie theater side of the business as well.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, and Iger really seemed to emphasize the parks business, too. The new Tron ride, that opens today in Walt Disney World. So that's a big feat that they're focused on. So parks was definitely a big focus, streaming a big focus.You mentioned some of those cost-cutting initiatives. We already saw round one of those 7,000 job cuts. They're going to restructure the business into three different organizations, the parks, the entertainment division, and then ESPN will be its own standalone unit as well.So come this next earnings report, we're going to get specifics on all three of those divisions. So it seems like a new era of Disney. Iger is very clear that he wants to take this company to the next level. We'll see if we can get there. And we'll see how the shareholders react to that.- All right, we know you'll be tracking all things DIS. Yahoo Finance's own Allie Canal, thanks so much, Allie.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Thank you.]"

431,893ae585-6af5-3c31-a23a-871f8ef0447e,FFIV,2023-04-05,F5 Safeguards Digital Services with New AI-Powered App and API Security Capabilities,Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/f5-safeguards-digital-services-ai-110000731.html,1680606000,STORY,['FFIV'],"[Enhanced API defenses, granular machine learning capabilities, and new managed service offerings provide comprehensive protection across distributed environmentsSEATTLE, April 04, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--F5 (NASDAQ: FFIV) today announced new security capabilities to give customers comprehensive protection and control in managing apps and APIs across on-premises, cloud, and edge locations. Specifically, new machine learning enhancements provide F5’s cloud security portfolio with advanced API endpoint discovery, anomaly detection, telemetry, and behavioral analysis. As more transactions and customer engagements occur through digital channels such as web and mobile apps, organizations are seeking better solutions to provide secure experiences for their end users and maintain their trust. With APIs as the building blocks of modern web and mobile experiences, protecting these assets is the cornerstone of securing digital services.F5 customers can now strengthen their security posture with a continuously improving analysis engine and unified policy enforcement. These capabilities enable secure app-to-app communications through validated and monitored APIs, thereby reducing the time security teams spend correcting false positives and accelerating time-to-deployment for new services. The enhancements, as well as new managed service offerings for enterprises and service providers, accelerate the momentum of F5 Distributed Cloud Services, introduced in 2022 and bolstered by the recent launch of multi-cloud networking solutions.Modern organizations continue to demonstrate a clear preference for hybrid solutions. According to F5’s 2023 State of Application Strategy (SOAS) Report, 85% of respondents have deployed apps and APIs in distributed environments spanning multiple public clouds, as well as on-premises and edge locations. More than 20% of respondents are deploying apps and APIs in six different environments. At the same time, security teams struggle to provide consistent protection and visibility for a rapidly expanding attack surface area. This is primarily because many contemporary web application and API protection (WAAP) solutions rely on point products or offerings based on (and provided by) CDN vendor technologies that cannot adequately scale beyond cloud-based apps and lack the ability to be deployed on premises, in public clouds, or in other edge locations.Story continues""Applications and APIs are the building blocks of the digital experiences through which we all work, bank, shop, access healthcare, travel, and play,"" said Kara Sprague, EVP and Chief Product Officer, F5. ""And those experiences are only as secure as the most vulnerable app or API. With greater efficacy achieved via sophisticated profiling techniques and deployment options that span SaaS, packaged software, hardware appliances, and managed services, F5’s app and API security solutions are unmatched. Today’s announcement continues our mission to radically simplify app and API security, empowering customers to accelerate digital innovation with the confidence of comprehensive protection no matter how their apps are built or where they live.""F5 offers a full suite of capabilities to provide robust protection for apps and APIs across on-premises, cloud, and edge locations. Moreover, F5’s end-to-end approach to security means that threat data can be gathered and analyzed across all deployed locations, including ongoing and emerging attack campaigns detected by the F5 Threat Campaigns service. As part of a larger hardware, software, SaaS, and managed services portfolio that also provides best-in-class application delivery capabilities, F5 security solutions protect a diverse mix of distributed apps and APIs in any environment without adding further operational complexity.Enhanced API Security Provides Greater Protection for Modern AppsF5 offerings are firmly in step with organizations’ desire to deploy security capabilities in the public cloud and as-a-service. Unlike API-only point product security providers, F5 delivers API auto-discovery, policy enforcement, and anomaly detection as part of a unified WAAP service, simplifying operations and enforcement through a single console for both app and API protection. Since static signature-based controls are insufficient for protecting API endpoints due to their dynamic, evolving nature, F5 Distributed Cloud API Security utilizes optimized machine learning for automatic API discovery, threat detection, and schema enforcement. By observing normal behavior patterns across all endpoints, F5’s advanced analysis engine helps users detect anomalies and refine API schemas to improve their overall security posture. Additionally, F5 supports token identification to detect anomalous behavior accessing JWT tokens and prevent unauthorized usage.AI as an Essential Element of App SecurityAccording to F5’s SOAS Report, nearly two-thirds of organizations are prioritizing the use of AI/machine learning, with security as a top use case. CISOs view such capabilities as a means to reduce the time between detection and response without compromising efficacy or requiring additional security staff. In addition to AI-based enhancements for Distributed Cloud API Security, F5 is introducing AI-driven web application firewall (WAF) capabilities, including unique malicious user detection and mitigation capabilities that create a per-user threat score based on behavioral analysis that determines intent. This enables security operations to choose between alerting or automatic blocking to mitigate an attack that would otherwise go undetected by static signatures. With F5, all traffic is monitored and proactive defenses are applied based on malicious user behavior that can be correlated across Distributed Cloud WAAP deployments. New functionality also provides false positive suppression, making it easier to block bad traffic without accidentally blocking legitimate users, and streamlines operations by reducing the time necessary to enable specific app protections.Simplifying App Security through Managed Service OfferingsGiven organizations’ growing challenges in deploying consistent security across increasingly distributed infrastructures—as well as finding available personnel with the required security skillsets—F5 is expanding its managed service offerings:Distributed Cloud WAAP Managed Services enable F5 customers to access the experience and expertise of the F5 SOC to manage WAF, bot defense, and DDoS protection. Through a shared console, customers have the ability to seamlessly move between a self-service or managed service model as the needs of their apps and approach to app security change.Distributed Cloud Managed Service Portal enables F5 service provider partners to build and tailor their own managed service offerings based on the leading security capabilities of F5 Distributed Cloud WAAP. This approach lets partners manage Distributed Cloud WAAP on behalf of their customers without sacrificing visibility, resulting in new revenue sources and value-added services while extending the overall reach of the solution.""The beauty of F5 is that they understand each application and provide a solution for that application,"" said Mhd Wail Wajih Khachfa, Chief Information Security Officer, The Department of Digital Ajman. ""For us, F5 is not just a technology provider. They are a strategic partner in our journey to provide the best performance, availability, and security to our customers.""""Just as every business has different risk factors, app security will never be one size fits all,"" said Chris Steffen, Managing Research Director, Enterprise Management Associates. ""Today’s leading vendors recognize that a better approach is to provide integrated capabilities that can take advantage of unified security policies—and enhanced machine learning—across data center, cloud, hybrid, and edge deployments. F5 solutions give customers the flexibility to scale their apps and infrastructure in concert while offering leading security in any deployment context.""Additional ResourcesF5’s 2023 State of Application Strategy ReportF5 Distributed Cloud ServicesAbout F5F5 is a multi-cloud application services and security company committed to bringing a better digital world to life.​​​​​​​ F5 partners with the world’s largest, most advanced organizations to secure and optimize every app and API anywhere—on premises, in the cloud, or at the edge.

Maybe they will for a car, but for a tube of toothpaste maybe they won't,"" she said.Nevertheless, Colgate, like many manufacturers of household goods, has broadly hiked prices on its toothpastes, dish soaps and pet foods over the past year-and-a-half to offset skyrocketing commodity and labor costs.In North America, about 77% of Colgate's toothpaste units are now sold in a recycled tube, Tracy said, a figure she expects to rise to 95% by the end of 2023. Globally 43% of toothpaste tubes were recyclable by the end of 2022, she added.Colgate faces the challenge of making sure consumers recycle the household basic and that facilities properly process the tube.""We're at this chicken-and-egg place where the material recycling facilities are concerned they'll have contamination because not all the tubes are converted yet,"" Tracy said. ""So our goal is to help share the technology to help it get there as quickly as possible.""Story continuesModern recycling plants with automation can process the tube more easily, she said.""We understand the challenge, but if we didn't develop the tube, we would never get there,"" she said.(Reporting by Jessica DiNapoli and Isla Binnie in New York; Editing by Sonali Paul)]"

Organic sales grew for the 16th successive quarter in fourth-quarter 2022, with improvements in all divisions and categories. Innovation, brand strength and digital capabilities also drove organic sales growth.Colgate is on track to improve product availability through enhanced distribution to newer markets and channels.Driven by these factors, Colgate’s net sales improved 5% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in fourth-quarter fiscal 2022. Bold pricing actions and accelerated revenue growth management plans were the key drivers. Revenue growth management initiatives led to double-digit pricing gains worldwide in the fiscal fourth quarter. CL issued encouraging guidance for 2023.An uptrend in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company echoes a positive sentiment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Colgate’s 2023 sales and EPS suggests growth of 4.6% and 4.4%, respectively, from the year-ago period’s reported numbers.However, higher raw material and logistic costs worldwide have led to gross and operating margin contractions for the past few quarters. Notably, the company’s earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the fiscal fourth quarter but declined year over year.The stock has gained 4.6% in the past six months compared with the industry’s growth of 13.5%. The stock also compared unfavorably with the Consumer Staples sector’s growth of 8.8% and the S&amp;P 500’s rally of 8%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Factors Driving GrowthInnovation and in-store implementation have been the guiding principles for Colgate’s growth strategy over the years. The company’s innovation strategy is focused on growing in adjacent categories and product segments.It is also focused on the premiumization of its Oral Care portfolio through major innovations. Products, including CO. by Colgate, Colgate Elixir toothpaste and Colgate enzyme whitening toothpaste, have been performing well, backed by premium innovation.The company is on track to launch Optic White Renewal and then Optify Pro Series in the United States or the new MPS whitening technology to drive long-term growth. CL’s at-home whitening and professional whitening products bode well.Its innovation efforts are highlighted by the continued expansion of the Naturals and Therapeutics divisions, as well as the Hello Products LLC buyout. The company recently partnered with Philips to introduce electric toothbrushes in Latin America, where the use of electric toothbrushes is low. This long-term deal will bring together world’s number one oral care brand and number one manufacturer of sonic toothbrushes under a co-brand — Philips Colgate. The product line will come with a variety of electric toothbrushes at different prices. Further, the new brand will be available in limited countries in the said region.Expanding the availability of products through enhanced distribution to newer markets and channels is one of Colgate’s priorities to improve organic sales. The company is aggressively expanding into faster-growth channels, while extending the geographic footprint of its brands. It is witnessing strong market share gains in North America and China, its two largest markets, with increased share gains across all other regions.Colgate’s Hill's business continues to witness sales momentum, with sales growth of 20% in the fiscal fourth quarter and organic sales growth of 14%. Results have gained from a 13.5% increase in pricing, volume growth of 10% on a reported basis and 0.5% on an organic volume basis, partly offset by a 3.5% adverse currency impact. Organic sales were aided by gains in the United States and Europe.Strength in oral care and pet nutrition are key growth drivers. The company’s newly launched Prescription Diet Derm Complete has been gaining market share and is likely to be rolled out internationally in the coming quarters. Colgate is also focused on expanding the availability of its products through the e-commerce channel, as more consumers are using online services for their essential needs.Management issued an optimistic view for 2023. The company anticipates sales growth of 2-5%, including gains from acquisitions of pet food businesses, offset by a low-single-digit adverse currency impact. Organic sales are expected to be at the high end of its long-term target of 3-5%. The company expects year-over-year reported gross margin expansion, higher advertising investment and double-digit reported bottom-line growth. Also, it predicts adjusted gross margin expansion, higher advertising investment and low to mid-single-digit adjusted bottom-line growth.Story continuesHeadwinds to OvercomeColgate has been largely impacted by the difficult raw material environment across the globe. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2022, the company continued to witness year-over-year increases in raw and packaging material, and logistic costs, as well as volatile currency. The gross profit margin contracted 250 basis points (bps) to 55.6%, both on a GAAP and an adjusted basis. The adjusted operating margin contracted 100 bps to 20.3%. Also, selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses grew 2.2% year over year.Despite pricing gains, Colgate’s sales across some geographic regions continued to be hurt by adverse currency rates in fourth-quarter fiscal 2022. Unfavorable currency impacted revenues by 5% in the fourth quarter.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks that investors may consider are Inter Parfums IPAR, Clorox CLX and Coty COTY.Inter Parfums currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

When you buy individual stocks, you can make higher profits, but you also face the risk of under-performance. Investors in Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) have tasted that bitter downside in the last year, as the share price dropped 21%. That's well below the market decline of 11%. On the bright side, the stock is actually up 4.9% in the last three years.While the last year has been tough for Comcast shareholders, this past week has shown signs of promise. So let's look at the longer term fundamentals and see if they've been the driver of the negative returns. See our latest analysis for Comcast While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Unfortunately Comcast reported an EPS drop of 61% for the last year. The share price fall of 21% isn't as bad as the reduction in earnings per share. So the market may not be too worried about the EPS figure, at the moment -- or it may have expected earnings to drop faster.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Comcast the TSR over the last 1 year was -18%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Comcast shareholders are down 18% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 11%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 5%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

Comcast’s grant will also support NWL’s broader network of over 20,000 Indigenous women across Turtle Island, or North America, grow their businesses, communities, and environment with values-aligned integrated capital.""It’s important for us to design capital, tools, and products that meet the needs of Native communities,"" said Jaime Gloshay, Co-Founder of Native Women Lead. ""As our first corporate partner, Comcast’s grant is truly significant and will help us amplify our work, support our entrepreneurs in reclaiming our narrative, and give us the opportunity to center and uplift the people who are making meaningful change in our communities.""As business owners, Indigenous women face institutional racism and predatory lending when it comes to accessing capital and federal funding. In 2017, the Native Nations Institute found that the number of Small Business Administration (SBA) guaranteed loans awarded to Native-owned businesses constituted less than 1%.Native women also experience some of the highest poverty and wealth gaps in the country. According to the Center for American Progress, they are paid 60 cents for every $1 paid to White, non-Hispanic men, yet 66% are their family’s primary breadwinners and economic drivers in their communities.Story continues""Access to capital remains a significant barrier for women entrepreneurs, but is particularly challenging for Indigenous communities,"" says Dalila Wilson-Scott, EVP and Chief Diversity Officer of Comcast Corporation and President of the Comcast NBCUniversal Foundation. ""We are proud to partner with Native Women Lead to help empower these talented, innovative business owners realize overdue economic opportunities for themselves and their community.""In addition to the Matriarch Revolutionary Fund, Comcast’s grant will help NWL scale and fund the newly launched Rematriating Economies Apprenticeship (REA) program that will support 10 Indigenous women on a five-month paid apprenticeship toward becoming an emerging fund manager. Following the apprenticeship, participants will also be presented with job placement opportunities at several investment fund companies or firms throughout the United States. The apprenticeship is currently accepting applications for its first cohort through April 10, 2023.""We want to see our women writing the checks themselves,"" said Vanessa Roanhorse, Co-Founder Native Women Lead.""I want to see our entrepreneurs thrive – that has been the magic of Native Women Lead. Being able to see someone succeed closes that belief gap in oneself and empowers one another to continue to push and take this journey of entrepreneurship with that curiosity, with that awe, with that wonder, and to be open to the challenges of business ownership,"" Jaime Gloshay added.NWL was founded in 2017 to inspire innovation by investing in Indigenous women entrepreneurs. Today’s grant announcement continues Comcast’s multi-year partnership with the organization and is part of Project UP, Comcast’s $1 billion commitment to reach tens of millions of people in order to advance digital equity and help create a future of unlimited possibilities.About Native Women LeadNative Women Lead’s mission is to revolutionize systems and inspire innovation by investing in Native Women in business. We do this by co-creating with and convening our community to build coalition while honoring our culture, creativity, and connections.

According to a survey by Finimize, 68% of investors polled are expecting the global stock market to be higher in a year. However, in the face of macro uncertainties, such as inflation and a banking crisis, retail investors are becoming more risk-averse. According to Finimize, over 58% of investors plan to reduce their risk exposure over the next quarter. Moreover, 84% of investors plan to invest in stocks, up from 73% in the preceding quarter.Analyst Says Retail Investors are ""Taking Their Foot Off The Gas""On March 25 Finimize's Head Analyst, Carl Hazeley, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance Live where he talked about current investor sentiment and his outlook for retail investors. Hazeley noted that retail investors and institutional investors are both taking a similar risk-averse approach amid macro uncertainty and a global banking crisis.Hazeley said that retail investors are currently ""taking some risk off the table, and taking their foot off the gas"".

In that, retail investors are buying fewer single stocks because of them taking risk off the table. They're (retail investors) looking more towards ETFs when they are investing, and they're looking more closely at fundamentals.""Story continuesHazeley also pointed out some of the top picks of retail investors currently, one of which is Apple Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMD) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“The share price of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) was weak during the quarter and weakened further in early October when the pre-announced revenue was significantly below prior guidance, reflecting an acute slowdown in the PC market. Data centre related revenue grew strongly, albeit below our expectations, while gaming and embedded revenue was in line with our base case.Geopolitical risks have increased for the semiconductor sector, with the U.S. Government announcing restrictions on the sale of certain technologies to China. Despite near term headwinds, AMD is well positioned for the medium term, with a technology lead over Intel in servers for data centres and rapidly gaining share in the PC/notebook sectors. Its gaming and embedded applications continue to grow strongly. AMD is a very capital light business, with manufacturing outsourced. After expending nearly $5b on research and development, AMD generates around $5b of free cashflow. With a net cash balance sheet, we expect management will accelerate buyback activity at a share price well below fair value.The share price of our more cyclical businesses, in particularly the building products companies which have exposure to the U.S. residential, repair and renovation and infrastructure sectors, were broadly flat for the quarter. Rapidly escalating mortgage rates and rapidly reducing affordability will have a pronounced negative effect on near term new residential construction activity. We believe these cyclical pressures are well understood and are more than reflected in current share prices. Overall, we strongly believe share prices are overly reflecting near-term challenges and our portfolio of companies are now meaningfully undervalued.”6.

We are directing our research efforts to identifying names that are closer to the bottom than the top in terms of earnings and valuations, adding to our positions in ASML, the leading supplier of high-end production equipment to chip makers, and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), whose valuation has washed out due to weakness in gaming and crypto mining as well as slowing enterprise spending.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best WallStreetBets Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested articles:12 Cheap Penny Stocks to Buy According to Hedge FundsStarter Stock Portfolio: 15 Safe Stocks To Buy12 Best Low-Priced Technology Stocks To Invest InDisclosure: None. 12 Best WallStreetBets Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

IBP.Industry: Building ProductsLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2074310/4-stocks-to-buy-from-a-thriving-building-products-industryHigher government spending for infrastructural enhancement has been aiding the companies under the Zacks Building Products - Miscellaneous industry. Although the current U.S. housing market slowdown, continued supply-chain bottlenecks, investments in new products and higher raw material costs may keep margins under pressure, companies like Otis Worldwide Corp., United Rentals, Inc., Simpson Manufacturing Co., Inc. and Installed Building Products, Inc. are set to benefit from operational excellence, geographic and product diversification strategies, accretive buyouts and higher infrastructural spending.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Building Products - Miscellaneous industry primarily comprises manufacturers, designers and distributors of home improvement and building products like ceiling systems, doors, and windows as well as flooring and metal products. Some industry players provide solutions to rehabilitate the aging infrastructure, primarily pipelines in wastewater, water, energy, mining and refining industries.The companies also manufacture expansion joints and structural bearings, ventilation products, ground-mounted solar racking and commercial greenhouses as well as mail storage (solutions including mailboxes along with package delivery products). Companies in this industrial cohort also rent out equipment to a diverse customer base that includes construction and industrial companies, manufacturers, utilities, municipalities, homeowners as well as government entities.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Building Products IndustryU.S. Administration’s Infrastructural Spending: The industry players are expected to benefit from strong global trends in infrastructure modernization, energy transition, national security, and a potential super-cycle in global supply-chain investments. The U.S. administration’s endeavor to rebuild the nation’s deteriorating roads and bridges and fund new climate-resilient and broadband initiatives is expected to aid the companies. Meanwhile, although the slowdown of the U.S. residential market is taking a toll on a few housing-inclined companies’ performances, persistent share growth opportunities for certain non-residential areas are expected to drive growth.Story continuesOperational Excellence, Product Innovation &amp; Acquisitions: The industry participants have been carrying out strong cost-saving initiatives like business consolidation, system implementations, plant/branch closures, improvement in the global supply chain and headcount reductions to boost profitability. Industry participants have also been strategically investing in new products, sales and support services, digitally enabled solutions as well as advanced manufacturing capabilities to boost revenues. The companies are also following a systematic acquisition strategy to supplement organic growth, and expand access to additional markets as well as products.Supply Chain &amp; Inflationary Woes: Inflationary headwinds with respect to transportation costs, material costs and energy costs owing to supply-chain disruptions have been a pressing concern. Also, rising labor costs are compressing margins. These are dampening the companies’ operating performance. Rising costs related to steel, asphalt, resin and other input materials are also hurting margins. Although the industry participants have been working to recover higher costs through various price increases, they expect this ongoing volatility in material and transportation costs to persist in the near term.Meanwhile, the companies have been witnessing short-term project delays due to material and labor shortages that are impacting upstream building activity. This may result in a lower backlog in the near term.Apart from higher raw material costs, the companies bear expenses related to product launches. If companies are unable to offset these costs through price increases or supply-chain initiatives, their profits may be affected.Also, as the industry players’ business prospects are highly correlated with U.S. housing market conditions, and repair and remodeling activity, the current slowdown in the market has been impacting the company’s performance.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Building Products – Miscellaneous industry is a 26-stock group within the broader Zacks Construction sector.

The new free version of Oracle Database 23c gives all developers access to the most innovative features that simplify the development of modern, data-driven applications.Oracle Database is among the most popular database management systems in the world, used in a wide range of applications and environments, from small businesses to large organizations.It is one of the most popular RDBMS in the world that offers a wide range of features including transaction processing, in-memory data management, replication, advanced security, lifecycle management, data and more. Oracle Database is highly scalable, reliable and can handle large volumes of data.Oracle Corporation Price and ConsensusOracle Corporation Price and ConsensusOracle Corporation price-consensus-chart | Oracle Corporation QuoteJSON Relational Duality Feature to Boost Developer InterestThere are many new features in Oracle Database 23c, including JSON Relational Duality, a feature that combines relational and documental data models, offering the best of both.Developers can build applications using relational schemas or JSON with a single data source and take advantage of each other's strengths. The data is held only once but can be accessed, written and modified with both approaches. In this way, developers can take advantage of both JSON models and relational models, including ACID (ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Insulation and Durability) compliant transactions that involve a set of properties that ensure the consistency and reliability of operations performed within a database and have concurrency controls, which eliminates tradeoffs in object-relational mappings and data consistency.Expanded JSON support in Database 23cOther features in the new edition include the ability for developers to ensure and validate JSON document structures through structured JSON Schemas.Developers can now build both transactional and analytical property graph applications with the Oracle database using the new SQL standard property graph queries, which enables graph analytics to be run on top of both relational and JSON data.Applications that use the Apache Kafka distributed event streaming platform can now run against Oracle transactional event queues in Oracle with minimal code changes.A new SQL domain construct can act as lightweight type modifiers that centrally document intended data usage, extending and improving upon SQL standard domains. Those are data types with optional constraints that are used to abstract common constraints on fields into a single location for simpler definition and maintenance.Database metadata can now be stored directly alongside the data with a new annotation mechanism inside the Oracle database. Developers can annotate common data model attributes for tables, columns, views, indexes and other attributes to improve consistency and accessibility.Story continuesZacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Oracle carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Continuing one of the fastest expansions of any major cloud provider, the new region is one of 10 planned public regions to join the 41 regions that Oracle currently operates.(PRNewsfoto/Oracle)The region will offer Oracle's public and private sector customers and partners a new option to locate their infrastructure, applications, and data for optimal performance and latency. Customers will have access to a wide range of cloud services to modernize their applications; innovate with data, analytics, and AI; and migrate mission-critical workloads from their data centers to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). In addition, customers will be able to achieve greater business continuity by using both Oracle Cloud Singapore Regions together while retaining data residency within Singapore.""Our upcoming second cloud region in Singapore will help meet the tremendous upsurge in demand for cloud services in South East Asia,"" said Garrett Ilg, president, Japan &amp; Asia Pacific, Oracle. ""With the new region, Oracle offers customers true business continuity and disaster protection while meeting in-country data residency requirements. As a result, we're extending our commitment to helping organizations in South East Asia embrace technologies like AI, machine learning, and IoT to address their most complex challenges and achieve more with less.""Story continuesThe new Oracle Cloud Singapore Region will offer over 100 OCI services and applications, including Oracle Autonomous Database, MySQL HeatWave Database Service, Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes, and Oracle Cloud VMware Solution. These applications and services will help startups and medium-sized and large organizations across financial services, telecommunications, manufacturing, healthcare, and retail in South East Asia harness data to help uncover new business value and optimize applications, typically without requiring costly re-architecture. The first Oracle Cloud Singapore Region has supported the innovation needs of more than 1,000 customers in South East Asia, including Pacific International Lines and Siam Makro.High Availability and Low Latency Provides Customers with a Resilient Cloud FoundationOCI's next-generation architecture maximizes performance and security. Each Oracle Cloud Region contains at least three fault domains, which are groupings of hardware that form logical data centers for high availability and resilience to hardware and network failures. The second region in Singapore will help customers increase business continuity while addressing regulatory needs.Both Singapore regions will provide low-latency networking and high-speed data transfer to allow customers and partners to derive better value from their data. In addition, OCI's distributed cloud solutions, including Dedicated Region and Exadata Cloud@Customer, can assist with applications where data proximity and low latency in specific locations are critical.Spurring South East Asia's Digital Economic GrowthIn its Top ICT Predictions for 2022 and Beyond at IDC FutureScape 2022, IDC said that by 2023 digital will rule in South East Asia, as one in three companies will generate more than 15 percent of their revenue from digital products and services, compared to one in six in 2020. The strong focus on increasing revenue from digital products and services will contribute towards cloud technology playing an even more integral role in business continuity and resiliency for South East Asian organizations in today's digital-first world.""Oracle's second cloud region in Singapore is a welcomed addition as the country continues to establish itself as one of the top markets for data centres globally, with sustainability at its core. Despite economic uncertainties, cloud spending by South East Asia organizations remains strong as cloud adoption continues to be seen as a business differentiator to meet the challenges of the post-pandemic future. IDC forecasts the Asia/Pacific (excluding Japan) overall public cloud services market will increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.5% from US$53.4 billion in 2021 to reach US$153.6 billion in 2026,"" said Estelle Quek, senior research manager, Cloud Buyer Trends and Intentions Research, IDC.A Focus on Driving Sustainable Operations Across the GlobeUnderscoring its ongoing focus on sustainability, Oracle has committed to matching all worldwide Oracle Cloud Regions with 100 percent renewable energy by 2025, including the new Oracle Cloud Region in Singapore. Several Oracle Cloud Regions are already powered by 100 percent renewable energy, which enables customers to run their computing services more sustainably and with a lower carbon footprint. To further advance its commitment to sustainable operations, Oracle and its Asset Recovery partners recycled 99.9 percent of retired hardware they collected in FY'22.Customers and Partners Welcome Oracle's Second Cloud Region in Singapore""We're excited to hear Oracle's plans to launch another cloud region in Singapore. Singapore Pools had a good experience with the first cloud region. With the launch of the second region, this strengthens our confidence for maximum high availability for our cloud services,"" said Yeo Teck Guan, chief business technology officer, Singapore Pools.""The upcoming second Oracle cloud region in Singapore is timely for Siam Makro as we are expanding across the South East Asia region. We'll soon be able to scale up on our cloud-based technology as well as consolidate our cloud needs holistically, allowing us to operate more efficiently,"" said Paul Stephen Howe, group chief information technology officer, Siam Makro.""We're thrilled to embark on this journey with Oracle as its second cloud region will offer endless possibilities for system integrators and independent software vendors like us to scale our operations and achieve greater performance. With Oracle's advanced technologies and our expertise in delivering mission-critical IT services, we are poised to help our customers and advisors navigate the complexities of the digital landscape and optimize their digital journey,"" said Richard James, managing director, enterprise application services, APMEA, DXC Technology.Oracle Cloud's Rapidly Growing Global FootprintOracle provides a broad and consistent set of cloud services, with the same low prices, across more than 41 cloud regions in 22 countries.

The new Oracle Database 23c Free—Developer Release meets growing demand from developers and organizations worldwide to access the newest features in Oracle Database 23c ""App Simple"". Developers now have access to innovative Oracle Database features that simplify development of modern data-driven applications, getting them ready for the planned release of Oracle Database 23c, the next Long-Term Support Release.(PRNewsfoto/Oracle)""Oracle is delighted to provide developers early access to the world's most advanced database technologies for developing and running modern applications,"" said Juan Loaiza, executive vice president, mission-critical database technologies, Oracle. ""With Oracle Database 23c Free­–Developer Release, developers will be able to level up their skills and start building new apps using breakthrough features such as the JSON Relational Duality which unifies the Relational and Document data models providing the best of both worlds, SQL support for Graph queries directly on OLTP data, and Stored Procedures in the world's most popular programming language - JavaScript.""Putting developers first, Oracle Database 23c Free—Developer ReleaseOracle Database 23c Free—Developer Release is available for download as a Docker Image, VirtualBox VM, or Linux RPM installation file, without requiring a user account or login. A Windows version is planned to follow shortly.""Developers are the most important constituency in tech decision making today. Therefore, getting tools into their hands with a minimum of friction is more important than ever,"" said James Governor, co-founder of RedMonk. ""Oracle Database 23c Free­–Developer Release is designed to remove obstacles to developer access, allowing devs to define the ecosystem without requiring permission. This is a radical departure for Oracle.""Story continuesOracle Database 23c Free–Developer Release includes:JSON Relational Duality: Developers can build applications in either relational or JSON paradigms with a single source of truth and benefit from the strengths of both—relational and document models. Data is held once, but can be accessed, written, and modified with either approach. Developers benefit from the best of both JSON and relational models, including ACID compliant transactions and concurrency controls, which means they no longer have to make tradeoffs between complex object-relational mappings or data inconsistency issues.JavaScript Stored Procedures (powered by GraalVM): JavaScript code can now be executed closer to data than ever before by writing JavaScript Stored Procedures or loading existing JavaScript libraries into Oracle Database. Support for JavaScript code improves developer productivity by allowing reuse of existing business logic straight inside the data tier and reuse of JavaScript developer skills. JavaScript code invocation can be intermixed with SQL and PL/SQL, providing polyglot programming language support.JSON Schema: Developers can now ensure and validate JSON document structures via industry-standard JSON Schemas, enabling the confident and reliable use of the JSON data format.Operational Property Graphs: Developers can now build both transactional and analytical property graph applications with Oracle Database, using its industry-leading, new SQL standard property graph queries support, including running graph analytics on top of both relational and JSON data.Oracle Kafka APIs: Kafka applications can now run against Oracle Database Transactional Event Queues with minimal code changes. This enables much more robust microservices built using transactional events that perform event operations and database changes in a single atomic transaction.SQL Domains: The new domain construct can act as lightweight type modifiers that centrally document intended data usage, extending and drastically improving SQL standard domains. This allows developers to better understand how data is used and improves overall data quality, without the complexity and incompatibility of usage-specific data types or user-defined types.Annotations: Database metadata can now be stored directly alongside the data with the new annotation mechanism inside the Oracle Database. Developers can annotate common data model attributes for tables, columns, views, indexes, and more—providing a central, lightweight, declarative facility to register and exchange usage properties across applications. Storing the metadata along with the data guarantees consistency and universal accessibility to any user or application that uses the data.""With Oracle Database 23c Free—Developer Release, developers get early access to new app dev features highlighted by JSON Relational Duality,"" said Carl Olofson, research vice president, Data Management Software, IDC. ""This release finally gives developers an opportunity to try out a feature that unifies and synchronizes the documents and relational worlds. It enables developers and data engineers to access formats for each use case without worrying about data structure, data mapping, data consistency or performance tuning. They can now also run graph analytics on top of both relational and JSON data. Oracle's JSON Relational Duality, a truly revolutionary solution, is perhaps one of the most important innovations in information science in 20 years.""Additional ResourcesRead the Oracle Database 23c Free technical blogLearn more about Oracle DatabaseAbout OracleOracle offers integrated suites of applications plus secure, autonomous infrastructure in the Oracle Cloud.

EXR has struck a deal to acquire Life Storage, Inc. LSI in an all-stock transaction. The move will result in the combined company becoming the largest storage operator in the country with more than 3,500 locations, more than 264 million square feet and serving more than two million customers. Life Storage earlier rejected a bid from the industry behemoth Public Storage PSA.The move seems a strategic fit as within the first year of closing, the transaction is expected to be accretive to core funds from operations (FFO) per share and is also expected to be leverage neutral. The transaction is currently expected to close in the second half of 2023 and is subject to Extra Space and Life Storage shareholders’ nod and the satisfaction of other customary closing norms.Shares of Life Storage were up 3.54% during Monday’s regular trading session, while shares of Extra Space were down 5.17%.Per the agreement terms, shareholders of Life Storage will get 0.8950 of an Extra Space share for each share they own. Based on Extra Space's share price close on Mar 31, 2023, this represents a total consideration of roughly $145.82 per share. Public Storage earlier offered $129 per share for Life Storage, which was rejected by the latter, noting that the offer “significantly” undervalued the business.The combined company is expected to have a pro forma equity market capitalization of around $36 billion and a total enterprise value of roughly $47 billion. When the transaction closes, shareholders of EXR are expected to own around 65% of the combined company, while shareholders of LSI are to own the rest 35%. Also, there will be an expansion of Extra Space’s board from 10 to 12 directors, comprising nine directors from Extra Space's board and three directors from Life Storage.The transaction will increase the size of Extra Space's portfolio by more than 50% by store count. Particularly, it will add Life Storage's 1,198 properties — including 758 wholly owned, 141 joint ventures and 299 third-party managed stores — thereby adding more than 88 million square feet to the portfolio.In addition to offering a “transformative scale” and enhanced diversification, the transaction is expected to generate at least $100 million in annual run-rate operating synergies from general and administrative and property operating expense savings, together with improved property operating revenues and tenant insurance income.Based in Salt Lake City, Utah, Extra Space is a notable name in the self-storage industry and offers a vast array of well-located storage units to its customers, including boat storage, recreational vehicle storage and business storage. EXR is currently the second-largest owner and/or operator of self-storage properties and is the largest self-storage management company in the United States.Here’s how the shares of Public Storage, Extra Space and Life Storage have performed over the past three months against the industry’s decline of 1.4%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCurrently, PSA, EXR and LSI have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this chipmaker have returned +4.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2% change. The Zacks Semiconductor Memory industry, to which Micron belongs, has gained 5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Micron is expected to post a loss of $1.49 per share, indicating a change of -157.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -81.5% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of -$4.42 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -152.9%. This estimate has changed -82% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $0.16 indicates a change of +103.6% from what Micron is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -79.3%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Micron is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MU _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Micron, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $3.7 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -57.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $15.49 billion and $21.3 billion estimates indicate -49.6% and +37.5% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMicron reported revenues of $3.69 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -52.6%. EPS of -$1.91 for the same period compares with $2.14 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.74 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.24%. The EPS surprise was -189.39%.Over the last four quarters, Micron surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Micron is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Micron. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

QuoteIn October 2022, the United States imposed an export ban on certain advanced chips that are used in data centers for artificial intelligence, data analytics and computing applications. Over the past few months, the Netherlands and Japan also joined the United States to restrict China from making advanced chips.The tit-for-tat actions could jeopardize Micron’s prospects, which are already facing the brunt of the weak demand for its memory chips. Chip sales in China make up approximately 11% of Micron’s total revenues.Last week, Micron reported weaker-than-expected financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The company reported a non-GAAP loss of $1.91 per share, which was significantly higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 67 cents. The bottom line compared unfavorably with the prior-year quarter’s earnings of $2.14 per share.The quarterly revenues of Micron plunged 53% year over year to $3.69 billion, which missed the consensus mark of $3.76 billion. The rapidly weakening consumer demand and substantial customer inventory adjustments across end markets amid macroeconomic uncertainty were the main reasons behind the dismal quarterly performance.Story continuesThe memory chip maker has offices in Shanghai and Shenzhen and a chip packaging facility in the city of Xian. In early 2022, Micron announced that it would shut down DRAM design operations at its Shanghai facility by the end of the year. The move was seen as a strategic shift from the manufacturing of chips back to the United States amid mounting trade tensions between the United States and China.MU is not the only semiconductor company that has been impacted by the tech war between the world’s two largest economies. On Aug 31, 2022, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA disclosed that the U.S. government informed it on Aug 26 about imposing a new licensing requirement, effective immediately, for its A100, A100X and forthcoming H100 integrated circuit sales in China and Russia. The government also banned NVIDIA from exporting DGX or any other systems that incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.The new licensing requirements will also be implied for any future chip designs developed by NVIDIA that have a threshold greater than or equivalent to A100. Additionally, any systems developed in the future incorporating the aforementioned types and thresholds will also fall under export restrictions.Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Micron carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while NVIDIA has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Shares of MU and NVDA have rallied 20.7% and 90.1%, respectively, year to date (YTD).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Wix.com WIX and Aspen Technology AZPN, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2.

Bitcoin’s market cap stands at $544 billion, accounting for 44.7% of the total crypto market cap.The sluggish performance of ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) also reflects weakness in the crypto space. In the past year, BITO has lost 39.1%.The massive decline in the major indexes of the U.S. equity market, which has been suffering from the Federal Reserve’s aggressive stance to cut down the inflation rate through continued interest rate hikes, remains the prime reason behind the topsy-turvy crypto market.The Fed raised the benchmark interest rate again by 25 basis points to 4.75-5% in the March FOMC meeting.

470,d47e3218-171b-3f9d-a64b-bdd993c5b2c2,HAS,2023-04-05,Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) Has Announced A Dividend Of $0.70,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hasbro-nasdaq-announced-dividend-0-104658020.html,1680691618,STORY,['HAS'],"[The board of Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS) has announced that it will pay a dividend on the 15th of May, with investors receiving $0.70 per share. The dividend yield will be 5.3% based on this payment which is still above the industry average. Check out our latest analysis for Hasbro Hasbro's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. Based on the last payment, the company wasn't making enough to cover what it was paying to shareholders. It will be difficult to sustain this level of payout so we wouldn't be confident about this continuing.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise exponentially over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate that the payout ratio could reach 47%, which is in a comfortable range for us.historic-dividendHasbro Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.44 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $2.80. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 6.9% over that duration. Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.Dividend Growth Potential Is ShakyThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. However, things aren't all that rosy. Hasbro's earnings per share has shrunk at 14% a year over the past five years. Dividend payments are likely to come under some pressure unless EPS can pull out of the nosedive it is in. It's not all bad news though, as the earnings are predicted to rise over the next 12 months - we would just be a bit cautious until this becomes a long term trend.Story continuesHasbro's Dividend Doesn't Look SustainableIn summary, while it's good to see that the dividend hasn't been cut, we are a bit cautious about Hasbro's payments, as there could be some issues with sustaining them into the future. Although they have been consistent in the past, we think the payments are a little high to be sustained. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income.Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. To that end, Hasbro has 4 warning signs (and 2 which are a bit concerning) we think you should know about.

To skip our analysis of the recent market trends, you can go directly to see the 5 Biggest Fast Food Companies in the World.Fast food restaurants typically offer food to their customers on a short notice by using frozen, preheated, or precooked ingredients served in packaging which allows the customers to easily take-away the food. Fast food was launched to cater to the large number of commuters, travelers, and labor force. It benefitted significantly from the massive increase in automotive ownership through its drive-through model which allows customers to purchase food within minutes without getting out of their car.Similar to almost all other industries, the fast food industry, also referred to as the Quick Service Restaurant industry, was also negatively impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. The restaurant industry faced significant decline in restaurant traffic as indoor dining was restricted due to social distancing orders. The fast food industry in the U.S. experienced a nearly 20% decline in restaurant traffic according to a report by Statista.Despite the significant decline in restaurant traffic, the take-out and delivery models allowed the fast food industry to curtail the risk of any significant decline in its revenues. The industry revenue in the U.S. shrunk by 2.8% in 2020 and was recorded at $301.5 billion. Mass vaccination and other measures allowed softening of restrictions in 2021 which allowed the companies to recover lost revenues. The fast food industry generated a revenue of $322 billion in 2021.We have picked the 16 biggest fast food companies in the world based on the number of restaurants and franchise locations operated by them across the world. Some of these companies are standalone brands, either owned privately or with publicly traded shares, while others are a part of a group of restaurant companies owned by a single organization, such as Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM) and Restaurant Brands International Inc.

To access Aon's interactive tracker, which dates to 2013, click here. The tool uses Aon's risk analyzer platform, which allows plan sponsors to track their individual plan's funded status daily. Versions of the pension tracker are also available for the S&amp;P 500 in the U.S. and for other indices in the UK.Key findings as March 31, 2023 include:Pension assets gained 5.1 percent over the first quarter of 2023.The long-term Government of Canada bond yield decreased 26 basis points (bps) during the quarter and credit spreads widened by two bps. This combination resulted in a decrease in the interest rates used to value pension liabilities from 4.84 percent to 4.60 percent. Given that most plans in Canada are still exposed to interest rate risk, the increase in pension liability caused by decreasing interest rates partially offset the positive effect of asset returns on the funded status of the plans.""The recent issues in the banking system had surprisingly little bearing on overall equity return in the first quarter, as equity markets continued their recovery after a strong Q4. This was enough to have a small positive impact on funded ratios and more than offset the small negative effect of a decrease in interest rates,"" said Erwan Pirou, Canada chief investment officer at Aon. ""Many pension plans are looking at ways to protect the current good financial position with de-risking or hibernation strategies as well as pension risk transfer activities.""Story continuesFor more information, please click here.About AonAon plc (NYSE: AON) exists to shape decisions for the better — to protect and enrich the lives of people around the world.

The company temporarily closing its US offices to start the week as it plans to lay off part of its workforce.Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma is here with more on that story, and Brooke, what have you learned about these planned layoffs?BROOKE DIPALMA: Yeah, well, lots of details falling out over the course of today. Layoffs are, in fact, underway at the Golden Arches. Now, we know that this is part of a larger restructuring effort to [? hone ?] [? in ?] effectiveness and streamline operations at the business.Now, following this announcement earlier this year of putting a greater emphasis on restaurant development as part of that growth strategy-- what they're calling Accelerating the Arches 2.0. And so CEO Chris Kempczinski hinted towards these layoffs earlier this year.Now per a source familiar with the matter, offices will, in fact, be closed Monday to Wednesday of this week to provide confidentiality and respect to colleagues that are exiting. In addition to that, we know this will impact corporate office jobs, not restaurant teams. But it is still unclear of how many employees this will impact. As of 2022 year end, there were currently 150,000 employees at McDonald's.In addition to that, we heard from a source familiar with the matter that this will not be of the same magnitude that we're hearing at tech layoffs like Amazon or Meta, but we also know now that McDonald's plans to speak to all of its employees, those impacted by layoffs in addition to others who will be informed of promotions or new roles at the company.DAVE BRIGGS: Interesting. Can't remember another public company taking this move to close for layoffs. How's the Street reacting?BROOKE DIPALMA: Well, shares now up about 1%, but earlier today, shares of McDonald's did, in fact, hit a record intraday high. That high was slightly above where it is now at $282.81. That beats its previous record intraday high previously set on November 10 of last year.Story continuesBut the Street not seeming like this is too much of a surprise here. As I noted earlier, CEO Chris Kempczinski did hint at this in a memo to all of its employees in January. One analyst telling Yahoo Finance earlier today that this is an opportunity to reduce G&amp;A expenses, which McDonald's tends to run heavy on, and allow-- this will allow it to move more quickly. We also saw a similar strategy taken by Wendy's earlier this year.Another analyst saying that layoffs, of course, are painful, but it's good to see that the firm is working to stay ahead of development curve despite posting those really positive results that we saw earlier this year. The latest quarter saw strong double-digit sales growth across the board last quarter, and now we're just gearing up ahead, about a month away. On April 25, McDonald's will post its next quarterly results. So certainly lots to stay tuned to in that next earnings call.SEANA SMITH: Shares up just about 1% today. All right, Brooke DiPalma, great stuff. Thank you.]"

But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.Paccar (PCAR) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this truck maker is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Paccar is 1.6%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 13.8% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 8.8%.Impressive Asset Utilization RatioGrowth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio, also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio, but it is an important feature of a real growth stock. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.Story continuesRight now, Paccar has an S/TA ratio of 0.92, which means that the company gets $0.92 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.29, it can be said that the company is more efficient.While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot, so does the sales growth of a company. And Paccar is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 10% this year versus the industry average of 7.9%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Paccar. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1.9% over the past month.Bottom LinePaccar has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination positions Paccar well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Japan’s auto giant Honda’s HMC also made it to the top stories as it grapples with vehicle recalls.While GPI and PCAR currently carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), WGO and HMC are #3 Ranked (Hold). Meanwhile, F carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Last Week’s Top StoriesWinnebago inked an agreement to acquire Lithionics as it looks to secure supply chain for its electric offerings, going forward. The acquisition of Lithionics will empower Winnebago Industries with enhanced technological and engineering capabilities to offer consumers more innovative products with cutting-edge electrical solutions.The terms of the deal have been kept under wraps. The acquisition is expected to boost WGO’s near-and long-term margins.Winnebago’s CEO Michael Happe said, “The addition of Lithionics enhances Winnebago Industries’ ability to develop unique and diverse battery solutions across our portfolio, advancing our overall electrical ecosystem, driving organic growth and supply chain security, reinforcing our technological competitive advantage and allowing us to capitalize on consumer preferences for fully immersive, off-the-grid outdoor experiences.”Story continuesIn a separate development, Winnebago’s subsidiary, Chris-Craft, is opening a new manufacturing facility in Sarasota. The state-of-the-art manufacturing site spans over 70,000 sq ft and will boost the company’s production capacity by 50%.Group 1 announced the acquisition of Estero Bay Chevrolet dealership in Estero, FL in a bid to further expand its operations in the United States and boost revenues.Located near Fort Myers in Southwest Florida. Estero Bay Chevrolet is the fifth largest Chevrolet dealership in terms new vehicle volume in Florida. The buyout is expected to add $150 million in annualized sales.Group 1’s acquisitions of dealerships and franchises to expand and optimize its portfolio are likely to boost the firm’s prospects. In 2021, the company acquired Prime Automotive in Northeastern United States and the Robinsons Group in the UK, which diversified Group 1’s footprint and are set to buoy top-line growth. In 2022, Group 1 completed transactions representing $1 billion of acquired revenues.Meanwhile, Group 1 also provided an update on its share buyback activity. From the beginning of 2023 to Mar 28, 2023, the company repurchased 180,982 shares for $34.7 million at an average price of $191.85.Honda is recalling over 330,000 vehicles because the heating pads behind both side-view mirrors may not be properly bonded, possibly resulting in the mirror glass coming out and increasing the risk of accidents. The recall covers the 2020-2022 Odyssey, 2020-2022 Passport, 2020-2021 Pilot and 2020-2021 Ridgeline. As stated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the vehicles do not comply with the necessary rear visibility standards. Honda dealers will replace impacted vehicles' side-view mirrors at no cost.This is the second recall issue in March. A couple of weeks back, Honda recalled nearly 500,000 vehicles due to manufacturing issues that could prevent front seat belts from latching properly.The models that are part of the recall are 2017-2020 CR-V, 2018-2020 Odyssey, 2018-2019 Accord and Accord Hybrids, 2019-2020 Acura RDXs and the 2019 Insight.Ford will be investing in the Pomalaa Block High-Pressure Acid Leaching (HPAL) Project in Indonesia. Vale and Huayou commenced construction of the plant last November and commercial operations at the facility are expected to begin in 2026. The three-way nickel project aims to produce up to 120 kilotons per year of contained nickel in the form of ""mixed hydroxide precipitate,"" which is a lower-cost nickel product used in EV batteries. The partnership supports Ford’s ambitious targets to deliver 2 million EVs by the end of 2026.Quoting Lisa Drake, vice president of Ford Model e EV industrialization, “This framework gives Ford direct control to source the nickel we need – in one of the industry’s lowest-cost ways – and allows us to ensure the nickel is mined in line with our company’s sustainability targets, setting the right ESG standards as we scale. Working this way puts Ford in a position to help make EVs more accessible for millions and to do it in a way that helps better protect people and the planet.”Meanwhile, in a bid to offset commodity inflation pressures, Ford hiked the prices of its hot-selling F-150 Lightning e-pickup. The company is raising the price of F-150 Lightning Pro from $55,974 to $59,974.PACCAR and Platform Science recently partnered to integrate Platform Science’s Virtual Vehicle technology with the PACCAR Connect telematics system. This strategic investment will supplement the integration process. The investment in Platform Science will make PACCAR Connect a handy, customizable and productive connected truck solution and improve customers’ agility and operating efficiency.

(NASDAQ:TROW) is heavily dominated by institutional owners",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/78-ownership-shares-t-rowe-110703218.html,1680692823,STORY,['TROW'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies T. Rowe Price Group's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions50% of the business is held by the top 18 shareholdersOwnership research along with  analyst forecasts data  help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stockIf you want to know who really controls T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TROW), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 78% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of T. Rowe Price Group. See our latest analysis for T. Rowe Price Group ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About T. Rowe Price Group?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that T. Rowe Price Group does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of T. Rowe Price Group, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. T. Rowe Price Group is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 12% of shares outstanding. With 8.2% and 6.6% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 18 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of T. Rowe Price GroupWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.We can see that insiders own shares in T. Rowe Price Group, Inc.. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$540m. Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.

Shaw pushed for change and won two additional board seats.The deflating e-commerce delivery bubble and specter of potential recession over the past year has intensified pressure on Chief Executive Officer Raj Subramaniam to streamline operations.""We believe now is the right time to reorganize how we work together,"" Subramaniam told a company meeting in New York City.""We will be leaner, more agile and better positioned to execute on our mission to help customers compete and win with the world's smartest logistics network.""The combined business is expected to handle all deliveries from June 2024 as part of the wider plan by the Memphis-based group to cut $4 billion in permanent costs by the end of its 2025 financial year.John Smith will become president and CEO of U.S. and Canada ground operations at FedEx Express and assume leadership of surface operations across the FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight businesses from April 16.FedEx Freight will continue to provide freight transportation services as a standalone company under the Federal Express Corp banner, the company added.Shares in FedEx, which also announced a 10% dividend boost on Wednesday, were about 1% at $228.69.'HYBRID' MODELThe new structure would end roughly two decades of separate delivery operations and create an entity similar to cost-conscious rival UPS, which has outperformed FedEx despite having a more expensive union labor force.Story continuesThe company is testing the new combined service in Minneapolis, executives said. FedEx Express is already handling FedEx Ground's pickups and deliveries in Alaska and Hawaii where air service dominates.Recent company changes have fueled concern among Ground contractors worried about their ongoing role at the company. Subramaniam said FedEx will use a ""hybrid"" employee and contractor model for deliveries. The CEO added that the company will remain non-union.Executives said FedEx has been ""looking"" at this project for the last couple years, but analysts noted that the company's ""standstill"" agreement with activist D.E. Shaw was set to expire at the end of May. That agreement put activities to influence company control or governance on hold.Regardless of the reason for the timing, the company now has about a year to bring about massive change.Satish Jindel, who helped found the company that eventually became FedEx Ground, attended Wednesday's meeting and now leads consultancy ShipMatrix. He told Reuters it was an achievable goal that should boost profit and shares.Critics noted that FedEx executives had a years-long struggle with its TNT integration in Europe and let overhead expenses swamp its labor cost advantage over UPS.""There's no way that this isn't fraught with risk,"" said Dean Maciuba, managing partner at Crossroads Parcel Consulting and former FedEx sales executive. But, he said, ""if they do it right, they can evolve as a lower-cost service provider than UPS.""

Among other things, FedEx has parked Express planes, retired older MD-11 aircraft and laid off 10% of officers and directors to reduce costs.The company, which competes with direct rival United Parcel Service and Amazon.com's growing delivery operation, is racing to reduce overhead that has pressured profits as demand for deliveries cools and global recession threatens.Even with better-than-expected progress on cost controls during the quarter that ended Feb. 28, Express operating margin for that period fell to 1.2% from 4.6% the year earlier.""The volume and broader economic outlook remain uncertain, and timing for delivery of the remainder of the company's cost savings initiatives is still a bit fuzzy,"" Stifel analyst Bruce Chan said in a client note last month.

It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years.

The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), a global entertainment company, experienced operating losses in its streaming services last year, resulting in a 27.75% drop in shares. With the return of former CEO Bob Iger, cost-saving measures have been implemented, and the company plans to improve the guest experience in its parks, experiences, and products unit. Focusing on core brands and franchises like Star Wars, Avatar and the Marvel Cinematic Universe has driven engagement and sales. Despite pandemic effects, Disney's restructuring and cost-saving program are expected to make it more efficient and profitable in the future. Disney stock has risen 3.09% in the past six months, making it a good long-term investment.The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is a ‘Strong Buy’ with 17 buy ratings and an average price target of $128.41, representing a 28.24% increase from the current price of $100.13. The highest price target is $141.00, and the lowest is $110.00.According to Insider Monkey’s data, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) was part of 99 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q4 2022, compared to 112 in the Q3 2022. Trian Partners is the biggest stakeholder of The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), with 9.03 million shares worth $784.51 million.Meridian Funds made the following comment about The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Global entertainment giant The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) lagged the market as results in its theme park business missed expectations, due in part to recession-wary consumers and the continued pandemic-related shutdown of its resort in Shanghai. In addition, investor uncertainty around the long-term profitability of its streaming business continued, although Disney rolled out price increases and an advertising-supported tier of its Disney+ subscription service during the quarter. The company also changed its leadership, bringing former CEO Bob Iger back to the top job. While disappointed with the stock’s recent performance, we intend to stay patient as the company’s broad reservoir of iconic brands and related franchises provide multiple avenues for long-term value creation. In our view, the broader market continues to underestimate Disney’s franchise value and its earnings power.”6. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (NYSE:JPM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 100JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (NYSE:JPM) benefits from consolidation in the U.S. banking sector as it scoops up customers leaving Silicon Valley Bank and other small banks. The company's stock is a good value, with a P/E ratio of 9.78x. It also pays an annual dividend yield of 3.07%. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (NYSE:JPM) is likely to emerge as one of the strongest banking plays on the market, and its position as the largest bank in the U.S. was highlighted when it deposited billions into First Republic Bank (NYSE:FRC).JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (NYSE:JPM) is currently rated as a ‘Moderate Buy’ by analysts, with 11 buy ratings and 4 hold ratings. The average price target for the stock is $153.73, with a high target of $189.00 and a low of $120.00. This suggests a potential increase of 17.97% from the current price of $130.31.Hedge fund interest in JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (NYSE:JPM) has lately decreased.

Greenhaven Associates, with 4.80 million shares, is the biggest stakeholder in the company.Along with Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Merck &amp; Co Inc. (NYSE:MRK), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (NYSE:JPM) is one of the Dow stocks on the radar of the investors.In its Q3 2022 investor letter, Vltava Fund stated the following about JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM):“We regard JPM to be the strongest and best- managed bank in the world. It is a leader in investment banking, commercial banking, credit cards, and asset management. Its size (the largest bank in the USA, with nearly USD 4,000 billion in assets) and diversification give it a strong competitive advantage that is compounded by its cost advantages and the high costs to clients associated with switching banks. JPM’s management prides itself on running the only large bank to avoid major instability over the long term.JP Morgan’s quality and strength first became fully evident in 2008 under the leadership of its CEO Jamie Dimon. Not only did JP Morgan help to stabilize the market by taking over the failing Bear Stearns in the spring of that year, but throughout the Great Financial Crisis it was the only big U.S. bank that did not require government assistance and it was highly profitable even in the difficult year of 2008.A well-functioning and efficient bank can be a very good long-term investment, because the interest compounding effect works well here. JPM’s return on equity (ROE) is well into the double digits and this puts it in a good position to continue producing better long-term returns than does the market. JPM has been very profitable even during years when interest rates were close to zero. The current – and perhaps not temporary – return to somewhat more normal, higher interest rates should have a significantly positive impact on the bank’s interest income and overall profitability.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Dow Stocks To Buy Right Now. Suggested articles:11 Best Dow Jones Dividend Stocks According to Hedge Funds15 Cheap Beginner Stocks to BuyStarter Stock Portfolio: 15 Safe Stocks To BuyDisclosure: None. 12 Best Dow Stocks To Buy Right Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.American Express and Moody's are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that AXP is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.AXP currently has a forward P/E ratio of 14.66, while MCO has a forward P/E of 32.84. We also note that AXP has a PEG ratio of 1.01. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. MCO currently has a PEG ratio of 2.99.Another notable valuation metric for AXP is its P/B ratio of 4.99. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, MCO has a P/B of 20.85.Story continuesThese metrics, and several others, help AXP earn a Value grade of B, while MCO has been given a Value grade of F.AXP is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model.

501,4754b3ca-b007-3a9b-9a28-bbb6d497a948,NI,2023-04-05,NiSource (NYSE:NI) Has Announced That It Will Be Increasing Its Dividend To $0.25,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nisource-nyse-ni-announced-increasing-101205871.html,1680689525,STORY,"['NI', 'NIMC']","[NiSource Inc.'s (NYSE:NI) dividend will be increasing from last year's payment of the same period to $0.25 on 19th of May. Based on this payment, the dividend yield for the company will be 3.6%, which is fairly typical for the industry. See our latest analysis for NiSource NiSource's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWhile it is always good to see a solid dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is feasible. Based on the last payment, NiSource's earnings were much higher than the dividend, but it wasn't converting those earnings into cash flow. Since a dividend means the company is paying out cash to investors, this could prove to be a problem in the future.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to fall by 1.1%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we believe the payout ratio could be 57%, which we are pretty comfortable with and we think is feasible on an earnings basis.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityThe company's dividend history has been marked by instability, with at least one cut in the last 10 years. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.96 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $1.00. Dividend payments have been growing, but very slowly over the period. Modest growth in the dividend is good to see, but we think this is offset by historical cuts to the payments. It is hard to live on a dividend income if the company's earnings are not consistent.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowGiven that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. We are encouraged to see that NiSource has grown earnings per share at 36% per year over the past five years. The company doesn't have any problems growing, despite returning a lot of capital to shareholders, which is a very nice combination for a dividend stock to have.Our Thoughts On NiSource's DividendOverall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think NiSource will make a great income stock. With cash flows lacking, it is difficult to see how the company can sustain a dividend payment. We don't think NiSource is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. To that end, NiSource has 3 warning signs (and 1 which doesn't sit too well with us) we think you should know about. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

The jump came on an impressive volume with a higher-than-average number of shares changing hands in the session. This compares to the stock's 12.3% loss over the past four weeks.Schlumberger’s shares rallied on the last trading day. The bullishness could be attributed to the sustained high oil and gas prices which is encouraging customers to increase drilling activities. This has increased demand for the company’s oilfield services. With the strong demand for its services, Schlumberger is well positioned to generate record-breaking free cash flows this year.This world's largest oilfield services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.69 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +102.9%. Revenues are expected to be $7.55 billion, up 26.6% from the year-ago quarter.Earnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.For Schlumberger, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. And a stock's price usually doesn't keep moving higher in the absence of any trend in earnings estimate revisions. So, make sure to keep an eye on SLB going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road.The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

But across the board there are plenty of stocks that underperform the market. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the PPL Corporation (NYSE:PPL) share price is up 15% in the last three years, that falls short of the market return. Disappointingly, the share price is down 3.9% in the last year.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. Check out our latest analysis for PPL While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over the last three years, PPL failed to grow earnings per share, which fell 1.4% (annualized).While EPS is down but the share price is moving up, neither move is particularly drastic, suggesting the market was previously too pessimistic. Still, if EPS declines indefinitely, the share price will likely follow (especially if the company makes a loss).You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that PPL has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, PPL's TSR for the last 3 years was 33%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAlthough it hurts that PPL returned a loss of 0.7% in the last twelve months, the broader market was actually worse, returning a loss of 11%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 5%, each year, over five years. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand PPL better, we need to consider many other factors.

Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Pentair's  ROE today.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Pentair How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Pentair is:18% = US$483m ÷ US$2.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.18 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Pentair's Earnings Growth And 18% ROETo begin with, Pentair seems to have a respectable ROE. Further, the company's ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 13%. Probably as a result of this, Pentair was able to see a decent growth of 20% over the last five years.As a next step, we compared Pentair's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 7.5%.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is PNR fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Story continuesIs Pentair Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?With a three-year median payout ratio of 29% (implying that the company retains 71% of its profits), it seems that Pentair is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees respectable amount growth in its earnings and pays a dividend that's well covered.Additionally, Pentair has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 23% of its profits over the next three years. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 21%.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with Pentair's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Tractor Supply Crunching The NumbersWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$828.5mUS$1.06bUS$1.19bUS$1.28bUS$1.34bUS$1.40bUS$1.44bUS$1.49bUS$1.53bUS$1.56bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x10Analyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 3.93%Est @ 3.37%Est @ 2.98%Est @ 2.71%Est @ 2.52% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.3% US$765US$900US$936US$926US$900US$863US$823US$783US$742US$702(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$8.3bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.6b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.3%– 2.1%) = US$25bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$25b÷ ( 1 + 8.3%)10= US$11bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$20b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$235, the company appears reasonably expensive at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Tractor Supply as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.056. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Tractor SupplyStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year is below its 5-year average.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Specialty Retail market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a premium to intrinsic value?

But we do have a backdrop now of a banking crisis that just started weeks ago. The surprise going forward in the next few quarters could be that the economy drops off more than anticipated.WEI LI: It is our belief that focus would shift to fundamentals, shift to earnings. And on that front, we're already seeing signs of margins compression, earnings contracting for the first time since late 2020.Story continuesANN BERRY: I'm incredibly, incredibly boring. I think cash is queen. But I do think it'll change at some point. So I'm looking out for Q2 earnings. I think they're going to be weaker than expected.MICHAEL DARDA: At the end of the day, if the earnings are not there, then we could have more problems for the equity market in front of us.- There's been, certainly, no shortage of surprises in the markets really over the last couple of years, but even just the last several weeks.LEE MUNSON: Here's what I think that are the biggest risks that I'm concerned about. The Fed's going to keep raising rates a little bit, maybe a couple more times. I think reality is going to set in that the earnings revisions aren't enough. But the real thing that I think is going to be a problem is if we see a reversal of inflation coming down.]"

(NASDAQ:AMD) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“The share price of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) was weak during the quarter and weakened further in early October when the pre-announced revenue was significantly below prior guidance, reflecting an acute slowdown in the PC market. Data centre related revenue grew strongly, albeit below our expectations, while gaming and embedded revenue was in line with our base case.Geopolitical risks have increased for the semiconductor sector, with the U.S. Government announcing restrictions on the sale of certain technologies to China. Despite near term headwinds, AMD is well positioned for the medium term, with a technology lead over Intel in servers for data centres and rapidly gaining share in the PC/notebook sectors. Its gaming and embedded applications continue to grow strongly. AMD is a very capital light business, with manufacturing outsourced. After expending nearly $5b on research and development, AMD generates around $5b of free cashflow. With a net cash balance sheet, we expect management will accelerate buyback activity at a share price well below fair value.The share price of our more cyclical businesses, in particularly the building products companies which have exposure to the U.S. residential, repair and renovation and infrastructure sectors, were broadly flat for the quarter. Rapidly escalating mortgage rates and rapidly reducing affordability will have a pronounced negative effect on near term new residential construction activity. We believe these cyclical pressures are well understood and are more than reflected in current share prices. Overall, we strongly believe share prices are overly reflecting near-term challenges and our portfolio of companies are now meaningfully undervalued.”6.

We are directing our research efforts to identifying names that are closer to the bottom than the top in terms of earnings and valuations, adding to our positions in ASML, the leading supplier of high-end production equipment to chip makers, and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), whose valuation has washed out due to weakness in gaming and crypto mining as well as slowing enterprise spending.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best WallStreetBets Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested articles:12 Cheap Penny Stocks to Buy According to Hedge FundsStarter Stock Portfolio: 15 Safe Stocks To Buy12 Best Low-Priced Technology Stocks To Invest InDisclosure: None. 12 Best WallStreetBets Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

So what was the instigator here, and is $100 a barrel oil on the horizon? Let's discuss this with Blue Line Futures President Bill Baruch and Neal Dingmann, Truist managing director energy research. Good to see you both.Bill, we'll start with you. How much did--NEAL DINGMANN: Thank you.DAVE BRIGGS: --geopolitics play in here, and how much is strictly the price action we've seen in recent weeks and months?BILL BARUCH: You know, I think there's quite a bit going on behind the scenes here. You know, White House didn't fill the SPR where they had a little bit of an opportunity to. Same time, there's a lot in the news right now with China making deals with Saudi Arabia, making deals with Brazil, trying to go around the dollar potentially. You know, there's definitely some just interesting narratives to keep in mind here.For me, what I'm seeing is, you know, we got somewhat negative at the end of last year on oil, its difficulties of trying to get above $82, $83 on a technical basis. Losing the speculators in the market. You saw open interest just continue to erode into the end of last year.And we finally got the flush out. Really a cleansing last week was the bottoming process that really began into last week. A 5% move last week on Monday. Another more than 5% move today. We haven't had a 5% move in oil going back to November, and prior to that was May.So these are big moves here, and I think that cleansing allows, you know, the speculators to start maybe coming back. A little bit reaffirmation now with this move. But we've got to get above $82 to $83. It's been a really big ceiling there. So until that happens, this is just a nice, you know, big, little bounce up, rebound.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: Well, here we are today just above $80, just below $81 a barrel here. Neal, how has this or has this at all changed your price forecast, either for year end or even out into 2024?NEAL DINGMANN: I think it does put a floor on prices. And, you know, I come at it a little bit different angle. I think about, you know, my producers. I cover almost 40-odd names, and what's interesting, I think at one time the US producers were-- I would call them the swing factor when it came to supply out there. And what we've seen is prices were over $90-ish not terribly long ago. Then they recently were down to $60. What I noticed from almost all of my public companies, they're not changing their plans.So I think what the US administration realizes now, as much as they might want it, the US is not going to be that supply-- swing supplier. Unfortunately, now that looks like it is in the hands of OPEC Plus, most specifically Russia and Saudi. And they stepped in and made a big call where, you know, five years ago plus, the US companies probably would have stepped in and made the call themselves. And that, to me, is just no longer going to happen.DAVE BRIGGS: Bill, you referenced the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. What position does this put the White House in in terms of filling that at some point in the near future?BILL BARUCH: You know, I think they're going to be stick the narrative they said about a week-- about a month ago-- I'm sorry-- that they're going to look, you know, in the future. I think they're probably looking out to later this year, potentially, if they get another opportunity.But I do agree, you know, with the gentleman here that he's saying that there's a floor in the market now. And I think looking at it from a technical basis, $75 area was the close on Friday. That's going to be basically that gap. I mean, if it does start selling off, there's an air pocket there.I also agree that you're not seeing production coming back online from the US. They're going to struggle to get above 13 million barrels here in the US. And then on top of that, it's expensive due to, you know, these oil-services companies have raised the cost. You know, just logistically, it's hard to justify bringing it online. And then, you know, these energy companies have become, you know, lauded by investors here with the dividends. So sort of affirming the dividends, and I think that they're looking at it from a different game here now.And these companies, you know, we're very overweight energy. We added Pioneer early last week and bring us up to about 15% weighting in energy right now. And my fear really was some of these E&amp;P companies tethered to that price of oil. If oil wasn't going to rebound, they could sort of languish a little bit lower.But this does get me excited. I still want to see more from the market in the underlying crude oil, but I am excited for this to be a reinvigoration of a bull move.SEANA SMITH: Neal, you mentioned several producer companies that you do cover. Of those, who's best positioned here to benefit from today's news?NEAL DINGMANN: I think, you know, a name that comes to mind right away is Occidental Petroleum. You look at OXY, and the knock was they still had a bit too much leverage. But again, in a market like this where, as Bill said, you probably have a new floor, you know, people don't worry about that. You have Buffett coming in and Berkshire buying a lot of that stock. So OXY seems to be sitting very, very nice.Another one you look today is doing very well is Marathon, MRO. Again, Bill was talking about it. You talk about shareholder return. Marathon bought back almost-- over 15% of their stock last year, and we think they'll buy back almost the same. So you look at it in a two-year period buying back almost a third of your shares, that's hard to beat.And then maybe the last one that we would say is Diamondback Energy. We think they are-- you know, Bill hit a key point, and that was service costs aren't going down. But if you look at FANG, they are by far the lowest operator. We have them at a break even of less than-- right around $30, which is much less than anybody else.So, you know, a time of big-- of higher prices, you don't worry as much about cost. But their margins just hit right to the bottom line, and they're just a fantastic producer.DAVE BRIGGS: Bill, do you have any names? And we talked about a floor there. What about the ceiling by the end of summer? Is $100, $95 as Goldman Sachs suggested, possible?BILL BARUCH: Yeah, I think $100 could be a little bit of a magnet, but I'm not going out on a limb just yet. I've got to see a weekly close above $82, $83. You know, like I said, we are-- You mentioned names. We're 15% weighted energy right now with Chevron, Marathon Petroleum. I mean, we really do like the refiners. You're not seeing Marathon Petroleum benefit so much here today, but, you know, seasonally, gasoline hits a very bullish time at the end of March really into Memorial weekend, and some of these, the refining margins can be a tailwind to some of those. We like Marathon Petroleum.Schlumberger we own as well. We added-- we've had Pioneer for a while. We cut at the end of last year. Just kind of worried about a wash out in the market. We finally got that wash out, and that's why we added Pioneer back.But, you know, from another standpoint, we saw in the futures contract there was a massive short position that was actually-- you know, last week's move was really a lot of short covering early on, confirmed through the Commitment of Traders. So I think, you know, this move here is welcoming fresh buying because the move up from, you know, below $70 to about $75 was majority of short covering. So I think this is inviting the speculation back, and the open interest, as I mentioned early on, was very low.So I think we can get above $82, $83. It's not going to happen overnight. But if we get above there, I think this could really start-- it invites a buying, fresh buying into the market.SEANA SMITH: Bill, what do you think it means for gas prices? Because we're getting into pretty soon, sooner than we know it, getting into the heavy summer driving season. Are we going to see gas prices back above $4 a gallon?BILL BARUCH: You know, I'm not jumping on that limb quite yet, but I think-- I would imagine so. I mean, usually these things run up into June, and they stay sticky through the summer. So, I mean, from the makings of what we're looking at right now, I imagine we're going to see these bump up here for the next couple months.SEANA SMITH: All right, Bill Baruch, Neal Dingmann, always great to have you. Thanks so much.]"

But don't let that distract from the very nice return generated over three years. In fact, the company's share price bested the return of its market index in that time, posting a gain of 95%.The past week has proven to be lucrative for Capital One Financial investors, so let's see if fundamentals drove the company's three-year performance. Check out our latest analysis for Capital One Financial While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During three years of share price growth, Capital One Financial achieved compound earnings per share growth of 19% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 25% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that, as the business progressed over the last few years, it gained the confidence of market participants. That's not necessarily surprising considering the three-year track record of earnings growth.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Capital One Financial, it has a TSR of 105% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 11% in the twelve months, Capital One Financial shareholders did even worse, losing 25% (even including dividends). Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 2%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 4 warning signs  with Capital One Financial (at least 1 which is a bit unpleasant)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

But in contrast you can make much more than 100% if the company does well. For instance the Ulta Beauty, Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTA) share price is 191% higher than it was three years ago. Most would be happy with that. It's also good to see the share price up 13% over the last quarter. But this could be related to the strong market, which is up 6.2% in the last three months.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. See our latest analysis for Ulta Beauty To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During three years of share price growth, Ulta Beauty achieved compound earnings per share growth of 27% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 43% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did three years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the three-year track record of earnings growth.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Ulta Beauty has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Ulta Beauty will grow revenue in the future.A Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Ulta Beauty shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 37% over the last year. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 20% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity.

So let's get to that first finding, and that is Ulta. It's the top performer as teens just keep buying makeup. They're spending more on it right now. Cosmetics accounted for the majority of money spent on beauty, ranking number one for the first time in about three years.Now, Ulta is the preferred beauty destination among these teens, 41% share. We've covered the success of Ulta's loyalty program in the past. Remember, it has more than 40 million members worldwide.To no surprise, this survey found that Ulta also held the strongest beauty loyalty membership among teens at 63% of those who are members here at Ulta. And, Allie, Ulta has certainly been an outperformer as of late, up almost 20% since the start of the year and certainly one of those names that you would think maybe would be in for a little bit of a rough ride when we talk about the slowing economy, but that certainly does not seem to be taking place.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, outperformer on the stock market. Also an outperformer in this survey. Just consistently the highest rated among teens.I thought it was interesting to see cosmetics overtake skin care in terms of that priority spend for teens, the first time since spring of 2020. And I think you can credit the TikTok boom, the get ready with me videos. A lot of those videos tagging different brands, different makeup products.The survey also indicated that there are more everyday makeup wearers. And of those everyday makeup wearers, they spend around $185 annually on makeup. I wish I spent that little. I think I probably spend a grand a year, and that's being very conservative.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: I also wish I was spending more on makeup rather than skincare.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Skincare too can get very, very, very pricey. But it's a very competitive industry. It is very expensive. So it's interesting to see Ulta take the top point there because for me, I go to Sephora a lot of the time. Maybe that's just more accessible to where I am in New York City.DAVE BRIGGS: Which wasn't far behind in second place.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Right.DAVE BRIGGS: But 41% overwhelmingly the top, and then you could add in there Target, which is third in this, to give them about 48%-- almost 50% of the market share. It's just another beneficiary of that spending shift from goods to experiences and services. People are going out. They're doing things. They want to look good.And they just continue to crush it. Up 17% year to date, 37% over the last 12 months. And it appears completely recession proof no matter what lies around the next corner.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Ulta doing well in this teen survey.]"
527,4b656f30-7fd1-31e7-9e29-c5e5bb2d5d56,ULTA,2023-04-05,Ulta Beauty Inc. (ULTA) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ulta-beauty-inc-ulta-attracting-130001443.html,1680613201,STORY,['ULTA'],"[Ulta Beauty (ULTA) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this beauty products retailer have returned +5.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Miscellaneous industry, which Ulta falls in, has gained 4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Ulta is expected to post earnings of $6.75 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +4.4%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $25.21 points to a change of +5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +3.8%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $27.22 indicates a change of +8% from what Ulta is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.7%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool — the Zacks Rank — is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Ulta.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for ULTA _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Ulta, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2.61 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +11.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $11.07 billion and $11.66 billion estimates indicate +8.5% and +5.3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUlta reported revenues of $3.23 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +18.2%. EPS of $6.68 for the same period compares with $5.41 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.04 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.22%. The EPS surprise was +17.4%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Ulta is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Ulta. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Our proprietary system currently recommends Ulta Beauty (ULTA) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this beauty products retailer a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Ulta is 19.6%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 5% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 2.5%.Cash Flow GrowthWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Ulta is 18.3%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -8.7%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 14.4% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 8%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Ulta. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 3.8% over the past month.Bottom LineUlta has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that Ulta is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The BLAs include requests for Priority Review, which if granted, would shorten the FDA’s review of the application to eight months from the time of submission versus a standard review timeline of 12 months.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230402005036/en/These submissions are supported by results from the ongoing Phase 3 studies, CLIMB-111 and CLIMB-121, as well as an ongoing long-term follow-up study, CLIMB-131. Data from the Phase 3 studies were most recently presented at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition in December of 2022.""The completion of our exa-cel global regulatory filings is a historic milestone,"" said Carmen Bozic, M.D., Executive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs, and Chief Medical Officer at Vertex Pharmaceuticals. ""We want to thank the clinical trial participants and the sickle cell and beta thalassemia communities, as well as the physicians, nurses, coordinators, caregivers and friends who support them.""""Within a decade, we have progressed from the discovery of the CRISPR platform to the first regulatory filings for a CRISPR-based therapy, which speaks to the transformative nature of CRISPR technology,"" said Phuong Khanh (P.K.) Morrow, M.D., FACP, Chief Medical Officer at CRISPR Therapeutics.Story continuesIn the U.S., exa-cel has been granted Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT), Fast Track, Orphan Drug, and Rare Pediatric Disease designations from the FDA for both SCD and TDT.In Europe, the Marketing Authorization Applications (MAAs) for exa-cel were submitted in December 2022 and validated by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in January 2023. In the EU, exa-cel has been granted Orphan Drug Designation from the European Commission, as well as Priority Medicines (PRIME) designation from the EMA, for both SCD and TDT. In the U.K., exa-cel has also been granted an Innovation Passport under the Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway (ILAP) from the MHRA.About exagamglogene autotemcel (exa-cel)Exa-cel, formerly known as CTX001™, is an investigational, autologous, ex vivo CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited therapy that is being evaluated for patients with SCD or TDT, in which a patient’s own hematopoietic stem cells are edited to produce high levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF; hemoglobin F) in red blood cells. HbF is the form of the oxygen-carrying hemoglobin that is naturally present during fetal development, which then switches to the adult form of hemoglobin after birth. The elevation of HbF by exa-cel has the potential to reduce or eliminate painful and debilitating vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) for patients with SCD and reduce or eliminate transfusion requirements for patients with TDT. Earlier results from these ongoing trials were published in The New England Journal of Medicine in January of 2021 and presented at the ASH Annual Meeting and Exposition in December 2022.About CLIMB-111 and CLIMB-121The ongoing Phase 1/2/3 open-label trials, CLIMB-111 and CLIMB-121, are designed to assess the safety and efficacy of a single dose of exa-cel in patients ages 12 to 35 years with TDT or with SCD, characterized by recurrent VOCs, respectively. The trials are now closed for enrollment. Patients will be followed for approximately two years after exa-cel infusion. Each patient will be asked to participate in CLIMB-131, a long-term follow-up trial.About CLIMB-131The ongoing long-term, open-label trial, CLIMB-131, is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of exa-cel in patients who received exa-cel in CLIMB-111, CLIMB-121, CLIMB-141, CLIMB-151 or CLIMB-161. The trial is designed to follow patients for up to 15 years after exa-cel infusion.About CLIMB-141 and CLIMB-151The ongoing Phase 3 open-label trials, CLIMB-141 and CLIMB-151, are designed to assess the safety and efficacy of a single dose of exa-cel in patients ages 2 to 11 years with TDT or with SCD, characterized by recurrent VOCs, respectively. The trials are currently enrolling patients ages 5 to 11 years with a plan to extend to ages 2 to less than 5 years at a later date. Each trial will enroll approximately 12 patients. Patients will be followed for approximately two years after infusion. Each patient will be asked to participate in CLIMB-131, a long-term follow-up trial.About CLIMB-161The ongoing Phase 3b study, CLIMB-161, is to support expansion of our manufacturing footprint after initial potential approval and launch. This study will enroll approximately 12 patients with either SCD or TDT ages 12 to 35 years. Patients will be followed for approximately one year after infusion. Each patient will be asked to participate in CLIMB-131, a long-term follow-up trial.About the Gene-Editing Process in These TrialsPatients who enroll in these trials will have their own hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells collected from peripheral blood. The patient’s cells will be edited using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The edited cells, exa-cel, will then be infused back into the patient as part of an autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), a process which involves a patient being treated with myeloablative busulfan conditioning. Patients undergoing HSCT may also encounter side effects (ranging from mild to severe) that are unrelated to the administration of exa-cel. Patients will initially be monitored to determine when the edited cells begin to produce mature blood cells, a process known as engraftment. After engraftment, patients will continue to be monitored to track the impact of exa-cel on multiple measures of disease and for safety.About the Vertex and CRISPR CollaborationVertex and CRISPR Therapeutics entered into a strategic research collaboration in 2015 focused on the use of CRISPR/Cas9 to discover and develop potential new treatments aimed at the underlying genetic causes of human disease. Exa-cel represents the first potential treatment to emerge from the joint research program.

You can skip our detailed analysis of stocks in high-interest rate periods and the performance of dividend stocks, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks For Rising Interest Rates. The continuous interest rate hikes have been a cause of investors’ worry for quite some time now. On March 22, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter point, which was its ninth increase in a year. Moreover, Fed officials expect to hike interest rates to 5.1% by the end of the year in their effort to fight inflation, according to a report by New York Times.Rising interest rates can be challenging for nearly every sector, but some industries tend to perform better than others in this environment. For example, banks and other financial institutions typically benefit from growing interest rates since they charge higher rates on loans and earn more on their investments. Similarly, energy and utility sectors can be safe havens for investors during high-interest rate environments as they have predictable cash flows and solid dividend yields. According to a report by Charles Schwab, the energy and financial sectors returned 5% and 3%, respectively, relative to the broader market, in the year following the initial rate increase over the past five rate hike cycles from 1994 to 2015. Other sectors that outperformed the S&amp;P 500 during this period include communication services, healthcare, information technology, and utilities.Though dividend stocks may experience some headwinds during periods of high-interest rates, the impact is not always straightforward and may depend on the individual stock’s financial position, dividend history, and dividend yields. Companies that have strong dividend histories and solid financial health often outperform their peers and the broader market when interest rates are high. In our previous article, we reported that high-dividend stocks surpassed the S&amp;P 500 in 7 out of 10 rising interest rate periods from 1960 to 2017. We also highlighted the performance of companies with strong dividend growth histories between May 2005 and April 2015, when interest rates were high. The report revealed that the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index delivered an annual average return of 12.3%, compared with an 8.5% return of the Dow Jones US Select Dividend Index. Some of the best dividend stocks include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG).Story continuesIt's important to be careful when investing in high-interest rate periods because higher rates can have a significant impact on various aspects of the economy and financial markets.

During our nearly seven-year holding period, the company’s combination progressed leading to the realization of main catalysts we had identified. These included cost savings, broadened product offerings and an expanded customer base, as well as enhanced distribution capabilities and improved pricing due to scale. In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution. As such, we decided to step aside in favor of what we believe to be a more optimal investment in Blackstone.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Dividend Stocks For Rising Interest Rates.  Suggested articles:12 Best Growth Stocks to Buy for the Next 5 Years15 Best Low Priced Stocks to Buy Now12 Cheap Penny Stocks to Buy According to Hedge FundsDisclosure.

540,381cc1ef-909d-3faf-b574-8f59528fec87,KO,2023-04-05,Brokers Suggest Investing in Coke (KO): Read This Before Placing a Bet,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brokers-suggest-investing-coke-ko-133001481.html,1680615001,STORY,['KO'],"[The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Coca-Cola (KO).Coke currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.55, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 11 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.55 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 11 recommendations that derive the current ABR, eight are Strong Buy, representing 72.7% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for KOBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for KOCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Coke here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Coke, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is KO a Good Investment?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Coke, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $2.60.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Coke. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Coke.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This factor can impact your investment portfolio as well as help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.The fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Stryker (SYK) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to SYK for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Stryker's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Stryker's main business drivers.Headquartered in Kalamazoo, MI, Stryker Corporation is one of the world’s largest medical device companies operating in the global orthopedic market. The company has three business segments: Orthopaedics, MedSurg, and Neurotechnology &amp; Spine.Orthopaedic products primarily include implants used in hip and knee joint replacements and trauma and extremities surgeries.MedSurg products consists of surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems (Instruments); endoscopic and communications systems (Endoscopy); patient handling and emergency medical equipment (Medical); and reprocessed and remanufactured medical devices (Sustainability) as well as other medical device products used in a variety of medical specialties.Neurotechnology &amp; Spine division includes both neurosurgical and neurovascular devices. These includes products used for minimally invasive endovascular techniques; traditional brain and open skull base surgical procedures; orthobiologic and biosurgery products, including synthetic bone grafts and vertebral augmentation products; and minimally invasive products for the treatment of acute ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke.Spinal implant product offering includes cervical, thoracolumbar and interbody systems used in spinal injury, deformity and degenerative therapies.It is important to note here that effective from Dec 31, 2021, Stryker has updated its reportable business segments to align to its new internal reporting structure.Story continues2022 at a GlanceStryker’s full-year revenues totaled $18.45 billion, up 7.8% from the previous year. Adjusted earnings per share of $9.034 increased 2.8% from the previous year.Bottom LinePutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Stryker, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in April 2013 would be worth $4,407.05, or a 340.70% gain, as of April 4, 2023. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 gained 165.47% and the price of gold went up 22.79% over the same time frame.Going forward, analysts are expecting more upside for SYK.Stryker saw strong performance across both its segments in fourth-quarter 2022. Internationally, it reported mid-single-digit organic growth, highlighted by double-digit organic growth in Europe and emerging markets. A solid solvency position is a plus. Its fourth quarter results ended on a strongnote, wherein both earnings and revenues beat their estimates. Over the past year, Stryker outperformed the industry. Per management, the company managed to deliver robust growth in both of its businesses and demonstrated promising integration of Wright Medical despite the COVID-19 led disruptions. Strength in flagship Mako platform continues to favor the company. However, inflationary pressure and supply-chain challenges continue to plague Stryker.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Microchip Technology MCHP, DSV DSDVY and Trane Technologies TT.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:Rain Brings Wildflowers: Global Week AheadIn the Global Week Ahead, a fresh April Spring is in the air, at least here in California.Rains bring wildflower blooms.In the major money centers of the world, any banking crisis appears contained -- for the time being.With the turn of a month, and the end of Q1, it is time to look at how the real U.S. and global economy is faring.The winter quarter is over.On Monday, we get a March read on purchasing manager activity (PMIs) from the well-followed Institute of Supply Management (ISM).On Friday, the all-important March U.S. Federal monthly jobs report lands.In the Southern Hemisphere, policy rate decisions arrive via the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and their close counterpart, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ).If banking tension continues to recede?There should be sentiment for long-term U.S. Treasury yields to rise, and the U.S. dollar to regain safe haven ground, after a surprising March disappears.Next are Reuters’ five world market themes, reordered for equity traders—(1) On Friday, traders inspect March nonfarm payrolls.After weeks of worry about the banking sector, Friday’s U.S. employment data shifts the focus back to the macro picture.Traders will be keen to learn whether the Federal Reserve’s barrage of rate increases is cooling the economy.Views on the likely trajectory of rates have once again diverged. Fed officials project rates will remain around current levels for the rest of 2023 to help slow growth and fight inflation. A strong jobs number would support that view.Story continuesEconomists polled by Reuters expect a rise of 240,000 in March, so anything short of that would suggest the Fed could cut rates this year as tighter monetary policy bites and growth softens.That outlook — bolstered by the tumult in the banking sector — is one held by many investors.Futures markets are pricing a roughly 50% chance of a 25-basis-point rate increase at the central banks next meeting, in May, followed by cuts throughout the rest of 2023.(2) Will there be a recession in 2023, or 2024, or not?Turmoil in the banking sector, following the collapse of U.S. lender Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse's rescue merger with UBS, risks global banks adopting more austere lending standards as they strive to prove they are well-capitalized.Monthly purchasing managers indexes, the real-time indicators of business conditions, are due out in the first week of April. The early ""flash"" version of this survey for the U.S. showed manufacturers' new orders had fallen for the sixth straight month.Conviction is now building among investors and central bankers that banking stress and a potential follow-on credit crunch make a hard landing for the world's largest economy more likely.The optimistic take, for the equities market at least, is it brings central bank interest rate cuts into view, with stock-pickers focusing on high quality, defensive companies, in industries such as healthcare and consumer staples, that may weather a recession well.(3) What about the bond markets, after a banking crisis emerges?Two-year U.S. borrowing costs are about to post their sharpest drop since 2008 in March as banking turmoil wiped out bets on further central bank rate hikes.They dropped over 60 basis points, but don't forget they rose by a similar amount in February, when all the focus was on sticky inflation and a red-hot labor market.Bond markets were whipsawed this quarter and trading became so challenging that investors drew parallels with the market environment during Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the COVID-19 pandemic.Now, just as traders were settled to the idea that rate hikes would soon end, above-forecast German data on Thursday let the inflation genie back out of the bottle, sending bond yields sharply higher.Until markets get a clear sense of whether financial stability or inflation will drive central banks going forward, expect more turbulence.(4) What to make of the U.S. dollar?Spring is finally here, and the dollar has posted its weakest performance for the first quarter since 2018, falling -1.3%, despite the swell of safe-haven demand the banking crisis unleashed.Historically, Q1 is the strongest for the dollar. On average, over the last 50 years, the dollar has gained +1.1% between January and March, while Q4 is its weakest, with an average drop of -0.8%.Fund managers slashed their bearish positions during February's 2.5% rally, but they're still sitting on a short position of $5.289 billion, according to Refinitiv data.In theory, those bearish bets could be bought back and even flipped into bullish ones.Traders are short, but not that short. With maybe one more rate hike priced in, inflation cooling and the banking crisis contained — for now — there don't seem to be too many reasons to spring for the dollar.(5) On Tuesday, will the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) take up the policy rate?A recent run of tepid Australian data — along with continued risks of a banking crisis — have seen markets price out pretty much any chance for a rate hike on Tuesday by the Reserve Bank.In fact, there's even a sense that the 10-month tightening campaign may have run its course.A report on March 28th provided more evidence of tighter purse strings. Consumer price figures a day later backed the case that inflation has peaked, rounding out the data points that RBA officials said they would watch closely ahead of their decision.Across the Tasman, bets are still for the Reserve Bank of New Zealand to hike by another quarter point on Wednesday, and traders place a good chance of the same again by July.But markets don't expect the additional move needed to reach the central bank's own projected 5.5% peak.Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY) StocksI found three large cap stocks with long-term Zacks Growth scores of A or B.(1) Microchip Technology: This is a $83 a share stock. The company works in Semiconductors – Analog and Mixed and is based in Arizona. It has a market cap of $44.3B.

CINF currently has a PEG ratio of 1.24.Another notable valuation metric for RE is its P/B ratio of 1.66. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, CINF has a P/B of 1.67.Based on these metrics and many more, RE holds a Value grade of B, while CINF has a Value grade of C.Story continuesRE sticks out from CINF in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that RE is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. General Electric (GE) earns a Zacks Rank #2 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.13 a share, just 21 days from its upcoming earnings release on April 25, 2023.General Electric's Earnings ESP sits at 7.27%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.13 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.12.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Segmental revenues and orders climbed 22% year over year in 2022 due to robust consumer demand.In March, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company provided a bullish long-term view for the Aerospace segment. For 2025, the company expects the segment’s revenues to increase in the low-double digits to mid-teens. For the long term, General Electric predicts mid-single to high-single-digit revenue growth for the Aerospace segment. It expects continued margin expansion for the unit over the long term.After months of softness, a rebound in demand at the Power segment should foster GE’s growth. Encouragingly, onshore orders in North America more than doubled in the fourth quarter. Higher aeroderivative unit shipments drove an 8% increase in segmental revenues in the fourth quarter. The company expects low single-digit revenue growth for the Power segment in 2023 driven by Gas Power services.General Electric’s investments in innovation and productivity improvement should fuel its growth. Cost-control measures and pricing actions to tackle inflationary pressure are supporting the margin performance. GE’s adjusted profit margin increased 160 basis points organically in 2022. For 2023, management expects General Electric’s organic revenues to increase in high-single digits.General Electric’s commitment to reward its shareholders through dividends and share buybacks are encouraging. In March 2022, the company’s board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $3 billion. GE bought back approximately 13 million shares for $1 billion in 2022 under this authorization. In 2022, the company paid out dividends worth $639 million to shareholders, up 11.1% year over year.General Electric’s portfolio reshaping actions should facilitate its growth. The company has been acquiring businesses to expand operations while simultaneously divesting non-core operations to direct resources to key areas of growth. In January 2022, the company completed the acquisition of Opus One Solutions Energy Corporation. The Opus One buyout enhanced GE Digital’s capabilities to support the use of renewable and distributed energy resources.General Electric divested the GE Capital Aviation Services business in November 2021, the lighting business in July 2020 and the BioPharma business in March 2020. Benefits from restructuring initiatives are aiding the company’s bottom line.In November 2021, General Electric announced that it would split its businesses into three independent companies — comprising GE Healthcare, GE Aviation and GE Vernova —combining the operations of GE Digital, Renewable Energy and GE Power (to be complete in early 2024). The separation has been structured as tax-free spin-offs and is intended to strengthen the operating performance and the financial position. This January, GE completed the separation of its healthcare unit. General Electric will operate as an aviation-focused company starting in early 2024.Amid the positives, shares of General Electric have rallied 50% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 5.6% increase.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOther Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks worth considering are as follows:Deere &amp; Company DE currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

With higher global inventories and falling oil prices due to market uncertainty and the banking sector crisis, the reduction in oil output was in the cards. Although the decrease in daily production by 1.16 million barrels has led to a surge in oil prices, experts widely believe that this would result in a subdued growth in oil demand with even a likely supply deficit later this year.In addition, this is likely to fuel inflationary pressures and make the job harder for the Fed to hit the pause button on the rate hike program. The Fed had indicated that there might be just another hike in the current year after the recent quarter basis points (bps) hike in the interest rate, as tightening credit conditions could put pressure on the economy. However, equity markets appear to shrug off this pessimism with a steady string of gains.     As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they can benefit from “cash cow” stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. AutoNation, Inc. AN, Suzano S.A. SUZ, Valero Energy Corporation VLO, Hologic, Inc. HOLX and Ryder System, Inc. R are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.Why ROE?ROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Story continuesScreening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash-rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow lesser than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for $1 of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow-generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 20 stocks that qualified the screen:AutoNation: Incorporated in Delaware in 1991, AutoNation is the largest automotive retailer in the United States.

Per media reports, Shell asserted that it will remain active by supplying base oil, lubricants and biofuels to clients in Singapore and the surrounding regions. Meanwhile, it will be halting the exploration of two projects, a biofuels unit and a Group II base oil plant.In late 2021, Shell revealed that a 550,000-ton-per-year project to create sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for key Asian hubs like Singapore's Changi Airport and Hong Kong International Airport was under consideration. The company had anticipated making a final investment decision by the beginning of 2023.However, unlike in Europe and the United States, airlines in Asia are not mandated to use SAF. Owing to the absence of a regulation, consumers are reluctant to pay higher prices for SAF, making it an unprofitable business endeavor in the region.As one of the most difficult modes of transit to decarbonize, aviation generates 3% of global carbon emissions, making decarbonizing jet fuel an uphill battle. However, increased investment in SAFs has the potential to significantly aid the decarbonization of the aviation sector.In Rotterdam, the Netherlands, the company is presently constructing a biofuels plant with an annual capacity of 820,000 tons with a targeted output of roughly 2 million tons of SAF annually by 2025.The Singaporean project's suspension may be a short-term setback, but Shell's continuing investment in SAF keeps the ball rolling toward an aviation industry with a sustainable future.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCurrently, Shell carries a Zack Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Some better-ranked stocks for investors interested in the energy sector are CVR Energy CVI, Par Pacific Holdings Inc.

The pursuit of buyouts and a solid financial position are other tailwinds.Zacks Rank &amp; Price RallyUnitedHealth Group currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The stock has lost 9.6% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 9.8% decline. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Favorable Style ScoreUNH carries an impressive Value Score of A. Value Score helps find stocks that are undervalued. The back-tested results show that stocks with a Value Score of A or B in combination with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 are the best investment bets.Robust Growth ProspectsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for UnitedHealth Group’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $24.91 per share, which indicates an improvement of 12.3% from the year-ago reported figure. The same for revenues stands at $359 billion, implying 10.7% growth from the prior-year reported number.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings is pegged at $28.22 per share, marking 13.3% growth from the 2023 estimate.

Its earnings outpaced estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 4.38%.Solid Return on EquityUnitedHealth Group’s efficiency in utilizing shareholders’ funds can be substantiated by its trailing 12-month return on equity of 27%, which remains higher than the industry’s average of 24.6%.Robust 2023 OutlookUnitedHealth Group anticipates revenues between $357 billion and $360 billion, the mid-point of which indicates an improvement of 10.6% from the 2022 reported figure.Adjusted net earnings per share are estimated between $24.40 and $24.90 for the year. The mid-point of the updated guidance suggests 11.1% growth from the 2022 figure.Story continuesBusiness TailwindsRevenues of UnitedHealth Group continue to gain on the back of solid contributions from its UnitedHealthcare and Optum businesses. Through the UnitedHealthcare unit, UNH devises effective Medicare and Medicaid businesses, as well as integrates lucrative features within them from time to time. These affordable plans expand the membership base of the health insurer and fetch them growing premiums.The beneficial features of the plans have also given several contract wins or renewed agreements to UnitedHealth Group from the federal or state authorities. One of the most recent contract wins was in March 2023, wherein its Indiana unit won a contract from the Family and Social Services Administration (""FSSA"") of Indiana to serve the Medicaid beneficiaries of the state.Further, an aging U.S. population is likely to sustain a solid demand for UNH’s Medicare plans in the days ahead. Notably, the Commercial business falling under the UnitedHealthcare unit is witnessing a turnaround after facing a dismal period of membership decline following the COVID-19 pandemic.The Optum unit continues to benefit from numerous buyouts and the utilization of advanced technology, market-leading health analytics, modern care delivery and data-driven population health approaches.UnitedHealth Group has been pursuing collaborations with renowned healthcare providers to bolster its capabilities and solidify its nationwide presence. The health insurer has resorted to significant investments in developing efficient telehealth services, following the pandemic-induced inclination of patients to avail healthcare services virtually.A solid financial position is a dire need for companies that keep an eye on continued business investments. The same is the case with UnitedHealth Group, which boasts a growing cash balance and solid cash-generating abilities. Apart from growth-related initiatives, a sound financial stand instills confidence in UNH in the tactical deployment of capital through share buybacks and dividend payments.

You can skip our detailed analysis of stocks in high-interest rate periods and the performance of dividend stocks, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks For Rising Interest Rates. The continuous interest rate hikes have been a cause of investors’ worry for quite some time now. On March 22, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter point, which was its ninth increase in a year. Moreover, Fed officials expect to hike interest rates to 5.1% by the end of the year in their effort to fight inflation, according to a report by New York Times.Rising interest rates can be challenging for nearly every sector, but some industries tend to perform better than others in this environment. For example, banks and other financial institutions typically benefit from growing interest rates since they charge higher rates on loans and earn more on their investments. Similarly, energy and utility sectors can be safe havens for investors during high-interest rate environments as they have predictable cash flows and solid dividend yields. According to a report by Charles Schwab, the energy and financial sectors returned 5% and 3%, respectively, relative to the broader market, in the year following the initial rate increase over the past five rate hike cycles from 1994 to 2015. Other sectors that outperformed the S&amp;P 500 during this period include communication services, healthcare, information technology, and utilities.Though dividend stocks may experience some headwinds during periods of high-interest rates, the impact is not always straightforward and may depend on the individual stock’s financial position, dividend history, and dividend yields. Companies that have strong dividend histories and solid financial health often outperform their peers and the broader market when interest rates are high. In our previous article, we reported that high-dividend stocks surpassed the S&amp;P 500 in 7 out of 10 rising interest rate periods from 1960 to 2017. We also highlighted the performance of companies with strong dividend growth histories between May 2005 and April 2015, when interest rates were high. The report revealed that the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index delivered an annual average return of 12.3%, compared with an 8.5% return of the Dow Jones US Select Dividend Index. Some of the best dividend stocks include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG).Story continuesIt's important to be careful when investing in high-interest rate periods because higher rates can have a significant impact on various aspects of the economy and financial markets. To know more about this, readers can have a look at 12 Stocks That Benefit From Rising Interest Rates.Best Dividend Stocks For Rising Interest RatesPhoto by Nathan Dumlao on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we selected dividend stocks from sectors that either remain resilient or benefit in a rising interest rate environment.

These included cost savings, broadened product offerings and an expanded customer base, as well as enhanced distribution capabilities and improved pricing due to scale. In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution. As such, we decided to step aside in favor of what we believe to be a more optimal investment in Blackstone.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Dividend Stocks For Rising Interest Rates.  Suggested articles:12 Best Growth Stocks to Buy for the Next 5 Years15 Best Low Priced Stocks to Buy Now12 Cheap Penny Stocks to Buy According to Hedge FundsDisclosure.

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Procter &amp; Gamble (PG).P&amp;G currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.42, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 13 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.42 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 13 recommendations that derive the current ABR, nine are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 69.2% and 15.4% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for PGBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for PGCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for P&amp;G here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying P&amp;G, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is PG Worth Investing In?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for P&amp;G, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $5.84.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for P&amp;G. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for P&amp;G.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

574,7b873f56-eab5-3ac9-ba8f-a0dadaa2ecb0,PG,2023-04-05,Procter & Gamble Company (The) (PG) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/procter-gamble-company-pg-attracting-130001235.html,1680613201,STORY,['PG'],"[Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +6.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2% change. During this period, the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry, which P&amp;G falls in, has gained 5.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, P&amp;G is expected to post earnings of $1.32 per share, indicating a change of -0.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $5.84 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +0.5%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.27 indicates a change of +7.4% from what P&amp;G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for P&amp;G.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PG _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of P&amp;G, the consensus sales estimate of $19.32 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -0.3%. The $80.36 billion and $83.76 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +0.2% and +4.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryP&amp;G reported revenues of $20.77 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.9%. EPS of $1.59 for the same period compares with $1.66 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.61 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.81%. The EPS surprise was +0.63%.Over the last four quarters, P&amp;G surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.P&amp;G is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&amp;G. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Now, let's say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the ""safe"", mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years.

With the return of former CEO Bob Iger, cost-saving measures have been implemented, and the company plans to improve the guest experience in its parks, experiences, and products unit. Focusing on core brands and franchises like Star Wars, Avatar and the Marvel Cinematic Universe has driven engagement and sales. Despite pandemic effects, Disney's restructuring and cost-saving program are expected to make it more efficient and profitable in the future. Disney stock has risen 3.09% in the past six months, making it a good long-term investment.The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is a ‘Strong Buy’ with 17 buy ratings and an average price target of $128.41, representing a 28.24% increase from the current price of $100.13. The highest price target is $141.00, and the lowest is $110.00.According to Insider Monkey’s data, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) was part of 99 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q4 2022, compared to 112 in the Q3 2022. Trian Partners is the biggest stakeholder of The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), with 9.03 million shares worth $784.51 million.Meridian Funds made the following comment about The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Global entertainment giant The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) lagged the market as results in its theme park business missed expectations, due in part to recession-wary consumers and the continued pandemic-related shutdown of its resort in Shanghai. In addition, investor uncertainty around the long-term profitability of its streaming business continued, although Disney rolled out price increases and an advertising-supported tier of its Disney+ subscription service during the quarter. The company also changed its leadership, bringing former CEO Bob Iger back to the top job. While disappointed with the stock’s recent performance, we intend to stay patient as the company’s broad reservoir of iconic brands and related franchises provide multiple avenues for long-term value creation. In our view, the broader market continues to underestimate Disney’s franchise value and its earnings power.”6.

The company's stock is a good value, with a P/E ratio of 9.78x. It also pays an annual dividend yield of 3.07%. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (NYSE:JPM) is likely to emerge as one of the strongest banking plays on the market, and its position as the largest bank in the U.S. was highlighted when it deposited billions into First Republic Bank (NYSE:FRC).JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (NYSE:JPM) is currently rated as a ‘Moderate Buy’ by analysts, with 11 buy ratings and 4 hold ratings. The average price target for the stock is $153.73, with a high target of $189.00 and a low of $120.00. This suggests a potential increase of 17.97% from the current price of $130.31.Hedge fund interest in JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (NYSE:JPM) has lately decreased. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (NYSE:JPM) was in 100 hedge funds’ portfolios at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, down from 110 funds a quarter earlier. Greenhaven Associates, with 4.80 million shares, is the biggest stakeholder in the company.Along with Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Merck &amp; Co Inc. (NYSE:MRK), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (NYSE:JPM) is one of the Dow stocks on the radar of the investors.In its Q3 2022 investor letter, Vltava Fund stated the following about JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM):“We regard JPM to be the strongest and best- managed bank in the world. It is a leader in investment banking, commercial banking, credit cards, and asset management. Its size (the largest bank in the USA, with nearly USD 4,000 billion in assets) and diversification give it a strong competitive advantage that is compounded by its cost advantages and the high costs to clients associated with switching banks. JPM’s management prides itself on running the only large bank to avoid major instability over the long term.JP Morgan’s quality and strength first became fully evident in 2008 under the leadership of its CEO Jamie Dimon. Not only did JP Morgan help to stabilize the market by taking over the failing Bear Stearns in the spring of that year, but throughout the Great Financial Crisis it was the only big U.S. bank that did not require government assistance and it was highly profitable even in the difficult year of 2008.A well-functioning and efficient bank can be a very good long-term investment, because the interest compounding effect works well here. JPM’s return on equity (ROE) is well into the double digits and this puts it in a good position to continue producing better long-term returns than does the market. JPM has been very profitable even during years when interest rates were close to zero. The current – and perhaps not temporary – return to somewhat more normal, higher interest rates should have a significantly positive impact on the bank’s interest income and overall profitability.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Dow Stocks To Buy Right Now. Suggested articles:11 Best Dow Jones Dividend Stocks According to Hedge Funds15 Cheap Beginner Stocks to BuyStarter Stock Portfolio: 15 Safe Stocks To BuyDisclosure: None. 12 Best Dow Stocks To Buy Right Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

578,49dfc7e2-f4c5-37fc-b4dd-237ad6161435,VNO,2023-04-05,REITs Are Back In Favor With Analysts,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/reits-back-favor-analysts-154403839.html,1680536643,STORY,"['VNO', 'COLD', 'DEA', 'EGP']","[Analysts’ estimates of real estate investment trusts (REITs) have been on a roller coaster ride in 2023.After beginning the New Year with a slew of upgrades on REITs that had been badly battered throughout 2022, the analyst community was extremely quiet in February. Although there were dozens of Maintain and Reiterate ratings, not one analyst upgraded a REIT in February, and there were nine REITs that received downgrades.But as March comes to an end, REITs seem to be back in favor with analysts. Several factors are working in REITs’ favor right now. First, because many of them have already had their share prices trounced, the valuations and yields are becoming more enticingSecond, with the recent fears of bank failures, many on Wall Street predict the Federal Reserve rate hikes may be nearing an end — even if inflation persists above the Fed’s 2% target rate.Third, the weaker-than-expected forward guidance many REITs delivered for the first quarter of 2023 has already been factored into their prices, and perhaps analysts are looking further down the road.In the first half of March, only four REITs received analyst upgrades: Empire State Realty Trust Inc. (NYSE: ESRT), AGNC Investment Corp. (NASDAQ: AGNC), VICI Properties Inc. (NYSE: VICI) and Apartment Income REIT Corp. (NYSE: AIRC).The four REITs are in different sub-sectors. Empire State is an office REIT, AGNC is a mortgage REIT (mREIT), VICI Properties is a diversified REIT with gaming properties and Apartment Income is a residential REIT.The trend of analysts upgrading REITs has continued more vigorously through the second half of March, and the upgraded REITs again are in different subsectors. This is a much healthier sign for REITs than if analysts were only upgrading one or two specific subsectors.Here’s a look at the most recent analyst upgrades:Eastgroup Properties Inc. (NYSE: EGP) is an industrial REIT that owns and operates properties in major Sun Belt markets, with an emphasis on Florida, Texas, Arizona, California and North Carolina. Eastgroup is a member of the S&amp;P MidCap 400 and Russell 1000 indices.Story continuesOn March 20, Mizuho analyst Vikram Malhotra upgraded Eastgroup Properties from Neutral to Buy while raising the price target from $180 to $185.Vornado Realty Trust (NYSE: VNO) is a diversified (office, retail, apartment and advertising) REIT with a large presence in New York City, Chicago and San Francisco. A member of the S&amp;P Midcap 400, Vornado Realty has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 1962. Vornado Realty owns and operates over 26 million square feet of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)-certified buildings.On March 21, Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Goldfarb upgraded Vornado Realty from Underweight to Neutral but cut its price target from $18 to $16.Regency Centers Corp. (NASDAQ: REG) is a Jacksonville, Florida-based retail REIT that owns and operates 404 properties in higher-income areas, mostly on the U.S. East Coast. Its portfolio includes groceries, restaurants, service providers, medical spaces and higher-class retailers.On March 23, Barclays analyst Ross Smotrich upgraded Regency Centers from Equal-Weight to Overweight and raised the price target from $69 to $70.Americold Realty Trust Inc. (NYSE: COLD) is an Atlanta-based industrial REIT that specializes in owning and operating temperature-controlled warehouses. Americold has over 240 locations across the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Argentina.On March 23, Barclays analyst Anthony Powell upgraded Americold Realty from Underweight to Equal-Weight and raised the price target from $30 to $32.Equinix Inc. (NASDAQ: EQIX) is a specialized data center REIT that owns and operates a network of over 240 data centers across 71 major metropolitan areas, providing critical infrastructure to over 260 Fortune 500 companies around the world.On March 27, BMO Capital Markets analyst Ari Klein upgraded Equinix from Market Perform to Outperform, while raising the price target from $755 to $785.Easterly Government Properties Inc. (NYSE: DEA) is an office REIT that acquires, develops and manages Class A commercial properties and leases them to government agencies through the General Services Administration. Easterly Government Properties owns 86 properties in 26 states. Its occupancy rate is above 99%.On March 28, Compass Point Research &amp; Trading analyst Merrill Ross upgraded Easterly Government Properties from Neutral to Buy while setting a $17 price target.Analysts are not always correct, and investors should perform due diligence before acquiring any stock. But it’s a promising sign that analysts are returning to more positive positions in the REIT sector.Check Out More on Real Estate from BenzingaBezos-Backed Startup Lets You Become A Landlord With $100If You Invested $10K In American Tower 5 years Ago, Here's How Much You Would Be Making In Dividends TodayTechies Will Soon Flood Austin Even Harder.

579,99b674d1-e05c-3dc4-9cb6-528c13bd8f02,DHI,2023-04-05,Homebuilder stocks are trying to tell us something about the U.S. housing market,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/homebuilder-stocks-trying-tell-us-180111578.html,1680631271,STORY,"['DHI', 'LEN-B']","[On paper, the U.S. housing market remains constrained. Last week, mortgage purchase applications were down 35% on a year-over-year basis, as spiked mortgage rates continued to keep some buyers on the sideline, while the number of homes for sale in March 2023 was 20% below levels seen in March 2022 as ""move-up"" sellers refuse to swap their mortgage rates of around 2% to 3% for something in the 6% range. But a constrained national housing market doesn't equal a crashing housing market. At least that's the message from Wall Street, which has helped to push up the share price of major homebuilders, like D.R. Horton and Lennar, back near their all-time highs.So what are investors seeing that buyers and sellers aren't? The new-home market has gained an advantage over the existing-home market. Not only does the existing/resale market have little inventory available for sale, it has also been stickier on the price side, with many sellers refusing to budge. That lack of competition, coupled with sky-high existing home prices, gives builders an edge if they're able to offer some discounts like mortgage rate buydowns.Following the 2000s housing boom, which topped out in 2007, builders across the country wiped out as their rampant overbuilding turned into a supply glut, which of course only exacerbated the crash. Fast-forward to the Pandemic Housing Boom, and builders were better positioned for a shift from boom to slump in 2022. This time around, there was neither a building glut of inventory nor a subprime mortgage crisis.""They’re [builders] working with [profit] margins that allow them to do those things [offer discounts]. They do have budgets for incentives, where they’ll spread around where it’s most effective. They have to move forward,"" Jeff Grenz, a custom builder in Sacramento, tells Fortune. ""The bottom line this year might not be as great, but they’ll still move forward and make those sales happen. Besides, in a lot of cases, they’re it. Resale isn’t putting inventory on the market.""Story continuesDuring the Pandemic Housing Boom—a period of seemingly unlimited housing demand—builders including D.R. Horton and Lennar achieved frothy profit margins as they swiftly jacked up their prices. That is coming in handy right now: Those sky-high profit margins gave builders breathing room to reduce margins (i.e., cutting prices and/or aggressive rate buydowns) in pursuit of finding the market, or the price point at which buyer demand would return. And it's working.View this interactive chart on Fortune.comHomebuilder stocks might also be trying to tell us something else: The worst of the housing slump could be in the rearview mirror.The reason? Last year's mortgage rate spike—the culprit of the housing slump—is beginning to lose its punch. Over the past five months, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate has slowly come down from its November high of 7.37% to 6.44% as of Monday. That mortgage rate dip, coupled with rising incomes and national home prices falling a bit from the peak, has seen housing affordability improve just enough to get some buyers back into the market.View this interactive chart on Fortune.comWant more proof that the worst of the storm might be behind us? Just look at homebuilder cancellation rates.Builders surveyed by John Burns Real Estate Consulting in February had an aggregate cancellation rate of 10.8%. That's far below the peak of 24.6% hit in October, and just slightly above the 7.3% hit at the height of the Pandemic Housing Boom in February 2022.Not to mention, existing home prices are rising again this spring in many Midwest and East Coast housing markets.Want to stay updated on the housing market?

This company, which is in the Zacks Transportation - Airline industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.When looking at the last two reports, this world's largest airline has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 15.20%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the most recent quarter, American Airlines was expected to post earnings of $1.14 per share, but it reported $1.17 per share instead, representing a surprise of 2.63%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.54 per share, while it actually produced $0.69 per share, a surprise of 27.78%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor American Airlines, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.American Airlines currently has an Earnings ESP of +592.31%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

581,a66fcbdf-9573-3dba-ad57-5bfeac2b737d,AAL,2023-04-05,American Airlines (AAL) to Trim Flights Due to FAA Staff Crunch,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-airlines-aal-trim-flights-131401629.html,1680614041,STORY,"['AAL', 'CPA', 'JBLU']","[American Airlines AAL is reportedly the latest U.S. carrier to cut flights in the New York City area this summer. This move comes after the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced a plan last month to bring down flight disruptions in the wake of air traffic controller shortages.This will reduce passenger harassment as air-travel demand has soared following the pandemic. The same is expected to move further north in the upcoming summer season.AAL has decided to reduce the frequency of flights between LaGuardia Airport and Dallas, Miami, Kansas City and St. Louis. It will also operate fewer flights on the Newark Liberty International Airport-Chicago route.Due to its staffing shortage, FAA has allowed the reduction of flight requirements by up to 10% for airlines’ takeoff and landing rights to avoid congestion in the New York City area and Washington, D.C. The waivers will last for four months from May 15.To ensure the smooth flow of operations and prevent a repeat of the 2022 experience where flight cancellations and delays were rampant, FAA will allow airlines to reduce operations during the peak summer travel period. To minimize passenger harassment, airlines can opt to use larger planes.Notably, the agency held a meeting last month, featuring industry leaders, to discuss how to best manage the congested airspace around New York in view of the staffing shortage. JetBlue Airways JBLU, too, intends to reduce weekly flights in the New York City area this spring and summer due to the shortage of air traffic controllers.Per JetBlue’s CEO Robin Hayes, “We don’t want to pull down flights. I’m sure no airline wants to pull down flights. But if we don’t cut them the system is not going to be workable this summer.”Currently, American Airlines carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) while JetBlue carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Investors interested in the Zacks Airline industry may consider Copa Holdings CPA, which currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

In fourth-quarter 2022, passenger revenues increased 29.5%, owing to higher yields. CPA’s focus on its cargo segment is encouraging too.In fourth-quarter 2022, cargo and mail revenues grew 69%, owing to higher cargo volumes and yields. Copa Holdings' fleet modernization and cost-management efforts are commendable as well.The abovementioned tailwinds are likely to continue aiding this Latin American carrier.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: American Airlines AAL, Copa Holdings CPA and JetBlue Airways JBLU.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:Airline Industry Appreciates 7.1% in Q1: More Upside Ahead?It is no secret that the airline industry was one of the worst-hit corners during the pandemic. After being battered in 2020 and 2021, with passenger revenues shrinking drastically, the fortunes of the industry players turned for the better in 2022 as air traffic (particularly for leisure) started bouncing back following the easing of the pandemic-induced restrictions.The scenario has brightened further this year with business travel making a recovery. Leisure travel trends are strong as well with vacationers making up for lost time. The resurgence in air-travel demand is solely responsible for the Zacks Airline industry gaining 7.1% in first-quarter 2023 (January-March period) despite headwinds like inflation-induced economic uncertainty and high fuel costs.The bright scenario is highlighted by data provided by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) with respect to passenger volumes. In the January-March period this year, TSA checkpoint numbers revealed that passenger volumes not only surpassed 2022 levels but also exceeded 2019 (pre-coronavirus) numbers on many days.Airlines Likely to Fly High Throughout 2023The buoyancy with respect to passenger volumes, witnessed in the first quarter of the year, is likely to remain throughout the year. In fact, the scenario is likely to get brighter in the United States in the upcoming summer season. Many U.S. airlines are adjusting their summer schedules to meet the anticipated demand swell.Passenger volumes are high not only in the United States but globally. This led the International Air Transport Association (IATA) to expect airlines to return to profitability this year. Net profits for airlines across the globe are likely to be $4.7 billion in 2023.Story continuesWith people again taking to the skies, passenger revenues, which account for the bulk of the top line for most airlines, are likely to regain their lost glory in 2023. Per IATA, passenger revenues for the current year are anticipated to be $522 billion (85.5% of 2019 levels).The focus of airlines on boosting cargo revenues is an added positive. IATA anticipates 2023 cargo revenues to be around $150 billion, suggesting an increase of nearly $48.6 billion from the pre-pandemic level of 2019.3 Airline Stocks to Keep a Tab OnGiven this buoyant scenario, we believe that investors interested in the Zacks Airline industry should keep stocks like American Airlines, Copa Holdings and JetBlue Airways on their watchlist for healthy returns. Driven by the stronger-than-expected recovery in air-travel demand, all the abovementioned stocks have outperformed the industry with respect to price in the first quarter of this year.Copa Holdings is benefiting from the improvement in air-travel demand. In fourth-quarter 2022, passenger revenues increased 29.5%, owing to higher yields. CPA’s focus on its cargo segment is encouraging too. In fourth-quarter 2022, cargo and mail revenues grew 69%, owing to higher cargo volumes and yields. Copa Holdings' fleet modernization and cost-management efforts are commendable as well.The abovementioned tailwinds are likely to continue aiding this Latin American carrier, currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

AAL has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AAL’s current-year earnings has improved 10.8% over the past 60 days. AAL delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 7.79%, on average.JetBlue Airways is benefiting from the buoyant air-travel-demand scenario and fleet-upgrade efforts. With air-travel demand expected to remain strong going forward as well, management expects total revenues for 2023 to increase year over year in the high single-digit to low double-digit range.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings at JetBlue has been revised 9.4% upward over the past 60 days.  JBLU, presently, has a Growth Score of B and carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

585,c8b1487f-27e8-39b0-b4e0-a002623bed61,AAL,2023-04-05,2 Stocks to Buy for the Spring Season,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-stocks-buy-spring-season-214609834.html,1680558369,STORY,"['AAL', 'HRB', '^GSPC']","[With April here, several companies will be beneficiaries of this year's spring season. Even better, their stocks appear attractively valued considering the boost they may receive.Let's take a look at two such stocks that investors may want to consider buying right now.American Airlines (AAL) With warmer weather on the way, American Airlines Stock (AAL) is worthy of consideration sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).As the largest airline in the U.S. in terms of passangers, American Airlines should benefit as we get closer to peak travel season which is typically May-October. Furthermore, travel is expected to be higher in 2023 with pent-up demand lingering from the pandemic.Notably, American Airlines’ earnings estimates have continued to trend higher in the last week. More impressive, fiscal 2023 earnings estimates have now climbed 38% over the last 90 days with FY24 EPS estimates up 9%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAmerican Airlines earnings are now forecasted to rebound and soar 352% this year at $2.26 per share compared to EPS of $0.50 in 2022. Fiscal 2024 earnings are expected to jump another 21% to $2.74 per share.Sales are projected to be up 9% in FY23 and rise another 3% in FY24 to $55.53 billion. Plus, fiscal 2024 sales would be 21% above pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $45.76 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat makes American Airlines’ recovery more intriguing is the company’s price-to-earnings valuation. Shares of AAL trade at $14 and just 6.5X forward earnings. This is nicely below the industry average of 12.1X and the S&amp;P 500’s 19X.American Airlines stock also trades 70% below its historical high of 21.1X and slightly beneath the median of 6.9X since its merger and formation with US Airways in 2013. Shares of AAL are up +13% year to date to top the S&amp;P 500 and the Transportation-Airline Markets +7% performances.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchH&amp;R Block (HRB)Progressing through the spring, we will round out this year’s tax season on April 18 and H&amp;R Block (HRB) stock could benefit. As a leading provider of tax preparation services H&amp;R Block's stock also sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at the moment.Story continuesEarnings estimates revisions have trended higher over the last two months. H&amp;R Block’s earnings are now expected to rise 10% in FY23 and jump another 10% in FY24 at $4.27 per share. On the top line, sales are forecasted to be up 2% this year and rise another 3% in FY24 to $3.65 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchH&amp;R Block’s P/E valuation also sticks out at the moment. Shares of HRB trade at $35 and 9.1X forward earnings which is below its industry average of 11X and the benchmark. H&amp;R Block stock also trades 54% below its decade-long high of 19.7X and at a 31% discount to the median of 13.2X.H&amp;R Block stock is down -3% YTD to slightly trail the Consumer Services-Miscellaneous Markets +1% and the S&amp;P 500. However, this year's slight drop may be a buying opportunity as shares of HRB are still up a stellar +160% over the last three years to largely outperform the benchmark’s +55% and its Zack Subindustry’s -22%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeawayRising earnings estimates are a great sign that business should be stronger for American Airlines and H&amp;R Block as we progress through the spring. This should also translate into more upside in American Airlines and H&amp;R Block stock, especially when considering their attractive P/E valuations.Furthermore, at their current levels, both American Airlines and H&amp;R Block look like viable investments for 2023 and beyond considering their solid outlooks.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The APA is holding a strike authorization vote this month to put pressure on the company to fast-track the contract negotiations.Both American Airlines and United Airlines have promised an ""industry-leading"" contract to their pilots.They are now facing calls from their unions to deliver on that promise after pilots at rival Delta Air Lines ratified a new contract that includes over $7 billion in cumulative increases in pay and benefits over four years.""Every day that passes is a day our pilots labor under a sub-standard agreement that is problematic to both our careers and the certainty of American Airlines' operation,"" the APA said.American Airlines Chief Executive Robert Isom has said the company is prepared to match the pay rates and profit-sharing formula that Delta has provided in its new pilot contract.

Plan sponsors that choose Principal® Intelligent QDIA will provide participants with a path to greater personalization as their careers and lives evolve since the hybrid QDIA offers both target date strategies as well as a managed account service in one default option.Unless a different investment election is made during enrollment, participants younger than the plan’s set transition age (e.g. 45 years old) will be defaulted into a target date fund. Once participants reach the plan’s set transition age, they will automatically move to a managed account service that will enable tailored investment strategies that consider more than age by using additional factors such as contribution levels, account balance, and social security benefit. Participants can further refine the strategy by inputting additional financial and goal-based information such as other retirement accounts, desired retirement age, planned retirement expenses, and lifestyle in retirement.""We know from research and our direct conversations with customers that personalized investment advice has become a need for retirement savers,"" said Brett Fisher, head of investment product strategy for Retirement and Income Solutions at Principal®. ""Principal® Intelligent QDIA can help participants feel more confident in their financial futures by getting them started on a savings path for retirement before ultimately helping them manage the wealth they’ve accumulated.""Hybrid QDIAs have become more attractive over the past two years. The number of plan sponsors adopting them as the default investment option increased 67% year-over-year from 2020 to 20211. Going into 2023, 86% of plan sponsors and 76% of financial professionals Principal surveyed agreed the most common default option by 2030 will likely be a target date fund with a managed account service2.Story continuesParticipants also acknowledge the value of advice, indicating their investing confidence increases from 35% to 65% when receiving professional help.3""Our ultimate goal is to give participants a holistic view of their financial outlooks so we can help them determine what may be necessary to reach their retirement goals,"" Fisher said.

593,189a8fef-cd54-3c9a-b6ea-ad53b1c11e60,FRT,2023-04-05,3 Top Dividend Stocks to Buy Now for an Income-Based Portfolio,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-top-dividend-stocks-buy-204406663.html,1680295446,STORY,"['O', 'JNJ', 'FRT']","[The start of a bull market is a good time to look for dividend stocks to buy. Is this the start of a new one? It could be, but we still have plenty of issues to sort through. For that reason, among many others, investors are still going to be on the hunt for the best dividend stocks to buy. Specifically, they’ll constantly be looking for names to build an income-based portfolio with.Whether they consider themselves growth investors, tech investors, value investors, or income-oriented investors, dividends provide a great deal of information.Companies that are able to not only pay but raise their annual dividend year in and year out tend to have rather sound businesses. That criterion isn’t the only factor that matters of course, but it shines a light on decades worth of consistency and execution.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBecause these stocks consistently raise their payouts and the names below do run solid businesses, they can become cornerstones of one’s portfolio. In other words, building blocks for future growth and income.Let’s look at a few dividend stocks to buy now.Realty Income (O)realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browserSource: ShutterstockI really like the long-term story of Realty Income (NYSE:O). The one complaint is obvious: The stock price continues to teeter between “reverse” and “neutral.”It has been unable to sustain any meaningful upside rally, and I don’t just mean over the last year. Realty Income feels like one of the rare stocks that was unable to take out its pre-pandemic high. Despite a bull market that surged from the second quarter of 2020 until the very end of 2021, Realty Income failed to gain much upside traction.That’s even as the share price was obliterated during the Covid-19 selloff.Despite all the volatility, and the sluggish price appreciation, the company continues to dole out its dividend. Paid out monthly, Realty Income has now raised its dividend payout in 102 consecutive quarters. Forget annual raises. This company has raised its payout quarterly for more than 25 years.Story continuesDespite Covid, various selloffs, high rates, low rates and a financial crisis, the company has not skipped a beat. While it could be years before O stock takes out its all-time high, that simply gives investors time to accumulate the name and its 5% yield.Federal Realty (FRT)Commercial shopping center in a tropical climateSource: mTaira / Shutterstock.comConsidered one of the most dependable, blue-chip REIT holdings, Federal Realty (NYSE:FRT) has built its legacy on dependability. The company has accumulated properties in some of the strongest markets with strong tenants.In the words of Federal Realty: “We own, operate and develop award-winning retail environments and mixed-use neighborhoods in the nation’s most desirable markets.”For years, the stock paid a small dividend yield, often paying out less than 3%. However, that’s not due to stinginess. Instead, it’s because the stock always traded with a rich premium. Now like Realty Income, this top-tier REIT stock has been under pressure.In 2022, the company raised its dividend for the 55th straight year. That’s “the longest record of consecutive annual dividend increases in the REIT sector,” according to the company.Now yielding 4.5%, shares do seem quite attractive at current prices. If commercial real estate and/or REITs, in general, come under pressure, FRT stock won’t be immune. However, in the long term, Federal Realty and Realty Income should be high-quality building blocks.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)Animated image of different medicationsSource: Olga Kononok/ShutterstockLast but certainly not least, we have Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). Unlike the others on this list, JNJ stock doesn’t have as big of a dividend yield. Shares pay out a dividend yield of roughly 3% and even that yield is only a product of the stock’s prolonged correction.Despite the positives, the share price has declined for nine straight weeks, falling over 16% in that span. While not great for intermediate-term holders, it does give buyers a chance to establish a long position.Over the years, JNJ has become a very dependable stock. While most stocks were rolling over to multi-month or multi-quarter lows in April 2022, Johnson &amp; Johnson stock was hitting all-time highs.Because of the company’s high-quality business, the stock has become a high-quality blue-chip holding.

""Despite a weak construction outlook, 36% of survey respondents have a larger backlog now than they did at this time in 2019, and 20% have a 10+% larger backlog.""The survey consisted of 45 professional paint contractors from across the U.S. who spend more than $5,000 annually on paint. About 7% of the survey respondents spend more than $100,000 annually.""This [report] seems to match some of our recent calls with paint contractors who highlighted high 2023 bidding activity and lofty backlogs, particularly in commercial end markets,"" Byrne added. ""The largest contractors ($100+k/yr in paint spend) had the greatest backlogs. This should provide a more favorable volume outlook in the first half for paint suppliers, but with potential contraction in the second half.""The economic vibe from paint demand is one of strength, thinks Bank of America.The findings have direct implications for ""paint stocks,"" Byrne noted:Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW): ""The resilience of pro backlogs bodes favorably for Buy-rated Home Depot and Lowe's, for whom sales to pros comprise about 50% and 30% of their respective totals.""Sherwin-Williams (SHW): ""These data are clearly favorable for the near-term earnings outlook for Sherwin, but we remain Neutral due to a more cautious second half outlook for U.S. residential and commercial construction.""PPG (PPG), Masco (MAS), and Axalta (AXTA): ""We remain Buy-rated on PPG and Axalta due to the auto and refinish exposures. We maintain our Underperform rating on Masco to reflect our view that do-it-yourself (65% of Behr brand sales) paint demand remains under pressure against difficult comparisons.""Craftswoman, painter, and interior designer works at a client's place on March 5, 2015.

But by and large, the demand signals offer a message of economic resilience headed into the spring shopping season.""Our respondents may have slightly overestimated the 2023 paint demand growth as the 2023 paint volume growth expectation (vs COVID) is lower than it was in our October survey,"" Byrne said.

(NYSE:AWK) institutional owners",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/following-10-decline-over-last-134023583.html,1680529223,STORY,['AWK'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies American Water Works Company's stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsThe top 21 shareholders own 51% of the company Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a businessIf you want to know who really controls American Water Works Company, Inc. (NYSE:AWK), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 83% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).After a year of 10% losses, last week’s 3.4% gain would be welcomed by institutional investors as a likely sign that returns might start trending higher.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of American Water Works Company. See our latest analysis for American Water Works Company ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About American Water Works Company?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that American Water Works Company does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of American Water Works Company, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. American Water Works Company is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 12% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.6% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.4% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 21 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of American Water Works CompanyThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of American Water Works Company, Inc. in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$47m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 16% stake in American Water Works Company. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

(NASDAQ:PEP) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for PepsiCo PepsiCo Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Independent Director, Robert Pohlad, for US$13m worth of shares, at about US$174 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$182. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was just 6.6% of Robert Pohlad's stake.In the last year PepsiCo insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.PepsiCo Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of PepsiCo shares. In total, insiders sold US$16m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesInsider OwnershipFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. PepsiCo insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$413m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At PepsiCo Tell Us?Insiders haven't bought PepsiCo stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. But since PepsiCo is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. For example - PepsiCo has 3 warning signs we think you should be aware of.Of course PepsiCo may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

You can skip our detailed analysis of stocks in high-interest rate periods and the performance of dividend stocks, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks For Rising Interest Rates. The continuous interest rate hikes have been a cause of investors’ worry for quite some time now. On March 22, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter point, which was its ninth increase in a year. Moreover, Fed officials expect to hike interest rates to 5.1% by the end of the year in their effort to fight inflation, according to a report by New York Times.Rising interest rates can be challenging for nearly every sector, but some industries tend to perform better than others in this environment. For example, banks and other financial institutions typically benefit from growing interest rates since they charge higher rates on loans and earn more on their investments. Similarly, energy and utility sectors can be safe havens for investors during high-interest rate environments as they have predictable cash flows and solid dividend yields. According to a report by Charles Schwab, the energy and financial sectors returned 5% and 3%, respectively, relative to the broader market, in the year following the initial rate increase over the past five rate hike cycles from 1994 to 2015. Other sectors that outperformed the S&amp;P 500 during this period include communication services, healthcare, information technology, and utilities.Though dividend stocks may experience some headwinds during periods of high-interest rates, the impact is not always straightforward and may depend on the individual stock’s financial position, dividend history, and dividend yields. Companies that have strong dividend histories and solid financial health often outperform their peers and the broader market when interest rates are high. In our previous article, we reported that high-dividend stocks surpassed the S&amp;P 500 in 7 out of 10 rising interest rate periods from 1960 to 2017. We also highlighted the performance of companies with strong dividend growth histories between May 2005 and April 2015, when interest rates were high. The report revealed that the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index delivered an annual average return of 12.3%, compared with an 8.5% return of the Dow Jones US Select Dividend Index. Some of the best dividend stocks include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG).Story continuesIt's important to be careful when investing in high-interest rate periods because higher rates can have a significant impact on various aspects of the economy and financial markets. To know more about this, readers can have a look at 12 Stocks That Benefit From Rising Interest Rates.Best Dividend Stocks For Rising Interest RatesPhoto by Nathan Dumlao on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we selected dividend stocks from sectors that either remain resilient or benefit in a rising interest rate environment.

These included cost savings, broadened product offerings and an expanded customer base, as well as enhanced distribution capabilities and improved pricing due to scale. In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution. As such, we decided to step aside in favor of what we believe to be a more optimal investment in Blackstone.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Dividend Stocks For Rising Interest Rates.  Suggested articles:12 Best Growth Stocks to Buy for the Next 5 Years15 Best Low Priced Stocks to Buy Now12 Cheap Penny Stocks to Buy According to Hedge FundsDisclosure.

We provide you with the tools and allies you need to accelerate your career, enter the C-suite, and make a positive impact on business. Join live events with Fortune 500 leaders and build your network by visiting https://fortune.com/connect.PepsiCo, aside from boasting a $250 billion market cap, has an ace up its sleeve that few other corporations can claim: The company produces CEOs at an unrivaled pace. In the industry, many call Pepsi a “talent academy.”“Did you ever notice how many CEOs come from PepsiCo?” Fortune senior writer Phil Wahba asked PepsiCo’s chief human resources officer, Ronald Schellekens, in an exclusive Fortune Connect panel last week. Wahba rattled off a handful of companies currently held by PepsiCo alums: Target, Dick’s Sporting Goods, Ulta Beauty, Petco, Vail Resorts. In fact, there are 16 Fortune 500 CEOs who have some PepsiCo pedigree—third behind McKinsey and General Electric.Schellekens attributes this to being “a very people-sensitive company,” he said. “We have very little ownership. The belief is very deeply embedded in the company that our leaders make a difference internally and in our industry.”As a result, company leaders are “super committed” to continuously cultivating great general managers and future CEOs. Clearly, their methods are working—not just with chief executives, but with general managers and finance leaders.PepsiCo’s strong leadership development program relies on managers’ watchful eye on their direct reports, always rooting around for the highest performers, who earn the untold status of “hi-po,” or high-potential person. (See Indra Nooyi, who led PepsiCo as CEO from 2006 to 2018.) Bosses then give those workers challenges and resources—tests to see if they rise to the occasion and benchmarks for eventually landing in C-suite jobs.This is where Schellekens’ unorthodox approach comes in: He and his fellow PepsiCo executives refer to these high-potential people as corporate assets.Story continues“Basically we [tell managers that] ownership of these great people is being taken away from you. They are not owned by the corporation, or by you as an individual manager,” Schellekens said. The strategy is meant to ensure PepsiCo lets its best people tackle its biggest challenges—while providing them with the best development.“The fact that we call them corporate assets—their [talents are] owned by the executive committee, and the keys are handed over to the HR function, to steer the assets so they get the best development, and we deploy them [for the] corporation’s biggest challenges,” Schellekens said.Hi-po, meet “corporate asset” Schellekens said the “people as assets” approach is well-understood across the vast company’s culture. He should know; he spent nearly a decade at PepsiCo before leaving to lead HR at Royal Dutch Shell and Vodafone, two of the largest European businesses, before boomeranging back to Pepsi in 2018.He acknowledged that people may not like the approach, especially when executives start pulling assets aside to work on major company issues. But managers understand that they don’t own people anymore—and they trust that executives will staff the assets on the most fitting projects.A prime example of the company’s insistence on maintaining its “talent academy” reputation: PepsiCo never has—and Schellekens said it never will—waver on its commitment to hiring 2,000 graduates in the U.S. each year.“We need to do this, because otherwise we're not building the pipeline,” he said. “That requires, I think, a kind of institutionalized culture where we say okay, this is the belief of the company. This is how we build leaders for the future.”It’s in everyone’s best interest—workers and managers—to work at a company that values its employees and is committed to growth. Further, cultivating existing talent should be a greater investment than “fit-for-purpose” hiring, he said.“We don't like it when people leave our company and become CHRO or CEO of another company, but they always leave us for much bigger jobs. Very rarely does someone leave us for a lateral [position],” Schellekens said. “They always make a big jump.”Despite the potentially polarizing move to refer to people as assets, Schellekens nonetheless thinks it’s good practice to always be assessing workers’ potential, unashamedly. “It’s a little bit elitist to say, although we love all of our people, we love, let's say, 20% of our population more because these people have more value and future value for the company. And therefore we invest in this proportion,” he acknowledged.To balance that out, he said, PepsiCo has built a culture where upward mobility is not a given—even for the highest achieving workers. Still, his commitment to advancement resonates among PepsiCo workers.“We have a large cadre of people who have been here for 20 or 30 years,” he told Wahba. That’s because, he believes, the company tries to build a career proposition for 80% of its population to receive a promotion. If that figure wavers, he thinks it’s because managers aren’t moving people at the right velocity.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeExpert advice to keep your money safe during bank failuresThe young creators of a ""TED meets Burning Man"" conference bought a $40-million mountain.

Now, they confront the most lethal opponent they've ever faced: A terrifying threat emerging from the shadows of the past who's fueled by blood revenge, and who is determined to shatter this family and destroy everything—and everyone—that Dom loves, forever.In 2011's Fast Five, Dom and his crew took out nefarious Brazilian drug kingpin Hernan Reyes and decapitated his empire on a bridge in Rio De Janeiro. What they didn't know was that Reyes' son, Dante (Aquaman's Jason Momoa), witnessed it all and has spent the last 12 years masterminding a plan to make Dom pay the ultimate price.Dante's plot will scatter Dom's family from Los Angeles to the catacombs of Rome, from Brazil to London and from Portugal to Antarctica. New allies will be forged and old enemies will resurface. But everything changes when Dom discovers that his own 8-year-old son (Leo Abelo Perry, Black-ish) is the ultimate target of Dante's vengeance.Directed by Louis Leterrier (Clash of the Titans, The Incredible Hulk), Fast X stars returning cast members Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, Jason Statham, John Cena and Scott Eastwood, with Oscar® winner Helen Mirren and Oscar® winner Charlize Theron.The film also features an extraordinary new cast including Oscar® winner Brie Larson as Tess, a rogue representative from the Agency; Alan Richtson (Reacher) as Aimes, the new head of the Agency who doesn't hold the same fondness for Dom's crew as his predecessor, Mr. Nobody; Daniela Melchior (The Suicide Squad) as a Brazilian street racer with a powerful tie to Dom's past; and legendary Oscar® winner Rita Moreno as Dom and Mia's Abuelita Toretto.Fast X is produced by Neal H.

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Regeneron (REGN) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $10.13 a share, just 29 days from its upcoming earnings release on May 3, 2023.Regeneron's Earnings ESP sits at 6.78%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $10.13 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.49.REGN is one of just a large database of Medical stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Amgen (AMGN).Amgen is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on April 26, 2023. AMGN's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $4.50 a share 22 days from its next earnings release.Amgen's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 14.54% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.93.Story continuesREGN and AMGN's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

That is, there were more number of shares sold by insiders than there were purchased.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Regeneron PharmaceuticalsOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Independent Director, Arthur Ryan, for US$4.3m worth of shares, at about US$622 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$826, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was just 26% of Arthur Ryan's stake. Arthur Ryan was the only individual insider to sell shares in the last twelve months.The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year.

We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals insiders own about US$3.7b worth of shares (which is 4.2% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Insider Transactions Indicate?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Regeneron Pharmaceuticals shares in the last quarter. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals insiders selling.

With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP).Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. Check out our latest analysis for Union Pacific How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Union Pacific is:58% = US$7.0b ÷ US$12b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.58 in profit.Does Union Pacific Have A Good ROE?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Union Pacific has a superior ROE than the average (26%) in the Transportation industry.roeThat is a good sign. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesUnion Pacific's Debt And Its 58% ROEUnion Pacific does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 2.72. While no doubt that its ROE is impressive, we would have been even more impressed had the company achieved this with lower debt. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.ConclusionReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

612,3a37719a-b963-30bb-9071-b8fc9b23533a,UNP,2023-04-05,Union Pacific sued after firing rail worker on medical leave,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/union-pacific-sued-firing-rail-201100528.html,1680552660,STORY,['UNP'],"[OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Union Pacific routinely hires private investigators to check out employees' medical leave claims and then fires anyone who happens to leave their house while out on leave, according to a lawsuit filed against the railroad.The lawyer who last month filed one of the first lawsuits in a case like this in Texas said this practice is another example of how the railroads keep the pressure on train crews to remain on call 24-7 while making them afraid to take unpaid time off they're supposed to get under the Family Medical Leave Act.Now that the Texas case is moving forward in the courts, the lawyer, Nick Thompson, said he plans to look into the claims of several other UP employees who have contacted him with similar concerns that could turn into additional lawsuits.“Ultimately, this has the effect Union Pacific wants: It scares people from using FMLA,” Thompson said.Omaha, Nebraska-based Union Pacific says it didn’t do anything wrong when it fired De’Ron Rutledge because railroad managers believed he was abusing the medical leave rules by repeatedly taking time off as he was recovering from a back injury he suffered on the job. Spokeswoman Robynn Tysver said UP follows all the rules for providing Family Medical Leave Act time off.“We encourage eligible employees to use FMLA if they or their family member has a serious medical condition that qualifies under the law,” Tysver said. “We expect our employees to properly utilize this approved leave. If we learn that an employee is misusing FMLA, Union Pacific may take disciplinary action, as permitted under the law.”This whole situation might be less of a problem if employees had paid sick time, but the railroads have only started to address that concern in recent months through agreements giving some of their unions four days of paid sick time. But so far, most of the conductors and all of the engineers who work in locomotives — representing more than half of all rail workers — still don't have sick time. And those train crews have the most-demanding, unpredictable schedules.Story continues“I just don’t think it’s reasonable to have people on call 24-7, 365 days a year, including holidays and give them no sick days,"" Thompson said.The longstanding lack of paid sick time in the industry was a key issue that helped push railroads to the brink of a strike last fall before Congress intervened to block a walkout and force workers to accept a deal.Railroads might be less likely to be this aggressive enforcing medical leave rules if they weren't so short on employees. The shortage led railroads to acknowledge struggling over the past year to handle all the shipments many companies want them to deliver.Collectively the major freight railroads eliminated nearly one-third of their jobs over the past six years as they stripped down their operations to rely on fewer and longer trains so they wouldn't need as many employees or locomotives to run them. The railroads have been hiring aggressively since the height of their service problems last spring but they've had a hard time finding all the workers they need.“Hiring more people is expensive. Mistreating the employees you have costs nothing,” said Thompson, whose Wisconsin-based firm handles many complaints from railroad employees nationwide.Several other major freight railroads, including CSX and Norfolk Southern, have faced other lawsuits over the way they administer the federal Family Medical Leave Act.In the Texas case, Rutledge had worked various jobs at Union Pacific over 11 years leading up to working as a conductor before he was fired last year. According to his lawsuit, Rutledge had to take eight months off work to rehabilitate after the back injury in 2017 but after returning to the job he would occasionally need to take additional time off when his back condition flared up.But the railroad fired him after a private investigator saw Rutledge drive to the grocery store and gas station near his home in Fresno, Texas, and walk for short periods. And Rutledge said his bosses wouldn't listen when he tried to explain that even if he was well enough to run a few errands he didn't feel up to helping operate a train.“The fact that you’re on FMLA doesn’t mean that you have to lay in bed all day. The fact that you can’t work a 12-hour shift is different than whether you can do other things,"" Thompson said.Union Pacific is one of the nation's largest railroads operating trains across 23 Western states.To Thompson, both this lawsuit and the recent string of high-profile derailments are symptoms of the same thing employees and their lawyers have been saying for several years:“Railroads are putting profit ahead of everything — ahead of safety, ahead of employee well being — and we're seeing the results of that,"" he said.___This story has been updated to correct that most conductors have not, rather than have, received paid sick time leave.]"

This makes the dividend yield 2.0%, which is above the industry average. View our latest analysis for Quest Diagnostics Quest Diagnostics' Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWhile it is great to have a strong dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is sustainable. Before making this announcement, Quest Diagnostics was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 13.1%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 30% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendQuest Diagnostics Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $0.68, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $2.84. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 15% a year over that time. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.We Could See Quest Diagnostics' Dividend GrowingThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. It's encouraging to see that Quest Diagnostics has been growing its earnings per share at 8.6% a year over the past five years. Quest Diagnostics definitely has the potential to grow its dividend in the future with earnings on an uptrend and a low payout ratio.Quest Diagnostics Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

Six out of 10 (61%) within this age group feel good about their finances, according to new research from Ameriprise Financial. Among millennials who work with a financial professional, three-quarters (76%) feel good about where they stand financially.But that’s not to say they’re carefree. Nine out of 10 (90%) of those surveyed by Ameriprise say they are concerned about inflation, and eight out of 10 (80%) are worried about interest rates.They’re also in a busy season of life, often juggling careers, families and other responsibilities. More than half of millennials (56%) report feeling the pressure of balancing multiple financial priorities, which is markedly higher than older generations. Only 38% of Gen Xers and 23% of boomers said managing competing priorities is difficult.Despite the complexities, most millennials think they are faring well relative to their age cohort. Nearly six in 10 (58%) say they believe they are doing better financially compared to their peers.The study also uncovered:Millennials’ financial priorities differ from previous generations. Over half of millennials said one of their top three money goals is ""increasing my income"" (54%) followed by ""paying down debt"" (42%). In comparison, 66% of Gen Xers surveyed said ""saving for retirement"" was their top goal, and boomers reported that ""protecting accumulated wealth"" (55%) is their No. 1 priority.They have received significant financial help from family – and many expect additional assistance in the future. Seventy-eight percent of millennials reported receiving money – including inheritances, college funds, and down payments on a car or home – from family members. Among those who recall the amount, more than a quarter (27%) of millennials said they received $25,000 or more. And surprisingly, 41% of millennials expect to receive financial help in the future. Comparatively, 24% of Gen Xers and 5% of boomers expect family members to contribute to their financial well-being down the road.Story continues""Most millennials are in their 30s and 40s, and their lives – including their finances – are busier and more complex than ever,"" said Marcy Keckler, Senior Vice President of Financial Advice Strategy at Ameriprise. ""They’ve lived through major events in history and weathered the ups and downs of various economic cycles, which has informed their worldview and given them confidence that they will be able to tackle whatever the future holds.""But Keckler added a word of caution, noting that those who expect to receive financial assistance from family should have a Plan B in case the gifts don’t come through or match their expectations in terms of size or timing. ""Just as curve balls have been thrown at millennials in the past, the future will no doubt be full of surprises. The best thing investors of any age can do is to take control of what they can, and work toward their immediate and long-term goals with the help of a professional who can advise them along the way.""What keeps investors in their 30s and 40s up at night?Despite their overall confidence, the Ameriprise study shows millennials may be losing sleep as they work to balance competing priorities for their time and money. Among their top concerns:Continued economic uncertainty. Investors in this cohort are worried about global issues affecting their financial situation over the next year. An overwhelming majority (90%) say they are very or somewhat concerned about high inflation, tax increases (84%), a recession (83%), and high interest rates (80%). These macroeconomic issues may be undercutting their outlook on their personal finances. When asked to rank their top financial fears, 23% said ""not being able to provide for my family,"" 15% said ""losing my job"" and 12% said ""not having enough money to retire.""The burden of debt. As they take on more life responsibilities, millennials are feeling the strain of debt. The study found eight in ten (81%) millennial investors have debt and more than half of them (57%) report it is impacting their ability to achieve other goals. Among millennials with some form of debt, 62% have credit card debt and 32% have student loans. Additionally, nearly one in five (18%) have some form of medical debt.Necessity of securing their own retirement. The study reported only 29% of millennials have access to a pension compared to 48% of Gen X and 64% of boomers – a stark reminder that the retirement landscape has shifted over the decades, putting the onus on investors to save for their own retirements versus relying on funds from their employers. And although they have several decades before retirement, only one-quarter (27%) of millennials believe it’s completely realistic they will be able to retire at their chosen time.On a positive note, the study showed millennials are taking the responsibility to save for retirement seriously. Their generation started retirement investing earlier than older generations at a median age of 25 (compared to age 28 for Gen X and 30 for boomers), and one-third (36%) of millennials are already receiving passive income from sources including dividends, rental income, and royalties.""Millennials today are in the intense yet rewarding period in life when it’s common to be trying to make progress toward multiple important priorities all at once,"" added Keckler. ""Rather than letting their circumstances overwhelm them, millennials should know that no matter where they are along their individual financial journeys, there are ways they can feel more confident and in control.""Steps investors can take to further bolster their financesThe Ameriprise research unveils three steps millennials can take to capitalize on their success so far and continue making progress toward their goals:Act to withstand current economic conditions: Nearly all millennials (95%) surveyed say they have taken action to weather the present economic circumstances. Sixty percent report spending less and 48% say they are saving more.Take friends’ advice with a grain of salt. Nearly a quarter of millennials surveyed (22%) say they have sought advice from family members or friends. While this could be helpful, in reality, taking financial advice from an unqualified source could be costly. In fact, 37% of millennials who received bad financial advice from someone and acted on it said the tip came from a friend.Consider the tax treatment of retirement assets: The Ameriprise survey shows millennials may be disproportionately missing key opportunities to save on their tax bill. Fewer than three in ten millennials (28%) consider tax diversification when investing for retirement, and more than one-quarter (27%) of millennials do not know the tax treatment of their investment accounts. This lack of awareness could cost millennials money-saving tax breaks and even result in penalties (contribution limits for certain retirement accounts depend on income) if they’re not careful.""Now is the time for millennials to crystalize their long-term financial goals,"" said Keckler. ""Instead of relying on well-meaning friends, take the next milestone step of consulting a seasoned financial advisor for qualified advice specific to your unique circumstances.""About the surveyThe 2023 research was created by Ameriprise Financial Inc. and conducted online by Artemis Strategy Group from January 19 to February 14, 2023 among 3,518 Americans ages 27–77. Millennial respondents have $25,000 or more in investable assets, and Gen X and boomer respondents have $100,000 or more. The sample is weighted on region and by generation on age, gender, race/ethnicity, assets, and income based on the Federal Reserve 2021 Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking (SHED). To ensure sufficient response sizes for additional analysis, Ameriprise oversampled investors who identify as millennials.

Grainger GWW, Ameriprise Financial AMP, Agilent Technologies A and Bloomin’ Brands BLMN.4 GARP Stocks to Scoop Up for Maximum ReturnsGrowth at a reasonable price, or GARP, is an excellent strategy to earn quick investment profits. The GARP approach helps identify stocks priced below the market or any suitable target determined by fundamental analysis.The strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks with impressive prospects and trading at a discount. GARP stocks have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and others.Therefore, a portfolio based on the GARP strategy contains stocks that offer the best value and growth investing. W.W. Grainger, Ameriprise Financial, Agilent Technologies and Bloomin’ Brands are some GARP stocks that hold promise.GARP Metrics — Mix of Growth &amp; Value MetricsThe GARP strategy seeks to offer an ideal investment by utilizing the best features of value and growth investing. Investors adopting the GARP approach will prefer buying stocks priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. The stocks have solid prospects regarding cash flow, revenues, EPS and others.Growth MetricsA strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a tactic of GARP investors. Growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.Another growth metric considered by growth and GARP investors is the return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE than the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with a positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Story continuesValue MetricsGARP investing prioritizes one of the popular value metrics — the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though the investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios than value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. The price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is also considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Here are four of the six stocks that made it through the screen:W.W.

619,6a1ccbaf-c63c-3dc8-8662-402887f6bb86,CSCO,2023-04-05,"Is Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) Trading At A 29% Discount?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-systems-inc-nasdaq-csco-110044778.html,1680692444,STORY,['CSCO'],"[Key InsightsThe projected fair value for Cisco Systems is US$73.09 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityCurrent share price of US$51.82 suggests Cisco Systems is potentially 29% undervalued Analyst price target for CSCO is US$57.95 which is 21% below our fair value estimateIn this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Cisco Systems Is Cisco Systems Fairly Valued?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$15.7bUS$17.4bUS$17.6bUS$18.6bUS$19.5bUS$20.2bUS$20.8bUS$21.3bUS$21.9bUS$22.4bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x8Analyst x6Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 3.38%Est @ 2.98%Est @ 2.71%Est @ 2.52%Est @ 2.38% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.1% US$14.5kUS$14.9kUS$13.9kUS$13.6kUS$13.2kUS$12.6kUS$12.0kUS$11.4kUS$10.8kUS$10.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$127bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$22b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.1%– 2.1%) = US$377bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$377b÷ ( 1 + 8.1%)10= US$172bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$299b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$51.8, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 29% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Cisco Systems as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.021. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Cisco SystemsStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Communications market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Cisco Systems, we've put together three further elements you should look at:Risks: Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Cisco Systems   you should know about.Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for CSCO's future outlook?

Great Place to Work CEO Michael Bush, our partner in preparing this list, notes in his opening essay that the companies on this year’s list saw an eye-popping 7% year-over-year increase in revenue per employee—productivity growth that dwarfs the averages. Says Bush: “Companies that care for their people and prioritize their well-being…outperform.”Top of this year’s list is Cisco, for the third year in a row. That’s no small accomplishment. The employee surveys we rely on for this ranking were largely done last year before Cisco and several other companies on the list (including #4 Accenture and #8 Salesforce) announced layoffs. It will be interesting to see if their rankings take a hit next year as a result. But even the best businesses have to make difficult decisions. And Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins told Fortune’s Susie Gharib that how you do it matters.  “Nobody likes it. I don’t like it. It’s the worst thing we ever have to do,” Robbins said. He says Cisco tried to redeploy workers where possible, and “we were just honest about why we had to do it.”Also out this morning is a new episode of our podcast Leadership Next, featuring Occidental Petroleum CEO Vicki Hollub, who not only talks about why she thinks direct air capture technology can help solve the climate crisis, but also how she never imagined becoming CEO until a year before it happened.And a transition worthy of note. The amazing Ellen McGirt, who has been my partner on Leadership Next for these last three years, is taking a break from our podcast to focus on some other projects. She has been the yin to my yang in these interviews, helping to make sure we view the business world from all angles, and I will miss her. But the good news is that Fortune Editor-at-Large Michal Lev-Ram is stepping in to take her place. Big shoes to fill, and an amazing talent to fill them. Michal and I also promise to bring back Ellen for guest appearances frequently!Story continuesBy the way, Ellen has a great piece in the new issue of Fortune magazine, which you can read this morning here.Other news below.Alan Murray@alansmurrayalan.murray@fortune.comThis story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeExpert advice to keep your money safe during bank failuresThe young creators of a ""TED meets Burning Man"" conference bought a $40-million mountain.

622,22e431ca-97a0-3bfb-80b3-a22818b9a781,CSCO,2023-04-05,Cisco’s CEO says communication is key to leading the ‘Best Company’ through the ‘worst thing’,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-ceo-says-communication-key-110000201.html,1680606000,STORY,['CSCO'],"[What does it take to run the Best Company to Work For? Ask Chuck Robbins, CEO of Cisco Systems, and you will get a pretty standard answer: Communication is key.“We communicate very honestly, openly, transparently, and authentically,” he says. “And we talk to our employees about any of the issues that they want to talk about. [That’s] really important today because employees want to work for human beings.”That may sound like a common C-suite spiel, but when Cisco workers reviewed their employer, they too cited communication as one of the tech giant’s top traits. An internal platform called Team Space lets individuals and teams collaborate and ask questions of company leaders. An event series called Cisco Check-Ins attracted 59,000 unique employee views across 13 events during the company’s last fiscal year. During the check-in sessions, leaders share information about employee relations concerns, and workers give feedback on what’s working—and what’s not.Those forums, along with Cisco’s sustainability efforts, mental health resources, internal hiring, and community outreach, landed the San Francisco–based tech giant that sells networking and telecom hardware at No. 1 on Fortune’s Best Companies to Work For list for the third straight year.“Employees today care deeply about what the organization they work for stands for. They care about our purpose and what we believe in. And our purpose as a company is to power an inclusive future for all,” says Robbins.Fortune’s list is based on employee surveys conducted in mid-2022. Since then, Cisco, like so many of its tech industry peers, initiated layoffs, reducing its headcount by approximately 5%, or around 4,800. Can a company that lays off workers still be considered a top employer? Robbins argues that even the best businesses have to make difficult decisions. They can still do good by their employees by making sure those tough choices are communicated clearly and carried out thoughtfully.Story continues“Nobody likes it. I don’t like it. It’s the worst thing we ever have to do,” Robbins says of job cuts. The point of Cisco’s layoffs was to reallocate resources to areas of growth, and Robbins says the company tried its best to redeploy workers to “areas we wanted to invest in” before slashing positions. “Our employees really appreciated that,” he says. What do you say to the people that were laid off? “We were just honest about why we had to do it.”Robbins, 57, became Cisco CEO in 2015, when the company was arguably best known for its Internet routers and switches, office phone networks, and WebEx video chat platform. Robbins has steered Cisco toward growing areas like cybersecurity and the Internet of Things.In its most recent earnings for the three-month period ended Jan. 28, Cisco delivered better than expected results and raised its full-year outlook, buoyed by a robust public sector business and easing supply constraints. Quarterly revenue grew 7% year over year to $13.59 billion, though net income fell 7% to $2.77 billion.Robbins attributes Cisco’s upbeat forecast of 9% to 10.5% revenue growth for this fiscal year, in part, to its ongoing efforts to shift its business to more of a recurring model.“Now, 44% of our revenue is coming from recurring sources like software subscriptions,” he says. Amid economic turmoil, Cisco customers are being more diligent about their tech investments but still “understand the strategic value,” Robbins says. “We see some customers who are requiring more signatures, but in general, the signatures come, it just takes a little more time.”On a Monday in March, Robbins tours Cisco’s new 58,000-square-foot offices in Manhattan that opened in April 2022. The sleek, smart building is powered by Cisco technology, aims to minimize emissions, and features spaces where workers can collaborate. Robbins is especially proud of the office’s automated, energy-saving HVAC system. “If a room is empty for two hours, cooling goes off, and then 15 minutes before the next meeting, it’ll crank back up again. A lot of the integration is just really well thought-out,” he says.Despite the lavish space, Cisco is not requiring employees to return to the office, with some exceptions. Some teams with engineers, for instance, are encouraged to come in three days a week.“I used the phrase once: ‘Let’s make the office a magnet instead of a mandate,’ ” Robbins says. “We’re really trying to create spaces and environments that employees want to come spend time in and that they feel safe in; where they feel like they can collaborate with their peers; that feel modern.” Cisco is planning to refurbish some of its other offices and relocate several of its underutilized offices to areas where they’ll get more employee foot traffic.Perhaps gathering more employees under one roof will foster the kind of communication that Robbins—and Cisco employees—seem to cherish. Robbins recognizes that the issues that come up in the workplace now may be different than what employees and management discussed before.“We’ve always been honest, but the [range] of the topics that we’re willing to actually talk to our employees about has changed significantly. The number of things in the world that CEOs are expected to speak on has changed very dramatically,” he says.Still, Robbins says he’s up for any subject matter directed his way. “I joke with our employees that I’ll answer any question you have, if it doesn’t put one of us in jail or put the company at risk. I think it’s just important to set the tone from the top on how we’re going to operate as an organization.”Additional reporting by Megan Leonhardt.This article appears in the April/May 2023 issue of Fortune with the headline, “Leading the 'Best Company' through the 'worst thing.'”This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeExpert advice to keep your money safe during bank failuresThe young creators of a ""TED meets Burning Man"" conference bought a $40-million mountain.
