Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Range Resources as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.233. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

In value investing, investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound. There are a number of ratios to identify value stocks but none alone can conclusively determine their inherent potential. Each ratio helps an investor understand a particular aspect of the company’s business.', 'One such ratio, Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF), can work wonders in stock picking if used prudently. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis — the lower the number, the better. Adtalem Global Education Inc., General Motors Co., Unum Group and KB Home boast a low P/CF ratio.', 'You must be wondering why we are considering this when the most widely used valuation metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, an important factor that makes P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing a company’s financial health.', 'Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. Then again, cash flow is quite reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company generates and how effectively management is deploying the same.', 'A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company’s liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, meet its expenses, reinvest in the business, endure downturns and finally undertake shareholder-friendly moves. Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which, in turn, lowers its flexibility to support these endeavors.', 'However, an investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and take into account the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chances of falling into a value trap.', 'Here are four of the 15 stocks that qualified the screening:', 'Adtalem Global Education, a national leader in post-secondary education and a leading provider of professional talent to the healthcare industry, sports a Zacks Rank #1 currently.

In value investing, investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound. There are a number of ratios to identify value stocks but none alone can conclusively determine their inherent potential. Each ratio helps an investor understand a particular aspect of the company’s business.One such ratio, Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF), can work wonders in stock picking if used prudently. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis — the lower the number, the better. Adtalem Global Education Inc. ATGE, General Motors Company GM, Unum Group UNM and KB Home KBH boast a low P/CF ratio.', 'You must be wondering why we are considering this when the most widely used valuation metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, an important factor that makes P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing a company’s financial health.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. Then again, cash flow is quite reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company generates and how effectively management is deploying the same.A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company’s liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, meet its expenses, reinvest in the business, endure downturns and finally undertake shareholder-friendly moves. Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which, in turn, lowers its flexibility to support these endeavors.However, an investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and take into account the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chances of falling into a value trap.', ""Here are the parameters for selecting true-value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to their peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. The PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospects.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are four of the 15 stocks that qualified the screening:Adtalem Global Education, a national leader in post-secondary education and a leading provider of professional talent to the healthcare industry, sports a Zacks Rank #1 currently.

There are a number of investment styles for finding great stocks at attractive values.', 'While considering valuation metrics, though price-to-earnings and price-to-sales are the first choices, the P/B ratio is also emerging as a convenient tool for identifying low-priced stocks that have high-growth prospects.', 'Price-to-book ratio or P/B ratio is essentially the ratio of stock price to book value, i.e., how much an investor needs to pay for each dollar of the book value of a stock. It is calculated by dividing the current closing price of the stock by the book value per share.', 'Here’s the formula for P/B ratio:', 'P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equity.', 'The P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks with high growth prospects. General Motors Company GM, Unum Group UNM, KB Home KBH, Qifu Technology QFIN and Affiliated Managers Group AMG are some such stocks.', 'Now, let us understand the concept of book value.', 'There are several ways by which book value can be defined.\xa0Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.', 'It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.', 'By comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.', 'A P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value or the stock is undervalued and, therefore, a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.', 'For example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.', 'But there is a warning. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.', 'Moreover, the P/B ratio is not without limitations. It is useful for businesses like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.', 'In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.', 'Price to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.', 'Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.', 'Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share — a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.', 'PEG less than 1: PEG links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects.', 'Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.', 'Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.', 'Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.', 'Value Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.', 'Here are five of the 13 picks that qualified the screening:', 'Headquartered in Detroit,\xa0General Motors is one of the world’s largest automakers.

The Company excludes these amounts because it deems them to be non-recurring or non-operational and believes that their exclusion (i) facilitates comparing the results being reported against past and future results by eliminating amounts that it believes are not comparable between periods, thereby permitting management to evaluate performance and investors to make decisions based on the ongoing operations of the Company, and (ii) assists investors in evaluating the effectiveness of the Company’s operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance. The Company believes that investors often look at ongoing operations of an enterprise as a measure of assessing performance. The Company uses its results excluding these amounts to evaluate its operating performance and to discuss its business with investment institutions, the Company’s Board of Directors and others. The Company’s results excluding the items described above are also the basis for certain incentive compensation calculations. The non-GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or superior to, the Company’s operating performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The information presented on a non-GAAP basis may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.', 'The following table presents the non-GAAP measures that are discussed in this release.

Walmart operates more than 10,500 stores and warehouse clubs across 19 countries and a wide range of e-commerce websites. Alibaba owns Taobao and Tmall, the two largest e-commerce marketplaces in China, several overseas marketplaces, and more than 300 brick-and-mortar supermarkets. Alibaba also owns China's largest cloud infrastructure platform."", ""But over the past five years, Walmart's stock has rallied 85% as Alibaba's stock plunged 50%. Let's see why the American retailer outperformed its Chinese peer by such a wide margin -- and if it's still the better overall investment."", ""Walmart was one of the few big box retailers that survived the retail apocalypse and kept pace with Amazon. Walmart remained relevant by upgrading its e-commerce and delivery capabilities, using its own brick-and-mortar stores to fulfill its online orders, and matching Amazon's prices and promotions."", ""Walmart also differentiated itself from competitors with a broad selection of private label products. It even rolled out its own Walmart+ subscription plan -- which offers free deliveries, discounts, and streaming video from Paramount+ -- to counter Amazon Prime, and it's in the process of buying the smart TV maker Vizio to challenge Amazon's Fire TV devices."", ""Walmart kept up with Costco Wholesale in the warehouse club market with its Sam's Club stores, and it expanded its overseas e-commerce presence by acquiring India's Flipkart and buying a stake in Alibaba's rival JD.com. All of those moves enabled Walmart to blossom as many of its industry peers withered."", ""In fiscal 2024 (which ended this past January), Walmart's revenue rose 6%, driven by its 5.6% comparable store sales (excluding fuel) growth in the U.S. and a 13.5% increase in its international sales. The company's adjusted earnings per share (EPS) grew 6%. Analysts expect its revenue and adjusted EPS to grow 4% and 6%, respectively, in fiscal 2025."", ""Based on those expectations, Walmart trades at a reasonable 26 times forward earnings and pays a forward dividend yield of 1.4%. That yield might seem low, but it's raised its payout annually for the past 51 consecutive years. It also bought back 17% of its shares over the past decade. All of those strengths make Walmart a great safe haven play."", ""Alibaba's growth was derailed by a mix of regulatory, competitive, and macro headwinds over the past three years. In 2021, China's antitrust regulators hit it with a record $2.75 billion fine and forced the company to end exclusive deals with merchants, limit aggressive promotional strategies, and seek the government's approval for any major acquisitions."", ""Those draconian restrictions eroded Alibaba's defenses against aggressive competitors like JD.com and PDD. China's economic slowdown, which was exacerbated by unpredictable COVID-19 lockdowns, added to that pressure. To make matters worse, Alibaba's cloud business struggled as companies reined in their software spending."", ""Meanwhile, U.S. regulators threatened to delist shares of Chinese companies that didn't comply with tighter auditing standards. Its CEO, Daniel Zhang, stepped down last year, and it split its business into six new units in hopes of spinning them off with fresh initial public offerings (IPOs). However, the company subsequently scrapped most of those IPO plans -- so it won't be able to raise a lot of cash through spin-offs as its sales growth slows down."", ""Alibaba's revenue only rose 2% in fiscal 2023 (which ended last March) as its adjusted earnings per American depositary receipt (ADR) grew 4%. But for fiscal 2024, analysts expect its revenue and earnings to grow 7% and 14%, respectively, as the stronger growth of its overseas marketplaces offsets its slower sales in China. Alibaba also expects its logistics subsidiary, Cainiao -- which it recently took full ownership of -- to drive its growth as it offers more of its services to third-party customers."", ""For fiscal 2025, analysts expect Alibaba's revenue and earnings to rise 8% and 1%, respectively. Those growth rates might seem anemic, but its stock looks dirt cheap at just 8 times forward earnings. It recently increased its current buyback authorization by $25 billion -- but it's only bought back about 1% of its shares over the past decade."", ""Walmart's stock looks more expensive, but the company isn't stuck in a hurricane of macro, competitive, and regulatory headwinds like Alibaba. Walmart could eventually shed its premium valuation as interest rates decline and investors pivot back toward growth stocks, but it's still a solid long-term investment.

Jeffrey's maintaining bullish on Target's renovation plans. Jeffrey's raising its price target on the stock to $205 from $195 as the healthy but cautious consumer is still spending. Let's bring in the analyst behind that call, a good friend of the show, Corey Tarlowe, who is the senior vice president of equity research over at Jefferies. Corey, good to see you here. Thanks for kicking off the second quarter with us. First, you got to take us into your thesis. What are you seeing at Target right now that gives you this optimism?"", ""COREY TARLOWE: Morning, and thanks so much for having me. So I think the most important thing to note here is that perhaps the tone around the health of the consumer in the US is changing. So I think for a good period of time, the narrative was the consumer is stretched, credit card balances are now over $1 trillion, she's prioritizing what she needs over what she wants."", ""But now I think what we're starting to see is with the moderation in inflation, maybe there's some normalization of mix now in the consumer's basket. So if she's going into a store with $100, and now things like fresh fish, dairy milk, eggs et cetera, some fruits and vegetables are lower in price, maybe that's freeing up some incremental dollars to buy general merchandise."", ""And so what we're starting to see now is an improvement in general merchandise in Target's business. And I think perhaps an improvement around tone for the broader consumer generally. So I think that these are some pretty bullish signs for Target and for the US consumer."", ""JARED BLIKRE: Well, you mentioned freeing up some cash here. What about for unit expansion, investing in the store in new locations? How do you see that playing out? And what's the strategy here?"", ""COREY TARLOWE: Sure. So Target has about 2,000 units today, and they're growing. So the company is going to be adding over the next 10 years an aggregate of 300 new units. A lot of them are going to be in this newer format. They're going to have integrations with beauty, partnerships with Apple, Disney, Levi's, et cetera to create excitement for the consumer. They'll have availability for Starbucks, same-day pickup."", 'So all of these things are likely to help to continue to drive traffic to Target stores, which should mean more customers, more benefits, greater sales, and even perhaps better margin too as people maybe go to the store and pick up Starbucks and then they add in some incremental apparel items, which by the way are higher margin.', ""So I think all of this bodes very well from a unit expansion standpoint, which tends to help drive sales. And one of the things that's really important to key in on here is retailers that are expanding units tend to also hold higher multiples as well. So it could be good for valuation ahead."", ""BRAD SMITH: Corey, you met with management from Target as well as Walmart. I mean, take us into the tone from both of these executive teams and what you're hearing from them right now."", 'COREY TARLOWE: Sure. So the tone overall is positive. I think starting grounding in my comments on the consumer being relatively healthier and more resilient than I think we had initially expected. But for Walmart, one thing I think that was particularly interesting was that for-- as I mentioned, inflation has been moderating.', ""But particularly for food, food inflation has been moderating. And private label, which is $100 billion plus business for Walmart is also deflationary. And specifically within private label, food and consumables private label is now running deflationary as well. So I think that this does bode really well for Walmart's private label business generally because it means that perhaps Walmart is going to be gaining more market share."", ""All the while, you're seeing more promotions or rollbacks on things like food and consumables, and these are vendor-funded. So rollbacks are up, I think, 50% in the fourth quarter. And these promotions are becoming more broad versus item-specific. So I think that, again, really does bode well for share gains for Walmart ahead.""]"

It's been about seven years since the last increase and Costco tends to increase these fees every five or six years. But the next one might not arrive in 2024. There are no concrete plans to push an increase through as of early March, management said in a conference call. Investors will be disappointed if another year passes without this key jolt to cash flow and earnings."", ""Costco's price-leadership selling approach is clear enough from its rock-bottom profitability metrics. Gross profit margin sits at just 12% of sales today, compared to closer to 25% of sales for both Walmart and Target. The warehouse giant is similarly at the bottom of the pack when it comes to operating profit margin, which hovers around just 3% of sales."", ""Investors might start demanding more from Costco in 2024 and beyond. Walmart is boosting its margins toward 5% of sales with help from a booming e-commerce segment. Costco is getting good growth from this niche as well, with recent hits including gold bars and gift cards. Wall Street is hoping that the retailer can meaningfully increase its profit margin, but it's likely Costco will continue pouring any excess cash right back into keeping its prices unbeatably low."", 'While customer traffic is a core metric to follow for most retailers, Costco investors have an even better one to judge its shopper engagement against: renewal rates. The chain has been steadily improving this rate, pushing deeper into record territory. A full 93% of members are renewing their subscriptions today, in fact.', ""There's a fight going on for these shoppers, though. Walmart said in its recent earnings call that some of its fastest growth is coming from higher-income customers in the grocery niche. Target is working hard to build back its consumer discretionary business after it slumped in the past year, too. If rivals make inroads in prying away some Costco customers, reducing its renewal rate in the process, then the stock could be punished in 2024."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Costco Wholesale right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Costco Wholesale, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Costco Wholesale wasn’t one of them.

The advertiser category is now Walmart Connect’s fastest-growing after spending on sponsored search grew by 63% last year.', 'At the same time, Walmart Connect is beginning to offer offsite media to a selection of non-endemic advertisers, or businesses that do not sell through Walmart. Those include automotive, entertainment, financial services, quick-service restaurant and travel companies.', 'Coming off a strong year, Walmart Connect is looking to widen the pool of its advertiser base. The unit is expanding the variety of programmatic ad products available to marketplace brands via its self-service platform, along with courting more non-endemic and international brands into the fold.', 'Self-service advertising can help retail media networks achieve greater scale, welcoming more small- and mid-sized advertisers that find managed services too pricey. Extending on-site display to marketplace sellers for the first time seeks to build on momentum in search, which has made the marketplace category Walmart Connect’s fastest-growing. The move also speaks to the increasing importance of programmatic in retail media. Lehrfeld said display ads on Walmart properties are becoming “primarily programmatic and auction based.”', 'Some scrutiny has been cast on retail media networks’ programmatic practices after reports that the sector runs a heavy amount of ads on Made for Advertising sites, or low-value clickbait farms. A wide-ranging report from Adalytics on the prevalence of MFAs found Walmart Connect did not transact on them.', 'Non-endemic advertising is another emergent competitive front for retail media networks that want to prove their first-party data know-how is valuable to brands that sell outside of their ecosystems. Walmart Connect is additionally rolling out localized self-service support tools and educational resources to help international brands reach customers in the U.S.', 'Walmart has made several moves to hone the appeal of its retail media network, which competes against other retailer offerings, such as Target’s Roundel, and Amazon for brand dollars. The big-box store in February acquired Vizio for $2.3 billion, a deal that includes the smart TV maker’s ad solutions and a rich set of data that many advertisers rely on for media planning and buying.', 'Walmart Connect is also broadening its in-store demo stations and sampling, part of a renewed focus on leveraging physical retail to support advertising. On that front, Walmart Connect said it is implementing in-store campaign management tools as a self-service capability, beginning with TV wall advertising.', 'Turning toward digital channels, Walmart Connect is making media partnerships with Roku and TikTok accessible to more advertisers following a pilot period. To help address signal loss, the group is deepening its targeting, conversion and measurement bench. In-store attribution for search campaigns and brand-term targeting in search are some of the ways Walmart Connect is trying to improve its sophistication in these areas.', 'Lastly, Walmart Connect is pushing to refine its creative tools to help marketers better realize their omnichannel efforts. The announcement teased more self-service offerings coming down the pike, including video additions, and a Creative Builder platform that applies machine learning to help brands develop and optimize creative assets for advertising.', 'Walmart Connect saw revenue up 22% in Q4, an important window that includes the holiday sales period.

The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.', 'Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.', 'Below, we take a look at Raymond James Financial, Inc. (RJF), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B.

Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 6.95% compares favorably with the industry's 3.61% performance as well."", 'While any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Raymond James Financial, Inc. Have risen 14.62%, and are up 37.69% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved 10.42% and 32.12%, respectively.', ""Investors should also pay attention to RJF's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. RJF is currently averaging 915,573 shares for the last 20 days."", 'Earnings Outlook', ""The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement.

The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years."", 'Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.', 'As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Raymond James Financial is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.', 'Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices', ""The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock."", ""For Raymond James Financial, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business.

Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating.

Production cuts implemented by OPEC+ and the ongoing consolidation in the Permian Basin are anticipated to create a bullish tone for oil price trajectories for the remainder of the year.', 'Yahoo Finance Senior Business Reporter Ines Ferré breaks down the details.', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith"", ""BRAD SMITH: Oil posting solid gains for the first quarter of the year, but demand side headwinds that might threaten the commodity this quarter.

I'll put up the chart there so you can see where oil prices are at. We have seen oil prices this year rally in the first three months of the year. WTI trading above $83 a barrel. Brent crude now trading around $87 a barrel. So we've had a strong quarter for oil."", ""OPEC will have a smaller online meeting this week. They're not expected to tamper with the production cuts that they've set so far. In June, they will have a broader, bigger meeting. And some traders are saying that you could see OPEC Plus really continuing on with their production cuts through the end of the year now. As some traders were expecting, perhaps June they would scale something back. But now it could be through the end of the year."", ""But as one oil trader put it to me, he said, look, history shows that when oil continues to be above $80 a barrel, OPEC tends to overproduce. I also do want to mention that I spoke to one analyst recently that told me that with this whole consolidation that you're seeing in the Permian Basin-- last year, you saw record production. You had smaller oil producers as well contributing to that production."", 'Well, when you have a consolidation, that kind of starts to set the tone for a controlled production, so to speak. So there is an expectation that production is going to be more controlled in the second half of this year. All of that is, of course, bullish for prices as we speak. And you are also looking at XLE that had an excellent month last month. And for the year, XLE up as well, guys.', ""BRAD SMITH: Yahoo Finance's very Ines Ferre. Ines, thanks so much.""]"

The Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, to which Morgan Stanley belongs, has gained 7.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?"", ""While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making."", 'Earnings Estimate Revisions', ""Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements."", 'For the current quarter, Morgan Stanley is expected to post earnings of $1.71 per share, indicating a change of +0.6% from the year-ago quarter.

Power companies that tap into the latest computer vision technology stand to benefit greatly. Infrastructure maintenance has proved to be one of the greatest challenges—and most costly expenses—for the utility industry. As risks grow, utilities companies increasingly seek out more efficient solutions for assessing and mitigating those risks. In particular, the emerging technology of computer vision—an application of artificial intelligence (AI)—is rising in prominence. It’s become of interest because it is such an efficient and cost-effective means for managing the growing burdens of asset inspection and asset maintenance.', 'Recent events have shown that insufficient maintenance of utility infrastructure can cause catastrophic damage to human lives, communities, and the environment. This, in turn, leads to costly consequences for those utility companies that are found liable for such losses. The prime example, of course, is Pacific Gas & Electric’s (PG&E’s) liabilities following a series of deadly California wildfires in 2017 and 2018 that killed 104 people. California government authorities found the fires were sparked by downed power lines and faulty electrical equipment. The findings concluded that these fires were fueled by improperly maintained vegetation around electrical equipment. PG&E has thus far agreed to settle multiple lawsuits for more than $14 billion in total, which prompted a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. The industry is facing a rising set of risks to utility infrastructure, and these will become more common with the mounting effects of climate change especially. Planning for extreme weather events is now commonplace, whether it be California droughts that fuel catastrophic wildfires, or hurricane or deep-freeze impacts on Texas power lines. It’s no longer just a matter of “if” they’ll occur, but a question of when, and how often. In addition, risks associated with the industry’s aging assets carry real costs. For example, California’s Camp Fire was sparked by nearly 100-year-old power lines that PG&E had acquired in 1930. The U.S. Department of Energy reported that 70% of power transformers and transmission lines are more than 25 years old. Companies are faced with tough choices: which assets to maintain, upgrade, or replace, based on their risk profiles. In the face of these challenges, inspection and maintenance become key priorities. However, these are traditionally labor-intensive tasks, and that is not good news when the industry faces historic labor shortages—another fundamental challenge. In the U.S., the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that the employment of electricians and other skilled laborers will need to increase by 10% between 2020 and 2030. This comes at a time when the current workforce is rapidly approaching retirement age, while younger generations are reluctant to enter the field to replace them. Labor shortages lead to delays in new construction projects, and a lack of resources and necessary experience to conduct critical inspection and maintenance work. As these and other interconnected risks and challenges increase, so do their associated costs. In the wake of the California wildfires and the resultant PG&E bankruptcy, other utility companies are shoring up their mitigation efforts. For example, since 2019, Xcel Energy in Colorado—another prime wildfire area—has invested nearly $500 million in mitigation costs alone. These efforts come at a time when utility companies have reported skyrocketing costs for liability insurance, along with a decline in the number of insurers and the addition of built-in wildfire exclusions. Meanwhile, on the labor front, companies are coming to grips with the fact that they must invest significantly in recruitment and training efforts. This has to happen along with offering competitive compensation packages and advancement prospects to attract and retain workers.', 'As such risks and challenges increase, the good news is that new technological advancements have also stepped in to help solve them. Recognizing the dire need for new solutions, the utility industry is increasingly investing in new technology. Executives see this as a way to assess and mitigate some of the utility’s major risks. One prime area of innovation is ripe with applications for the utility industry: the field of computer vision. As a key part of the fast-growing AI field, computer vision involves building systems that quickly obtain, analyze, and learn from information gathered from images, videos, or multi-dimensional data. It is the technology at the core of facial recognition, for example—the ability of your phone to take a photo, “see” a pattern of pixels, recognize that pattern as one that matches your own unique face, and then unlock your phone. How does it work? Imagine a photo taken of a power line in a forest (Figure 1). When humans look at the photo, our eyes take in shapes, colors, and countless other details, and send this information to our brains. Our brains have evolved over millennia to instantly recognize patterns, turning them into meaning without having to think about it. We look at the photo and see every tree, branch, bush, and the power line. We might even focus in on a particular tree branch to see if looks to be hanging low to the power line.', '1. A view of Stanislaus National Forest from the “Rim of the World” turnout area on the side of California State Route 120. Source: Creative Commons / King of Hearts', 'For a computer, though, the photo begins as just a series of pixels—assorted strings of data. To “see” an image, computer vision relies on machine learning and neural networks. Machine learning (or deep learning) involves building algorithms and models that allow a computer to teach itself to recognize and see what it needs to see. Over time, the network’s predictions—that is, the prediction that a certain shape corresponds with an object it wants to identify—become increasingly accurate. Massive amounts of data are needed for this kind of learning, however. The computer must be fed image after image of forests and power lines in order for it to eventually be able to distinguish between a power line and a tree (let alone to “see” and assess small details like a single branch’s proximity to a line). These feats, while powerful, were not widely available in the commercial arena until recently. Roadblocks to their adoption included the computing power needed to store and analyze the vast quantity of data collected from video and images, as well as the need for engineers with the expertise to create, train, and deploy the machine learning models and neural networks involved. However, thanks to cloud-related cost savings, the technology is now entirely cost-effective. Rather than hosting the supercomputers themselves, companies can partner with cloud-based computing services to store their data, along with taking advantage of an increasing number of pre-built deep-learning vision models and platforms available from providers. Furthermore, computer vision’s cost-effectiveness increases profoundly when its applications can mitigate the costs of the challenges it is helping to solve. We’re seeing this now in the utility industry in a number of applications, including those described below.', 'Computer vision can be harnessed through various means in the utility industry. It’s already being used in interesting ways, especially when combined with other rapidly advancing technologies, such as autonomous robots and unmanned aircraft systems—that is, drones. One example is the deployment of drones to aid with nuclear power inspections. Nuclear utilities have used drones to access and inspect areas where safety may be a risk for a human inspector, or that are otherwise hard to reach. Drones can inspect construction activities, concrete structures, hard-to-reach components, storage systems, radiation mapping, and more. Computer vision enters the picture to analyze the images collected; otherwise, a human would have to manually review every minute of footage collected. One technology company developed machine learning models to assist utilities in automatically detecting defects in their concrete containment structures. Using this tool, nuclear utilities can deploy drones to conduct inspections of the structures, upload their image datasets, and then use machine learning models to evaluate and review the results. Another example of the technology’s use can be found in the solar power industry. For instance, Genium, a Silicon Valley–based software and engineering service company, has developed a solution called SolarScan. It combines data collection, processing, and analysis to streamline and improve the solar panel inspection process. For example, one large European utility company expanded its renewable energy sources to include a large solar field in Africa. In order to achieve optimal performance at these solar panel assets, the field must be regularly inspected. Many kinds of obstructions (such as sand, dirt, bird droppings, and debris) can prevent optimal performance or even cause lasting damage. However, such inspections are labor- and time-intensive, all of which is complicated by their geographic distance from the parent company. Genium’s solution involves deploying drones, such as Parrot’s Anafi model, to collect RGB (red-green-blue) and radiometric images of solar panels. When combined with information from a solar utility’s existing voltage and amperage sensors, the data collected is aggregated and processed through the cloud. Then, using computer vision learning models that are able to learn and recognize anomalies, the system efficiently detects equipment, system, environmental, and other issues. These range from shorted circuits to soiled panels to vegetation overgrowth and more (Figure 2). Finally, the system generates detailed reports and notifies a technician—who then uses customized maintenance tools and dashboards to determine exactly where the problem lies, and how and when to prioritize it.', '2. Example of a solar panel field image captured by a drone and analyzed with computer vision to detect potential anomalies (captured in red and yellow). Courtesy: Genium', 'The result is significant gains in efficiency and cost savings. “By identifying anomalies and issues in real-time, SolarScan allows for proactive maintenance that is targeted to areas of high risk,” said Alex Iceman, founder and CEO of Genium. “This approach helps prevent potential downtime, reduces the amount of inspection resources necessary, lowers repair costs, and extends the lifetime of solar panel assets.”', 'There are clearly many concrete benefits for using computer vision applications to assess and mitigate risks in utility infrastructure. However, some areas of the industry are moving slower than others to adopt these solutions, for a variety of reasons. First, these approaches are not yet mandated by government regulators or insurance companies. Thus, utility companies must pursue them of their own accord. While major well-established utility companies may not be ready to scale a computer vision-based inspection solution across their entire system, smaller pilot programs help to demonstrate their effectiveness in the shorter term. Further, there are preconceived notions of the costs, risks, and benefits to such approaches, but these barriers may no longer apply. It is important to note that technology is advancing rapidly, which means the landscape has changed significantly in a short amount of time. For example, compared to just a few years ago, the costs of drones have plummeted while their capabilities (including range, speed, communications, and more) have swiftly improved. Similarly, with the use of cost-efficient cloud-based solutions, the analytical capabilities of AI and computer vision technology are increasing exponentially. This, in turn, can save millions of dollars in human inspection costs. Genium’s Iceman put it this way: “Today, we are standing on a precipice of unprecedented technological innovation. AI and computer vision tech is poised to take us in directions we can barely imagine. The utility industry is in the early stages of using AI and computer vision solutions and already finding it’s helping to mitigate some big risks.”', '—Gordon Feller (@GordonFeller on X) is a leading advisor on energy futures and provides insights to top executives at many of the world’s leading organizations.

He recently commented on the company's unbundling of one of its more controversial pieces of software, reiterating his bullish stance on Microsoft's prospects."", ""Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss made his pronouncements on April Fool's Day, but they weren't meant to make anyone look foolish. The analyst stood by his overweight (buy, in other words) rating on Microsoft at a price target of $465 per share. That's roughly 9.5% higher than the shares' current level."", 'Weiss felt compelled to write an update on Microsoft because there was some potential stock price-moving news about the monster tech company. It said on Monday that it will sell its Teams messaging and conferencing program separately from its popular Office productivity suite worldwide.', 'The announcement comes six months after it enacted this unbundling on the European market.', ""This was Microsoft's apparent move to head off an investigation on the packaging of the two by the European Commission -- the executive arm of the European Union (EU) that wields certain regulatory powers. The Commission was concerned that, if sold together, the bundled programs would stifle competition (Teams is similar in functionality and overall look to Salesforce's popular Slack program)."", 'In Weiss\'s view, the unbundling will result in ""no meaningful change,"" to Microsoft\'s Office business and, hence, it will not affect the company\'s overall trajectory.', 'I buy this argument, and I think the analyst is actually being conservative with his price target.

Since the start of 2023, it has risen an amazing 520%. However, that's not surprising for a cyclical company like Nvidia."", ""Nvidia sells a product once and then must sell another to continue driving sales. This can lead to a boom-or-bust environment. While this has worked for many companies for hundreds of years, it's not as repeatable as a subscription model."", ""So if you're looking for stocks for the long term, consider these three that are riding the same wave as Nvidia."", ""Some of Nvidia's largest customers are those who own data centers used for cloud computing. Cloud computing is used by many companies that don't wish to maintain computing resources within the company. It involves renting computing power from cloud computing providers, which converts large upfront capital costs into recurring expenses. This is smart, as it keeps a business's capital light, allows it to scale easily, and doesn't come with the risk of buying technology that could be obsolete in a few years."", ""The largest cloud computing providers are Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), and they are massive buyers of Nvidia's primary product: graphics processing units (GPUs). Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet build massive data centers with computing power for their cloud computing clients. GPUs provide a lot of computing power in these data centers, as they can be utilized to crunch data, run engineering simulations, and train artificial intelligence (AI) models."", ""The use of GPUs for AI has recently sparked a lot of interest, as many companies are racing to develop and implement their AI models. This has caused a demand spike for Nvidia (for its GPUs) and the cloud computing providers (their easily rentable resources). The primary difference here is that Nvidia may sell its GPUs to one of the cloud computing providers or another end-user, but that's it. Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet charge their customers a monthly fee to utilize their resources."", ""This is key, as Nvidia has to hope the demand for its products keeps up; otherwise, its business could come crashing down. While I'm not saying that will happen soon for Nvidia, it has tended to get wrapped up in various bubbles (most recently, the cryptocurrency bust in 2018 and 2021) and end up with a vast supply of unwanted GPUs. This may happen again for AI-centric GPUs, or it may not."", ""As an illustration of Nvidia's cyclical nature, take a look at this graph, which shows how far its quarterly revenue declined from a previous high. (Note: The end value in the chart is 0% because they are currently all at their highest quarterly revenue of all time)."", 'Because Nvidia is prone to rising and falling demand, its revenue drops from its highs are much larger than those of Amazon, Microsoft, or Alphabet.', ""Regardless, it's much less certain than cloud computing, which is expected to massively grow. Grand View Research issued a report that stated the cloud computing market size was around $484 billion in 2022. But it expects it to massively increase to $1.55 trillion by 2030. That's a huge growing industry, and Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet are all set to capitalize on the growth."", 'Still, Nvidia will benefit from the buildout of data centers to run cloud computing. But once that initial sale is complete, the company will lose out on further revenue.', ""If you're curious about why subscriptions are better than one-time purchases, just look at the software industry."", ""Software companies figured out about a decade ago that locking clients into a subscription service is a much better business model. Clients have to make a painful choice if they break the subscription, as they'll lose access to the software altogether. Before this, customers could choose to upgrade to the newest software edition, which may include some new features. But it wasn't always required."", ""Now, nearly all software is subscription-based, and even basic products like Microsoft's Office suite have a subscription offering. Clearly, this business model has some advantages over a single sale."", ""While Nvidia may be fine, I'm more confident in Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet's ability to sustain their businesses over the long term due to their cloud computing segments. While these aren't the largest parts of their businesses, they are critical components that will provide consistent subscription revenue."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

However, Amazon generates more revenue than all of them, and yet its stock is the cheapest of the bunch.

It offers hundreds of solutions to help businesses store data, operate digital sales channels, develop software, and build AI applications. Amazon's goal is to have AWS dominate the three primary layers of AI."", ""The hardware layer comes first. Like most cloud providers, Amazon fills its data centers with Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) graphics processing units (GPUs), which are the most powerful in the industry when it comes to handling AI workloads."", 'However, Amazon also designs its own chips; it recently launched Trainium2, which is four times faster and twice as energy efficient as the original Trainium chip, allowing developers to train large language models (LLMs) far more quickly. LLMs sit at the foundation of popular consumer-facing applications like ChatGPT.', ""But some developers prefer to use existing LLMs so they can build AI applications more quickly. That's the second layer. AWS offers a variety of models, including its own called Titan and models from leading third parties like Anthropic, Meta Platforms, and Stability AI."", 'Ready-made applications are the third and final layer. AWS offers CodeWhisperer, which helps developers accelerate their programming. Then there is Amazon Q, a fully functional chatbot embedded in AWS. No two businesses are the same, so Q can be tailored to suit the tasks at hand to streamline projects, drive innovation, and speed up decision making.', 'In September 2023, Amazon and Anthropic announced a strategic partnership. Amazon would invest $4 billion in the start-up, of which the final $2.75 billion was transferred in March to close the deal. In exchange, Anthropic is helping Amazon accelerate penetration into the AI industry.', ""Anthropic is the creator of Claude, a generative AI chatbot. Its recent Claude 3 models reportedly outperformed competitors like OpenAI's GTP-4 models in most multimodal benchmarks. That means they are better at reasoning, solving math problems, answering complex questions, and generating content like computer code."", ""Anthropic will use AWS as its primary cloud provider. It will also train its future AI models on Amazon's chips, which could entice other leading developers to use them instead of Nvidia's hardware, which have become the default choice. Finally, Anthropic will make all of its models available on AWS for customers to use, which could be an advantage when developers are choosing a cloud provider."", ""Microsoft is the world's second-largest cloud provider, and it invested $10 billion in OpenAI last year. If Anthropic's Claude continues to outperform GPT-4, it could give Amazon and AWS the ultimate edge in the AI race."", 'Amazon generated $574 billion in revenue in 2023, which was more than any of its trillion-dollar peers. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) was the closest with $394 billion in sales during its fiscal 2023 year (ended Sept. 30, 2023).', ""Nevertheless, Amazon's market capitalization stands at $1.9 trillion, compared to Apple's $2.7 trillion. The price to sales (P/S) ratio divides a company's market cap by its annual revenue, so in this case Amazon's P/S ratio is 3.2."", 'As the below chart shows, Amazon stock is substantially cheaper than those of all of its trillion-dollar peers in the tech sector on a P/S basis, which includes Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet (Google).', ""Amazon's revenue grew by 12% in 2023, which was a faster rate of growth than Apple (2.8%) and Alphabet (9%), yet its stock trades at half their P/S ratio. Amazon generates less profit (relative to its revenue) because its e-commerce business operates on razor-thin margins, which is a key reason investors give it a lower valuation."", ""However, AWS specifically is highly profitable, with $24.6 billion in operating income on $90.7 billion in revenue last year. Here's the kicker: Most Wall Street forecasts suggest AI will have a multitrillion-dollar impact on the global economy. Plus, Cathie Wood's Ark Investment Management believes AI software companies will generate $14 trillion in revenue by 2030."", ""Therefore, AWS might be sitting on significant untapped potential. As it grows to become a larger contributor to Amazon's overall revenue, it will make the entire organization more profitable.

Wall Street’s bull run got an added boost this year, to the surprise of a large section of financial pandits, who indiscriminately warned of overvaluation. Now, the question is, next what? We believe that the bulls will continue to roar, supported by a robust U.S. economy.', 'U.S. GDP rose 2.5% in 2023 compared with a 1.9% rise in 2022. At the beginning of 2023, the consensus estimate for full-year GDP was 2%. On Mar 29, the Atlanta Fed GDPNow tracker forecast a 2.3% growth rate for first-quarter 2024, indicating no chance of a near-term recession. Moreover, the Fed raised the U.S. GDP forecast for 2024 to 2.1% in the March FOMC meeting from 1.4% in December 2023.', 'The core PCE inflation rate (excluding volatile food and energy items) — Fed’s favorite inflation gauge — rose 0.3% month over month in February compared with 0.5% in the previous month. Year over year, core PCE inflation rose 2.8% in February compared with 2.9% in January. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that the data was in line with the central bank’s expectations.', 'Peak inflation is far behind us. The labor market remains resilient. Moreover, personal consumption expenditure — the largest driver of the GDP — increased 0.8% month over month in February, compared with the consensus estimate of 0.5% and a 0.2% increase in January.', 'The ongoing tech rally since the beginning of 2023 was led by a massive thrust toward artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI. The rapid penetration of digital technologies and the Internet worldwide during the lockdown period, ushered in significant adoption of AI.', 'We believe the AI space is yet to unfold in the United States and international markets. Once that happens, it will generate huge business opportunities for technology companies producing high-end products.', 'Smart devices need computing and learning capabilities to perform face detection, image recognition and video analytics capabilities. These require high processing power, speed and memory, low power consumption, and better graphic processors and solutions, which bode well for the AI-powered semiconductor industry.', 'The first-quarter 2024 earnings season will kick off within two weeks. Wall Street is set to see a positive earnings season for three quarters in a row. Total S&P 500 earnings for the first quarter of 2024 are expected to be up 2.5% from the same period last year on 3.5% higher revenues.', 'This follows the 6.7% year-over-year earnings growth on 3.9% higher revenues in fourth-quarter 2023 and 3.8% year-over-year earnings growth on 2.1% higher revenues in third-quarter 2023.', 'On Mar 20, after the FOMC meeting, the Fed kept the benchmark lending rate constant in the range of 5.25-5.5%. The range of the Fed fund rate has been steady since July 2023.', 'However, the Fed’s latest “dot-plot” (a closely watched matrix of anonymous projections from the 19 officials who comprise the FOMC) shows the benchmark lending rate coming down to 4.625% at mid-point by the end of 2024. The existing mid-point of the Fed fund rate is 5.375%. This indicates three rate cuts of 25 basis points each.', 'Despite higher valuation, the tech rally is likely to gather more pace in 2024 as a low market rate of interest always boosts growth stocks like technology. We have narrowed our search to five technology behemoths (market capital > $100 billion) that have provided double-digit returns year to date. These companies have a robust business model, a solid financial position and globally acclaimed brand value.', 'These stocks have strong growth potential for 2024 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Finally, each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.', 'NVIDIA Corp.’s Compute & Networking revenues are gaining from the strong growth of AI, high-performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures.', 'A surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds for NVDA. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance NVDA’s presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.', 'Zacks Rank #1 NVIDIA has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 72.6% and 84%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025).

The stock price of NVDA has soared 82.5% year to date.', 'Meta Platforms Inc. is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement with its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. META is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook.', 'META’s innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2 and Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3, is likely to aid growth. Reels continue to do very well across Instagram and Facebook. People reshared Reels 3.5 billion times every day during the fourth quarter.', 'Zacks Rank #1 Meta Platforms has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 17.7% and 34.1%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.6% over the last 60 days. The stock price of META has climbed 37.2% year to date.', 'Micron Technology Inc. has enhanced its chip packages with AI, machine learning and deep learning. Using AI and analytics, MU has produced hardware with increased storage capacity, faster memory, and high-quality data filtering.', 'The expectation of supply normalization by mid-year 2024 is likely to drive pricing, while the boom in AI spending is expected to fuel demand for MU’s chips in the data center end market. Additionally, 5G adoption in the IoT devices and wireless infrastructure is likely to spur demand for MU’s memory and storage.', 'Zacks Rank #2 Micron Technology has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 55.6% and more than 100%, respectively, for the current year (ending August 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved more than 100% over the last 30 days. The stock price of MU has jumped 38.2% year to date.', 'Microsoft Corp. is riding on strong growth from Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes. Intelligent Cloud revenues are driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services. MSFT’s Productivity and Business Processes revenues continue to increase due to the strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions.', 'Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings, as well as a rise in revenue per user, are drivers of top-line growth. MSFT got off to an early lead in the generative AI race, thanks to its work with OpenAI. The general availability of Copilot for Security holds promises. We expect fiscal 2024 net sales to grow 14.6% from fiscal 2023.', 'Zacks Rank #2 Microsoft has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 15% and 18.6%, respectively, for the current year (ending June 2024).

The stock price of MSFT has rallied 11.9% year to date.', 'Amazon.com Inc. has benefited from Prime and AWS’ momentum. The strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate have contributed to the performance of AMZN. Ultrafast delivery services and an expanding content portfolio have been beneficial. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers have also favored the company. AMZN’s robust advertising business has contributed as well.', 'Notably, improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home product offerings continue to act as a tailwind. AMZN’s strong global presence and solid momentum among small and medium businesses remain positive.

However, artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to do for businesses in this generation what the internet did for corporate America three decades ago.', 'By the turn of the decade, analysts at PwC foresee AI, which relies on software and systems in place of human oversight, increasing global gross domestic product by $15.7 trillion. No company has more directly benefited from the AI revolution than semiconductor stock Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA).', ""Over the span of 15 months, Nvidia's valuation has soared by $1.9 trillion to $2.26 trillion, which ranks behind only Microsoft and Apple among publicly traded companies in the U.S."", ""Nvidia's outperformance is a reflection of the overwhelming demand for its high-powered A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs). Some analysts believe Nvidia's top-tier chips could account for more than 90% of the GPUs deployed in AI-accelerated data centers this year. The early stage scarcity associated with these chips has afforded Nvidia exceptional pricing power."", 'But there are also plenty of reasons to believe Nvidia is in a bubble.', ""For example, every next-big-thing trend and innovation over the last three decades has worked its way through an early stage bubble. Investors have a habit of overestimating the adoption of new technology, and I don't anticipate AI being the exception."", ""Nvidia is also likely to see its pricing power wane in the quarters to come as new competitors enter the space and the company's own production reduces the scarcity of AI-GPUs. The bulk of Nvidia's 217% data-center sales growth in fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28, 2024) can be traced to its pricing power."", 'The chief concern might just be that its top four customers, which are ""Magnificent Seven"" constituents and comprise roughly 40% of its sales, are all developing in-house AI chips for their data centers. One way or another, Nvidia\'s orders from its top customers are liable to taper off in the quarters to come.', ""If history rhymes, once more, and the AI bubble bursts, Nvidia's market cap could crater (in context to where it is now) and allow other companies to leapfrog it."", 'Here are five companies -- not including Microsoft and Apple, which are already ahead of Nvidia -- which have the tools and intangibles to be worth more than Nvidia three years from now.', ""The first industry titan that shouldn't have any trouble surpassing Nvidia's market cap over the coming three years is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), the parent company of internet search engine Google, streaming platform YouTube, and autonomous-driving company Waymo, among other ventures."", ""The reason Alphabet would hold up substantially better than Nvidia if the AI bubble bursts is because it's a veritable monopoly in internet search. In March, Google accounted for more than 91% of worldwide internet search share. Looking back through nine years of monthly data from GlobalStats, Google hasn't ceded more than 10% of global internet search share to all other companies, combined. It's the clear-and-obvious choice for advertisers looking to get their message in front of users, and it's going to benefit immensely from long periods of domestic and international growth."", ""Google Cloud can also thrive if Nvidia stumbles. Enterprise cloud spending is still in its early innings, and Google Cloud has gobbled up a 10% share of worldwide cloud infrastructure service share, as of September 2023. Since cloud margins are traditionally juicier than advertising margins, Alphabet's cash flow growth may accelerate in the latter-half of the decade."", 'Like Alphabet, e-commerce juggernaut Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) can jump back ahead of Nvidia at some point over the next three years if the AI bubble deflates.', ""Most people are familiar with Amazon because of its world-leading online marketplace. In 2023, an estimated 38% of online retail spending in the U.S. was traced to its e-commerce site. But the real benefit of having more than 2 billion people visit Amazon's website each month is the advertising revenue it can generate, and the subscription revenue brought in via Prime. Amazon topped 200 million Prime users in April 2021, and has almost certainly added to this figure since becoming the exclusive streaming partner of Thursday Night Football."", ""However, Amazon's premier cash flow driver is its cloud infrastructure service platform. Despite accounting for a sixth of the company's net sales, Amazon Web Services (AWS) consistently generates 50% to 100% of Amazon's operating income. AWS is the world's top cloud infrastructure service platform by spend, per Canalys."", ""Even though social media company Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is betting on a future fueled by AI and augmented/virtual reality, the company's core operations should sustain double-digit earnings growth and help lift its valuation well past Nvidia come 2027."", 'Meta\'s ""secret sauce"" is no secret at all. Despite its metaverse ambitions and big spending at Reality Labs, the company\'s bread-and-butter continues to be its social media empire. It\'s the parent of the most-visited social site on the planet (Facebook), and collectively attracted just shy of 4 billion monthly active users during the December-ended quarter with its family of apps. Just as advertisers willingly pay a premium to Alphabet\'s Google because of its dominance in internet search, Meta\'s ad-pricing power tends to be superior in most economic climates.', 'The other reason Meta can shine and completely close the roughly $1 trillion valuation gap between it and Nvidia over the coming three years is its balance sheet. Meta is a cash-flow machine. It generated more than $71 billion in net cash from operations last year and closed out 2023 with $65.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Not only does this cash provide a buffer to the downside, but it affords Meta the luxury of taking chances that few other companies can match.', ""A fourth company that can surpass AI stock Nvidia's market cap over the course of the next three years is conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B). Since Warren Buffett took the reins at Berkshire Hathaway in the mid-1960s, he's overseen an annualized average return on his company's Class A shares that's approaching 20%!"", 'One of the primary reasons Berkshire Hathaway has been such a moneymaker for investors is the ""Oracle of Omaha\'s"" love of dividend stocks. Berkshire is on track to collect in the neighborhood of $6 billion in payouts this year, with just five core holdings accounting for almost $4.4 billion in aggregate dividend income. Since dividend-paying companies are often profitable on a recurring basis and time-tested, they\'re just the type of businesses we\'d expect to grow in lockstep with the U.S. economy over long periods.', ""Warren Buffett and his investment team also gravitate to brand-name businesses with trusted management teams. For instance, the $155 billion invested in Apple adds up to almost 42% of Berkshire Hathaway's invested assets. Apple is one of the world's most-valuable brands, and CEO Tim Cook has done a masterful job of leading ongoing physical product innovation while also pivoting the company to a subscription services-driven future."", ""The fifth stock that'll be worth more than artificial intelligence stock Nvidia three years from now is payment-processing behemoth Visa (NYSE: V). As things stand now, Visa will have to close a nearly $1.7 trillion valuation gap. But if the AI bubble pops and Visa keeps doing what it's been doing for decades, it can happen."", ""What makes Visa tick is the company's long runway of opportunity. It's the undisputed market share leader in credit card network purchase volume in the U.S. (the largest market for consumption globally), and has a multidecade opportunity to organically or acquisitively push its payment infrastructure into underbanked regions, such as the Middle East, Africa, and Southeastern Asia. Visa should be able to sustain a double-digit earnings growth rate throughout the remainder of the decade, if not well beyond."", ""Visa's other source of success is its relatively conservative management team. Although it would probably be wildly successful as a lender, its leaders have chosen to keep the company solely focused on payment facilitation. The advantage of this approach is that Visa doesn't have to set aside capital to cover loan losses during economic downturns since it's not a lender. The result is a profit margin that's consistently hovered at or above 50%!"", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance down, giving back post-earning gains from last week. Analysts remain concerned about the drugstores outlook after it narrowed guidance for fiscal year 2024. One analyst from Jefferies, for example, lowering the price target on Walgreens to $19 from 20 to 50. Now, I wasn't here last week, Josh, maybe you can explain to me. But the company came out and me kind of looking back at the earnings report, it did look pretty negative. The commentary, they talked about a challenging retail environment. They narrowed that range for the forecast. They said it was a weaker than normal respiratory season. I guess that means like colds and allergies. But the stock did go up by 3%."", 'And then today--', 'JOSH LIPTON: They gave that back--', ""JULIE HYMAN: --you come in and you have a lot of analysts saying, yeah, it wasn't so great."", ""JOSH LIPTON: Yeah. I didn't see anybody changing their investment recommendations. I think we did see some folks, you know, cutting their targets a bit. And I guess they was just expressing different concerns. You know, Raymond James, they said, the second half EPS run rate, they kind of crunched the numbers, OK, we now think that implies a weak 25. Truist saying the weak consumer backdrop is impacting their ability to drive healthy growth and earnings performance improvements. So I think they basically looked over the earnings, took the weekend and decided some trends and themes they didn't like the look of."", 'JULIE HYMAN: And by the way, the stock is already down more than 40% over the past year. Just one other quick headline that I noticed here. Bloomberg picking up something in one of the filings for Walgreens, saying that the IRS is looking for $2.7 billion in unpaid taxes from the company. Now, again, that was out, it sounds like the other day in filings as well. And this is something that Walgreens is going to dispute. So it could take a while. But just another piece of data to consider.', 'JOSH LIPTON: Yeah. Certainly more noise for sure.']"

WBA's second quarter operational results were in line with our expectations despite continued challenges in the U S. retail environment. Adjusted EPs of $1.20 reflects good execution and cost discipline in our U.S. retail pharmacy segment, continued strong performance in the international, our first quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA in U.S. Healthcare, and positive impacts from tax planning benefits. During the quarter, we recognized a $5.8 billion after-tax non-cash goodwill impairment charge net of non-controlling interest related to our investment in VillageMD. This charge is excluded from any of our adjusted non-GAAP earnings measures. We are narrowing full year adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $3.20 to $3.35."", ""This guidance reflects the challenging retail environment in the U.S. and our decisions to both winddown the sale leaseback program and to sell additional shares of Cencora in a further effort to simplify our financial reporting. We expect these impacts to be partially offset by execution in pharmacy services and tax favorability. We have recently solidified our leadership team, which I believe has the capabilities and commitment to best lead WBA into its future. Once again, I'm excited to welcome our newest WBA leaders who were announced this quarter. Elizabeth Burger, as Chief Human Resources Officer, Lanesha Minnix as Chief Legal Officer, and Mary Langowski as President of U.S. Healthcare. They joined Manmohan Mahajan, who was confirmed as our Chief Financial Officer, and Beth Leonard, who was named our Chief Corporate Affairs Officer in rounding out our Executive Committee."", 'Together, our Executive Committee is comprised of individuals that bring an established track record of operational excellence and are all based together in Chicago, working to drive collaboration and acting with urgency to drive results. Over the next three months, we will continue the intense review of our portfolio of assets in an effort to ensure that each contributes to the growth we aspire to deliver and drives our go-forward strategy to be the leading retail pharmacy and health services partner that creates deep relationships and trust. Let me share further detail on the progress happening across our businesses to date. In our U.S. retail pharmacy business, we are navigating a challenging backdrop and exploring innovative pathways to boost profitability and growth.', ""Within retail, our US customers confronting considerable pressure from multiyear inflationary trends and depleted household savings with US household debt at record levels and delinquency rates on the rise. Our shopper is making deliberate choices to seek value resulting in channel shifting behavior. We're responding to these market dynamics by making investments in key value items and focusing our capabilities to engage with customers in an intelligent, targeted way. Additionally, we have implemented initiatives to improve front-end performance. We are leaning into the massive and timely opportunity to increase own brand penetration, now standing at 17.1%, up 95 basis points year-over-year. We expect that we can further expand with a meaningful margin advantage over national brands."", ""We plan to deepen our partnership with a reduced set of national suppliers, carefully selecting who we work with alongside our own brands. Operationally, we're intensely focused on the customer experience and meeting customers where, when, and how they want to shop. That means enhancing the experience not only in-store, but ordering online for pickup in-store and also same -day delivery, where over 80% of orders are received in less than an hour. Additionally, we are empowering our store managers and field leaders to share in our company’s anticipated growth and increase their ability to impact areas that matter most to their stores and their customers. To do this, we are realigning incentives in an effort to place much greater weight on individual store performance."", 'Moving to pharmacy, we delivered another quarter of strong execution with outperformance in pharmacy services led by our vaccines portfolio. While market growth was slower than originally anticipated, we maintained market share. Our 11 micro-fulfillment centers currently support 4, 600 stores, which is over half our footprint. Earlier this year, we talked about pausing the rollout of additional micro fulfillment centers as we work to optimize the model that gives our pharmacists and technicians the ability to spend more time on customer-facing activities and less time on core dispensing. We are seeing benefits, such as improved MPA scores, patient retention, and adherence. Not only is this better for the patient, it improves team member retention and talent acquisition as they perform more of the clinical activities that they are so well-trained to do.', ""We are focused on creating an environment that makes us the practice setting of choice for pharmacists. In fact, earlier this month, we kicked off our first Dean's Advisory Council meeting with the mission of re-energizing and evolving the definition of community pharmacy as demand for pharmacy services increases while the industry faces a pronounced labor shortage. We are on a mission to achieve provider status for our pharmacists given their influence, which was so clearly highlighted during the pandemic. This would allow them to be reimbursed for providing select health care services to patients. These are highly trained clinical professionals just five miles or less from most Americans whose scope of practice goes well beyond dispensing medications and includes immunizations, patient counseling, and point-of-care testing for infectious diseases."", ""As an example of what is ultimately possible, in the UK, the NHS Pharmacy First Service, which launched on January 31st, expands the role of Boots pharmacists throughout England to advise and prescribe for the treatment of seven common health conditions. This model serves as a use case of new ways to fully deploy pharmacist capabilities to lighten the burden on the broader healthcare system. Speaking of value, there is real opportunity for change and transparency in reimbursement models to help slow the inflationary pressures on drug prices and our patients' wallets. We already operate in the number of cost-plus and other alternative reimbursement models very successfully and welcome any model that reimburses us for the unmatched value we provide patients."", ""We are having more active and constructive conversations with PBMs and other payers around cost-plus models. Many of these discussions are still in early stages, but they share a general theme. There is value to all from a transparent, predictable model where what patients pay at the counter is rationally tied to the cost of the drug. We don't expect an industry shift to happen overnight, as there are a number of dynamics that need to be worked out, but it's especially encouraging to see PBMs and payers open to these models. Now turning to U.S. Healthcare, we have reached an important milestone, delivering our first ever quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA and another quarter of significant year-on-year growth. Shields continues to deliver strong top and bottom line performance as their differentiated model is driving significant value for health system partners, which has resulted in several recent long-term extensions."", ""VillageMD's actions to accelerate profitability, including recent rightsizing of their cost structure, optimizing their clinic footprint, and growing patient panels are driving improvement in adjusted EBITDA. Full risk lives grew by 19% year-on year in the second quarter. As Village prioritizes density in their highest opportunity markets, they decided in January to exit a total of approximately 160 clinics, inclusive of the 60 that had been previously communicated. As of today, they have already exited 140 locations. Manmohan will discuss in more detail our recent reevaluation of our investment in VillageMD. Shifting to International, the business once again performed well, demonstrating strong and consistent execution highlighted by meaningful retail comp growth at Boots UK and a 12th successive quarter of market share gains."", ""Finally, let me offer further detail on the progress of our swift actions to right-size the WBA cost structure and increase cash flow across the company. We have a very high degree of visibility into the $1 billion in cost savings this year as actions already taken to date will account for a significant majority of the total. We're driving savings primarily in our U.S. retail pharmacy segment in three ways. Organizational initiatives, including support office workforce reductions, location optimization, and additional pharmacy and retail operating model improvements. We are also working to improve cash flow by prioritizing projects and capital spend. In the first half, CapEx was $250 million lower than the prior year period. We are on track to deliver a $600 million reduction for the full year and $500 million in working capital benefits in fiscal 2024."", ""Next, I'd like to introduce Mary Langowski to say a few words. She'll then hand it over to Manmohan to review our financial results in further detail."", ""Mary Langowski : Thank you, Tim. Good morning, everyone. I'm excited to join you all today and I'm thrilled to be a part of this iconic company. I've spent 25 years in the healthcare, government, and retail sectors. My career is focused on leading teams to unlock new areas of growth, commercialize new products and healthcare services, and accelerate execution through financial discipline. I've been fortunate to have worked with some of the most successful Fortune 50 and healthcare growth companies that have sought to embrace and drive change to improve the healthcare system. At CVS Health, I led and executed a strategy to expand healthcare services, leveraging the company's core assets, including leading aspects of CVS' acquisition of Aetna."", 'Most recently, I was CEO of Solera Health, a leading digital health technology company serving payers and employers, where I led a transformation of the business, launching new condition product lines, a new technology platform, and a new economic model to support sustained growth. My vantage point of working across providers, pharma, payers, and retail has made one thing clear. Very few companies have the platform, access, and reach of Walgreens. Since the announcement, I have heard from health plans, health systems, and others who see an opportunity to partner with Walgreens. They know the value of our community presence, the role our pharmacists can play, and the need for higher touch, more frequent, and lower cost engagement to drive better health outcomes.', ""Healthcare is changing and consumer expectations are changing. In the face of that, we believe Walgreens is still the best position to be the most convenient entry point into the healthcare system. And our position as an independent partner, able to work with any health plan of PBM, is a true strength that we will capitalize on. Finally, I want to congratulate the team on achieving positive adjusted EBITDA in U.S. healthcare this quarter. It's a significant milestone, and we will continue to build on this progress to drive value for our shareholders, customers, and patients. Thanks to Tim and the board for this opportunity. I'll now turn it to Manmohan."", 'Manmohan Mahajan : Thank you, Mary, and good morning, everyone. Overall, second quarter operational results were in line with our expectations. Sales grew 5.7% on a constant currency basis. U.S. Retail Pharmacy increased 4.7%, International was up 3.2%, and U.S. Healthcare delivered performance sales growth of 14%. Adjusted EPS of $1.20 increased year-over-year by 2.8% on a constant currency basis. Reflecting improved profitability in our U.S. Healthcare segment, impact of cost savings, and a lower adjusted effective tax rate. Offset by the lower U.S. retail performance and lower sale leaseback gains. The lower adjusted effective tax rate reflects the initial recognition of a deferred tax asset in certain international jurisdictions.', 'GAAP net loss for the second quarter included a $5.8 billion noncash impairment charge related to VillageMD goodwill. During the fourth quarter of fiscal ‘23, we disclosed that our annual goodwill impairment test for our VillageMD reporting unit resulted in its fair value exceeding its carrying value by a narrow margin. As a result, we have been closely monitoring the performance of the business for potential indicators of impairment. In February, we received a downward revised longer-term forecast from VillageMD management. Including the impact of closing approximately 160 clinics, inclusive of the 60 previously communicated, slower than expected trends in patient panel growth and multi-specialty productivity and recent changes in Medicare reimbursement models.', ""These impacts were partly offset by actions taken in an attempt to right-size the cost structure. Given this revised forecast, we performed an interim test of VillageMD reporting unit goodwill that resulted in a fair value below its carrying value. Accordingly, we recognized a $12.4 billion noncash goodwill impairment charge prior to the attribution of loss to non-controlling interests. On an after-tax basis and net of 47% non-controlling interest, this resulted in a net loss of $5.8 billion in the quarter. This charge is excluded from non-GAAP earnings measures. The fair value of the business was determined using a combination of the income and market approaches. The impairment charge is due to the lower than previously expected longer-term financial performance expectations, challenged market multiples for VillageMD's peer group, which have continued to decline, and increased discount rates."", ""As a reminder, our share of VillageMD's net assets carrying value also included a $2 billion gain recognized on the equity interest owned by the company immediately prior to the acquisition of majority equity interest in VillageMD during the first quarter of fiscal ‘22. This goodwill write-off is noncash, and we do not believe it will have a significant impact on our financial position or our ability to invest across businesses going forward. During the first half of fiscal ‘24, we have seen positive financial impacts from the recent actions taken by VillageMD management team to accelerate profitability. We believe the focused approach on improving performance in core markets, as well as rightsizing the cost structure, will provide VillageMD a platform for future growth."", 'The second quarter also included a $455 million noncash impairment charge related to certain long-lived assets in the U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment. As part of a deep dive exercise over the last several months, we concluded during the quarter that instead of continuing to build a new technology platform for pharmacy operations in the U.S., it would be better to modernize our existing system over time with new capabilities in an agile and capital-efficient manner with much lower disruption risk. As a result, we recognize the charge against the underlying software and development assets. Finally, similar to last quarter, we recognized a $474 million gain on the sale of Cencora shares, partly offset by a $396 million after-tax noncash charge for fair value adjustments on variable prepaid forward derivatives related to Cencora shares.', ""Now let's move on to the first half highlights. Sales increased 7.2% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EPS declined 20.5% on constant currency basis due to software U.S. retail performance and lower sale leaseback gains, partly offset by improved profitability in U.S. Healthcare and a lower adjusted effective tax rate. GAAP net loss was $6 billion compared to a loss of $3 billion in the first half of fiscal ‘23. As I explained earlier, the second half of the fiscal ‘24 included certain noncash impairment charges. The prior year period included a $5.4 billion after-tax charge for opioid-related claims and lawsuits, partly offset by a $1.4 billion after-tax gain on the sale of Cencora shares. Now let me cover US Retail Pharmacy segment."", 'Note that all comparable figures are on a leap year adjusted basis for all segments. Sales grew 4.7% year-on-year driven by brand inflation in pharmacy, prescription volume, and a higher contribution from pharmacy services, which was partly offset by a 4.5% decline in the retail business. AOI declined 29.50% versus the prior year quarter due to lower retail sales volume, elevated levels of shrink and lower sale leaseback gains. Partially offset continued progress on cost savings initiatives. Looking ahead, we are winding down the sale leaseback program and we do not anticipate any material benefit going forward. Sale leaseback gains, net of incremental rent expense, were an approximately $125 million headwind to AOI in the quarter. Let me now turn to U.S. Pharmacy.', 'Pharmacy comp sales increased 8.7%, mainly driven by brand inflation, volume growth, and contribution from pharmacy services. Comp scripts grew 2.9% excluding immunizations in line with the overall prescription market. The ongoing impact of Medicaid redeterminations continued to negatively impact overall market growth. Pharmacy services performed better than expectations driven by our vaccines portfolio. Pharmacy adjusted gross profit was down slightly versus the prior year quarter, with margin negatively impacted by brand mixed impacts and reimbursement pressure net of procurement savings. Turning next to our U.S. Retail business. We continue to see a challenging retail environment with a shift in discretionary spend away from the drug channel as consumers seek value.', 'Comparable retail sales declined 4.3% in the quarter. There were three main drivers. First, as consumer continue pull back on discretionary spending, we saw an impact of approximately 170 basis points from weaker sales in holiday seasonal and general merchandise categories. Second, as expected, we saw a weaker than normal respiratory season, which directly impacted comparable sales by approximately 90 basis points. Third party data showed flu, cold, and respiratory activity was down 6% compared to the prior year quarter. In addition, As cost cold, flu serves as a primary trip driver, there was also an incremental impact from the lower attachment sales. Lastly, weather conditions in January led to a headwind of approximately 40 basis points in the quarter.', ""Retail gross margin declined year-on-year, impacted by higher shrink, partly offset by benefits from category performance improvement program. Turning next to the International segment, and as always, I will talk in constant currency numbers. The International segment again exceeded our expectations in this quarter, total sales grew 3.2% with Boots UK increasing 3% and Germany wholesale up 5.3%. Segment adjusted growth profit increased by 3.2%. Adjusted operating income was down 32% entirely due to lapping the real estate gains in the year ago period, with underlying growth offsetting inflationary pressures. Let's now cover Boots, UK in detail. Comp pharmacy sales were up 1.7%. Comp retail sales increased 5.9% with all categories showing growth, led by beauty and personal care."", 'Across formats, destination health and beauty, flagship, and travel locations performed particularly well. Boots.com sales increased 16.8% year-on-year and represented over 17% of our UK retail sales. Turning next to US Healthcare. The US Healthcare segment delivered its first quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA. This was the third consecutive quarter of significant year-on-year improvement in adjusted EBITDA. Second quarter sales of $2.2 billion increased 33% compared to the prior year quarter aided by the acquisition of Summit Health. On a pro forma basis, segment sales increased 14%. VillageMD sales of $1.6 billion grew 20% on a pro forma basis. The year-on-year increase was driven by same clinic performance and growth in full risk lives.', ""Shield sales were up 13% as new health system contracts and expansion of existing partnerships led to an over 40% increase in the number of patients on service in the quarter versus the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was $17 million, an improvement of $127 million compared to last year, mainly driven by VillageMD and Shields. We believe VillageMD continues to make progress to accelerate profitability by rightsizing its cost structure and growing its patient panel. Shields saw robust adjusted EBITDA growth compared to the prior year period. Turning next to cash flow. Operating cash flows in the first half of fiscal ‘24 was negatively impacted by roughly $700 million in payments related to legal matters, $380 million Annuity premium contributions related to Boot's pension plan and underlying seasonality."", 'Capital expenditures declined by $250 million versus the first half of fiscal ‘23. As a result, free cash flow was down by approximately $2 billion versus the prior year. We expect second half free cash flow improvement compared to the first half driven by several factors. First, we expect lower payments related to legal matters in the second half of fiscal ‘24. Second, we remain on track to reduce capital expenditure by approximately $600 million year-over-year. Third, we expect to deliver working capital improvement of $500 million during fiscal ‘24. While we did see some benefit of these initiatives during the first half of ‘24, we expect the majority of these benefits will impact the second half. Lastly, similar to prior years, we believe the underlying working capital seasonality in the U.S. Retail Pharmacy and International segments will have a favorable impact on the second half of the year compared to the first half.', 'I will now turn to guidance. We are narrowing our fiscal ‘24 adjusted EPS guidance to $3.20 to $3.35. The updated range incorporates a challenging US retail environment, lower sale leaseback gains, and reduced Cencora equity income offset by the execution in pharmacy services and a lower adjusted effective tax rate. On the tailwinds, we continue to see strong execution in our pharmacy services business, which has delivered results ahead of our initial plan to date. In addition, we now expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be under 5%. On the headwinds, we expect the challenging retail backdrop will continue to negatively impact our US retail sales in the short term. We now expect fiscal ‘24 retail comp sales to be down approximately 3%.', 'Second, with the early winddown of the sale leaseback program, no material gains are expected in the future. Third, the block sale of Cencora shares in February will reduce equity earnings going forward. Lastly, as discussed with the first quarter results, we forecast slightly lower market growth in US pharmacy business compared to our initial guidance. Importantly, based on the progress made in the US Healthcare segment through the first half, we continue to expect segment adjusted EBITDA to be breakeven at the midpoint of the guidance range. This represents an increase of $325 million to $425 million over fiscal ‘23. Next, I will provide additional details on the factors impacting earnings in the second half. In the second half, we will be lapping adjusted EPS of $1.66 in prior year period.', 'We expect several key factors to impact the year-over-year comparison. First, the winddown of the sale leaseback program is expected to be a significant headwind in the second half. Second, we will lap incentive accruals reduction in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal ‘23. Third, our updated guidance implies a higher tax rate over the remainder of the year. The US Healthcare segment remains on track to achieve $165 million of year-over-year adjusted EBITDA improvement in the second half, based on the midpoint of the guidance range. And finally, within our U.S. Retail Pharmacy business, we expect year-on-year improvement in the second half, driven by cost savings initiatives. With that, let me now pass it back to Tim for his closing remarks.', ""Tim Wentworth: To wrap up, we have hard work ahead of us in our journey to simplify and strengthen WBA, but we are encouraged by our progress. This team has a clear mandate to act with everything on the table to put our business on the right track. We are well-positioned to drive capital-efficient growth, rooted in our retail pharmacy footprint, and build out an asset light health services strategy to deliver care for communities and create value for partners. We've kicked off our strategic planning work. Over the next three to six months, this team is undergoing an in-depth analysis to determine the actions necessary to achieve what we believe will be the optimal portfolio with a focus on maximizing growth potential and generating cash flow."", ""We are reviewing every business through a longer-term lens focused on strategic fit, synergy potential, financial upside, and new or complementary capabilities. We are taking a thoughtful approach, fueled by a sense of urgency to finding opportunities to unlock value or validate existing pathways. In my five months with WBA, I have been most impressed with our 330, 000 team members' commitment to our company. In my experience, it's very hard to get that. That pride is foundational to our future growth, ability to consistently execute and create sustainable long-term shareholder value. That dedication also gives me and our team great confidence in our future. Now I would like to open the line for questions.

Well, I did speak to one franchise owner who said that this will cost him 470,000 additional dollars annually. And so he has to let go some workers. That's what he's choosing to do.

While the $400 million earmarked for the deal will only put a small dent in the oil and gas services giant's current cash hoard of $7.8 billion, the decision itself quietly speaks volumes about where the energy business is ultimately headed. It just so happens to be saying it even louder for fellow oil and gas company Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY), which is arguably further down the carbon-capture road than any other name in the business."", 'But first things first.', ""Don't sweat it if you're not familiar with it. Most people probably aren't. Carbon capture is a relatively young science."", ""Just as the name suggests, carbon capture refers to the extraction of carbon dioxide gas that would otherwise make its way into the atmosphere, where it can contribute to global warming. Sometimes this captured CO2 is put back into the ground where it doesn't cause problems for the environment. Other times, it can be utilized to create chemicals, make plastics, and even improve the production of oil and natural gas wells."", ""There's a handful of ways of capturing this carbon dioxide. Some of them are implemented right at the source of creation, like filtering it out of whatever normally spews from a power plant's smokestack. Other approaches simply remove it from ambient air. All of them work to varying degrees. As you can imagine, though, this technology isn't cheap. That's why it's still relatively uncommon. But the cost is coming down."", 'Enter Aker Carbon Capture. The Norwegian company\'s ""Just Catch"" systems are capable of extracting 95% of the CO2 found in industrial exhaust -- up to 400,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year -- before it\'s ever released into the atmosphere.', ""There are two ways the company's technology can be monetized. One of them is the outright sale of Aker's Just Catch and similar systems. The other way is allowing Aker to extract the CO2 being created at a particular facility, and paying the service provider on the basis of the weight of carbon dioxide it captures. Both business models are marketable, and increasingly so as the world regulates its way toward a zero-carbon future."", ""Seeing this inevitability on the horizon, SLB (which you may know better as Schlumberger) is simply positioning itself now to capitalize on a key part of the energy industry's future."", ""Great, but what does any of this have to do with Occidental? It's simple -- the company's already in the carbon capture business. Indeed, it built what was then the world's biggest carbon capture facility back in 2010, only to shutter that site in order to erect an even bigger and more efficient direct-air carbon-capture facility in Ector County, Texas. This so-called STRATOS project will be capable of capturing up to 500,000 metric tons of CO2 per year."", ""That isn't much more than the annual capture capacity of one of Aker's biggest carbon capture systems. STRATOS is much more flexible, though, in that it's able to extract carbon dioxide from the air regardless of how and where that CO2 entered it. This approach still satisfies the growing legal requirements that companies take responsibility for their carbon footprint by removing much of the carbon dioxide they ultimately create."", ""In this vein, Amazon, Airbus, and a couple of professional sports teams are already signed up as future paying customers. CEO Vicki Hollub thinks Occidental's carbon capture customer count could reach 1,000 when all is said and done."", ""Occidental Petroleum's potential as a carbon-capture service provider is augmented by its efforts to find ways of doing something constructive with this captured carbon dioxide gas. It's been using CO2 to improve oil and gas well yields since the 1980s. And it's partnered with biotech company Cemvita in finding ways to use CO2 as the basis for the creation of industrial chemicals and polymers."", ""Occidental's upside to the removal of carbon dioxide is twofold. First (and most obviously), there's money to be made with this tech, either by outright selling carbon capture systems or performing the work on behalf of companies that want to punt such duties to qualified experts."", ""Given its young age, the size and potential revenue of the carbon capture and carbon-storage market remains a bit fuzzy. To the extent reasonable guesses can be made, Global Market Insights suggests this business that's worth $7 billion a year now will grow to an annual business of around $35 billion by 2032. Those numbers jibe with outlooks from Spherical Insights as well as Precedence Research. Environmentally minded regulatory requirements will be driving the vast majority of this growth."", ""The other upside for Occidental Petroleum is less obvious -- until it's plainly pointed out. That is, if fossil fuels' prospective harm to the environment can be negated, the use of oil and natural gas can continue on well into the foreseeable future."", ""And that's no small matter."", ""See, for all the efforts that have been made to create environmentally friendly renewable sources of energy, these still only account for a minority of the world's total power production. The United States' Energy Information Administration reports that petroleum is still at the heart of about one-third of the country's total power consumption, while natural gas makes up another one-third. Moreover, Standard & Poor's believes that even as far down the road as 2050 that petroleum will still be the world's single-biggest source of energy."", ""While the need is already great and still growing, the world can't afford to simply let the CO2 from that power production continue entering the atmosphere."", ""Given all of this, Warren Buffett's continued interest in energy stocks in general -- and Occidental Petroleum in particular -- suddenly makes much more sense."", 'As Buffett explained of Berkshire Hathaway\'s 244 million-share position in Occidental in his latest annual letter to Berkshire shareholders, ""We particularly like its vast oil and gas holdings in the United States, as well as its leadership in carbon-capture initiatives."" That\'s a rather specific mention from someone who tends to focus on the bigger picture rather than the smaller details. The fact that Buffett made a point of pointing out Occidental\'s work on the carbon capture front at all illustrates just how important this tech is -- if not right now, then at least soon. Underscoring Buffett\'s message is the fact that SLB is now ramping up its investment in the very same arena.', 'So, take the hint. Occidental is clearly onto something here.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Occidental Petroleum right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Occidental Petroleum, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Occidental Petroleum wasn’t one of them.

(NASDAQ:NFLX) saw a significant share price rise of 31% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. The company's trading levels have reached its high for the past year, following the recent bounce in the share price. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Today we will analyse the most recent data on Netflix’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists."", ' See our latest analysis for Netflix ', 'According to our valuation model, Netflix seems to be fairly priced at around 1.81% above our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Netflix today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $603.40, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Netflix’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.', ""Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Netflix's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 99%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value."", 'Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in NFLX’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on NFLX, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.', 'Diving deeper into the forecasts for Netflix mentioned earlier will help you understand how analysts view the stock going forward.

Brent crude now trading around $87 a barrel. So we've had a strong quarter for oil."", ""OPEC will have a smaller online meeting this week.

As some traders were expecting, perhaps June they would scale something back. But now it could be through the end of the year."", ""But as one oil trader put it to me, he said, look, history shows that when oil continues to be above $80 a barrel, OPEC tends to overproduce. I also do want to mention that I spoke to one analyst recently that told me that with this whole consolidation that you're seeing in the Permian Basin-- last year, you saw record production. You had smaller oil producers as well contributing to that production."", 'Well, when you have a consolidation, that kind of starts to set the tone for a controlled production, so to speak.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. So when we looked at NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) and its trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw."", ""If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for NextEra Energy:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.067 = US$10b ÷ (US$177b - US$28b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""So, NextEra Energy has an ROCE of 6.7%.

If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for NextEra Energy ."", ""While in absolute terms it isn't a high ROCE, it's promising to see that it has been moving in the right direction. Over the last five years, returns on capital employed have risen substantially to 6.7%. Basically the business is earning more per dollar of capital invested and in addition to that, 74% more capital is being employed now too. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at NextEra Energy thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital."", ""All in all, it's terrific to see that NextEra Energy is reaping the rewards from prior investments and is growing its capital base. Since the stock has returned a solid 51% to shareholders over the last five years, it's fair to say investors are beginning to recognize these changes. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence."", ""If you want to know some of the risks facing NextEra Energy we've found 3 warning signs (1 is potentially serious!) that you should be aware of before investing here."", 'For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.', 'Have feedback on this article?

Surging interest rates have delivered a double whammy. They've made borrowing money to refinance existing funding and finance new acquisitions a lot more expensive. They have also weighed on its stock price, which has lost two-thirds of its value from the peak. That has driven up its dividend yield to more than 10%. "", 'However, that headwind should fade this year as the Federal Reserve cuts rates. In addition, the company is working hard to shore up its financial position so it can start growing again. If everything goes according to plan, these catalysts could give the renewable energy company the power to produce prodigious total returns.', 'NextEra Energy Partners pays one of the highest-yielding dividends around. At the current rate, a $1,000 investment could generate more than $100 of annual dividend income.', ""The big question is whether the company can maintain its monster yield. NextEra Energy Partners currently has no plan to cut its dividend. Instead, it intends to continue growing its payout through at least 2026. The company aims to increase it by 5% to 8% annually with a target of 6% growth. While that's slower than its initial forecast of 12%-15% annual dividend growth, it's a solid dividend growth rate, especially from such a high-yielding stock. "", ""However, there is one huge caveat. NextEra Energy Partners expects its dividend payout ratio will be in the mid-90s through 2026. That's extremely high and leaves little margin for error. If everything doesn't go perfectly according to plan, the company might need to press pause on increasing the payout or even reduce its dividend to get more breathing room. "", 'NextEra Energy Partners unveiled a two-part strategy last year to address its balance sheet issues while continuing to grow its dividend. The first part is to become a pure-play renewable energy producer by selling off its gas pipeline assets. It intends to use the cash from those sales to buy out its remaining convertible equity portfolio financings (CEPFs) as those acquisition funding vehicles mature over the next few years. It will use any remaining proceeds to make acquisitions. ', 'The company sold its STX Midstream assets to Kinder Morgan for $1.8 billion last year. It used that cash to repay related debt and will use the remaining money to complete the buyouts of CEPFs that mature through June 2025. NextEra Energy Partners plans to sell its remaining gas pipeline assets, Meade Pipeline, next year. That sale should help fund additional CEPFs and provide it with all the equity funding it needs to make acquisitions until 2027. ', ""The company has also shifted its near-term growth strategy from acquiring operating renewable energy assets from its parent, NextEra Energy, to organic growth. It has identified 1.3 gigawatts of existing wind energy assets it intends to repower through 2026. These high-return projects replace legacy wind turbines with larger, more powerful ones that produce more electricity and cash flow. NextEra Energy Partners believes that repowering projects alone can power its plan to increase its dividend by 6% this year. Meanwhile, it estimates it won't require additional equity capital to fund its growth until 2027. "", ""NextEra Energy Partners has tremendous total return potential if it can execute its plan. It could pay a monster dividend that would continue to rise while enhancing its financial foundation. Redeeming its CEPFs would help lift some of the weight off its stock price. Add the potential uplift from falling rates, and the company's stock price could rebound sharply. That would enable it to use its equity to make acquisitions again, potentially accelerating growth. While there's a lot of risk that things won't go according to plan, which could cause it to cut its dividend, the upside potential is very compelling."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in NextEra Energy Partners right now?', 'Before you buy stock in NextEra Energy Partners, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and NextEra Energy Partners wasn’t one of them.

144,b5524ced-d1f8-3eb6-997b-c3f4600a5879,WFC,2024-04-02,3 S&P 500 Bank Stocks That Outperformed the Index in Q1,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-p-500-bank-stocks-125400419.html,1711976040,STORY,"['USB', 'JPM', '^GSPC', 'WFC', 'C']","['The first quarter of 2024 was the banner one for the S&P 500 Index. It rallied more than 10% during the period, thus marking the best first-quarter performance in five years.This also reflected that the momentum that started in November 2023 has continued this year as well. The primary drivers for the steady uptrend in the index are the clarity on the path of interest rates and robust economic growth, along with persistently cooling inflation numbers. Thus, almost all the sectors within the S&P 500 Index rallied during the first quarter. Among the top three was the Financial Services, which gained 12% during the said time frame.One of the largest constituents of the sector – banks – were in the spotlight as the Federal Reserve continued to signal a 75-basis points cut in rates this year. Of the banks that are part of the S&P 500 Index, only Citigroup C, Wells Fargo WFC and JPMorgan JPM outperformed the index. These three currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.Here’s how these three big banks have performed in the first quarter of 2024:Price Performance in Q1', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Before we discuss the above-mentioned three banks, let’s check out the reasons (in detail) that drove investor confidence in bank stocks.One of the key reasons for the bullish investor sentiments was the Fed’s signal of interest rate cuts later in 2024. Though, initially, the market participants projected the first cut in rates occurring as early as March, incoming economic data showed that the central bank will wait for further confirmation on inflation cooling down before doing so.Secondly, the imminent recession risk is largely gone and the U.S. economy is showing resilience. The country’s real GDP increased to 2.5% in 2023 from 1.9% in 2022. Further, per the Fed’s latest Summary of Economic Projections, the real GDP is expected to grow at the rate of 2.1% in 2024. This is an upward swing from the prior expectation of 1.4% growth. With the anticipation that inflation will continue to come closer to the Fed’s 2% goal, the chances of the U.S. economy’s soft landing are high.Hence, driven by these developments, investors continue to be bullish on bank stocks. With the central bank keeping the rates stable at 5.25-5.5%, deposit costs are stabilizing and even coming down. Thus, pressure on the net interest margin is likely to decline eventually.\xa0 Further, as the economy remains strong, the lending scenario is likely to be decent. Hence, the banks’ net interest income (NII) is expected to be stable.But banks are not fully out of the woods. The major concern is the exposure to commercial real estate (CRE) loans. This is turning out to be a stress on the banks’ asset quality. The major rating agencies, including S&P Global Ratings, Fitch and Moody’s, have been flagging exposure to CRE loans as a key concerning factor for the industry. The slump in commercial property values will likely hurt the regional banks to some extent.Nevertheless, at present, investors are seeing interest rate cuts and robust economic growth as major positives for the industry than the CRE exposure woes. Driven by these favorable factors, bank stocks are expected to keep performing solidly in the near term.', 'Citigroup: As a globally diversified financial services holding company, Citigroup continues to increase its fee-based business mix and shrink non-core businesses. In sync with this, the company has announced the completion of major actions to simplify its operating structure and improve performance, which were announced in September 2023.As a part of this initiative, since September, C has eliminated more than 5,000 jobs and plans to trim management layers to eight from 13 and its global workforce by 20,000 over the next two years. Such efforts will make the decision-making process swifter, drive increased accountability and enhance the focus on clients.Citigroup is also on track with its major strategic action to exit the consumer banking business in 14 markets across Asia and the EMEA. The bank has divested businesses in nine markets, including Australia, Bahrain, India, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia. It has substantially wound down consumer banking businesses in South Korea, Russia and China. Also, the company has restarted its sale procedure in Poland. It remains on track to separate its Mexico business through an IPO in 2025.Such exits will free up capital and help the company pursue investments in wealth management operations in Singapore, Hong Kong, the UAE and London to stoke fee income growth.It seems that the investors are optimistic about initiatives being undertaken to simplify operations, and this supported the company’s stock to become the top-performing bank in the S&P 500 index.Further, management expects revenues in the range of $80-$81 billion in 2024, up from $75.3 billion in 2023. Though NII is expected to be marginally down because of higher funding costs, fee income is likely to offer some support.Wells Fargo: One of the largest banks in the country, Wells Fargo is gradually resolving regulatory issues that have been plaguing it since the revelation of the sales scandal in 2016. Though it remains under close supervision of the regulatory authorities and has an asset cap in place, the recent developments show the lender is on the right path.Since third-quarter 2020, WFC has been actively engaging in cost-cutting measures, including the streamlining of its organizational structure, closure of branches and reduction in headcount. The bank delivered gross expense savings aggregating $10 billion in 2021-2023. It expects to continue with these efficiency initiatives in 2024. Management projects non-interest expenses to be $52.6 billion this year, indicating a decline from the $55.6 billion in 2023.Wells Fargo is revamping its home lending operation by reducing its mortgage servicing portfolio and exiting the correspondent lending business. As the demand for mortgages and refinancing activities continue to be low due to higher rates, the company is executing this plan to “continue to reduce risk in the mortgage business.”WFC continues to build on its deposit base, which witnessed a three-year (ended 2023) CAGR of 1.1%. A large base of retail clients, as well as considerable strength in the consumer business and commercial banking segments, will likely aid the deposit balance in the upcoming period.JPMorgan: The largest U.S. bank, JPMorgan, is expected to keep benefiting from higher rates, loan growth, strategic acquisitions, business diversification efforts, strong liquidity position and initiatives to expand the branch network in new markets.Last May, JPM took over the failed First Republic Bank for $10.6 billion after almost two months of joint efforts with other lenders to save the flagging institution. The deal immensely supported the company’s financials last year.By expanding its footprint in newer markets, JPMorgan will be able to improve cross-selling opportunities by increasing its presence in the card and auto loan sectors. Apart from this, the company launched its digital retail bank Chase in the U.K. in 2021 and plans to further expand the reach of its digital bank across the European Union countries. JPMorgan is also focused on expanding the CIB and AWM businesses in China.JPMorgan has a solid capital deployment plan. In March, the company raised its quarterly dividend for the second time in the past year. It announced a dividend of $1.15 per share, marking a 9.5% increase from the prior payout. Last year, following the clearance of the 2023 stress test, JPM increased its quarterly dividend by 5% to $1.05 per share.Raising quarterly dividends seems to be a way to reward its shareholders after notching record profits in 2023 despite turmoil in the banking industry and challenging macroeconomic backdrop. Driven by a strong capital position and earnings strength, the company is expected to sustain current capital deployments. This will also enhance shareholder value.', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

With thousands of tradable securities, including exchange-traded funds (ETFs), Wall Street offers investors of all walks and risk tolerances a path to grow their wealth.', ""But among these seemingly countless pathways to riches is one that's undeniably toward the top of the pack: buying and holding high-quality dividend stocks."", 'Last year, Hartford Funds released a lengthy report (""The Power of Dividends: Past, Present, and Future"") that examined the multiple ways dividend stocks have outperformed non-payers over extended periods.', 'In a collaboration with Ned Davis Research, Hartford Funds noted that dividend-paying companies produced an average annual return of 9.18% spanning 50 years (1973-2022), and did so while being 6% less volatile than the benchmark S&P 500. By comparison, the average annual return from non-payers was less than half that of dividend stocks (3.95%) over a half-century, and the non-payers were 18% more volatile than the broad-based S&P 500.', ""Companies that pay a consistent dividend to their shareholders are usually profitable on a recurring basis and time-tested. In short, they're just the type of businesses we'd expect to increase their valuations over the long term."", ""However, income seekers don't have to settle for paltry yields when seeking out dividend stocks to buy. Although studies have shown that yield and risk have a tendency to go hand-in-hand -- i.e., high-yield stocks come with added risks -- proper vetting can reveal some high-octane income gems."", 'As we leap into April, three magnificent ultra-high-yield stocks, with an average yield of 9.02%, stand out as screaming buys.', 'The first amazing dividend stock with a premium yield that you can confidently add to your portfolio in April is none other than pharmaceutical juggernaut Pfizer (NYSE: PFE).', ""Pfizer stock recently hit a decade-low, with the overhang from the COVID-19 pandemic acting as a cement weight around its proverbial ankles. As one of the few companies to successfully develop a COVID-19 vaccine (Comirnaty), as well as an oral tablet designed to lessen the severity of COVID-19 (Paxlovid), Pfizer's sales soared during the early stages of the pandemic. But with the worst now behind us, combined sales of these drugs have tumbled from over $56 billion in 2022 to an estimated $8 billion this year."", ""While this seesaw in sales has crimped the necks of Wall Street analysts, some investors have clearly lost sight that Pfizer is far better off now, from a financial standpoint, than it was prior to the pandemic. Not only is it generating an extra $8 billion in annual sales from its core COVID-19 lineup, but the company's vast non-COVID portfolio of therapeutics has continued to grow on an organic basis."", ""For example, if sales for Comirnaty and Paxlovid are stripped out, operating revenue for all of Pfizer's other novel drugs rose by 7% in 2023. The company's guidance calls for another 3% to 5% operating sales growth, sans Comirnaty and Paxlovid, in 2024."", ""Something else to note is that Pfizer's bottom line will take an approximate $0.40-per-share hit this year following the acquisition of cancer-drug developer Seagen. This is a temporary speed bump that will give way to cost-savings and a vastly superior cancer-drug pipeline and product portfolio beginning in 2025."", ""The highly defensive nature of the healthcare sector is another reason income investors can trust Pfizer. No matter what's happening with the stock market or U.S. economy, people still need prescription medicines. This tends to lead to highly predictable operating cash flow in any economic climate."", ""Shares of Pfizer can be scooped up right now for just 11 times forward-year earnings, which is an attractive valuation for a company that'll pay you more than 6% annually to be patient."", 'A second magnificent ultra-high-yield dividend stock that\'s begging to be bought in April is cannabis-focused real estate investment trust (REIT) Innovative Industrial Properties (NYSE: IIPR). ""IIP,"" as the company is more commonly known, has increased its quarterly payout by 1,113% since issuing its first distribution in July 2017.', ""IIP has contended with two very clear headwinds. First, marijuana stocks lost their buzz in early 2021 after it became clear that the Biden administration and a Democrat-led Congress wouldn't be passing much in the way of cannabis-reform measures."", ""The other issue is that a small number of IIP's tenants became delinquent on their rent early in 2023. All REITs eventually deal with delinquencies, and it's how they respond to these challenges that dictates their outlook. IIP's management team was able to rework some of its master-lease agreements, as well as sell a couple of properties, to move its rent collection rate back to 100% by February 2024."", 'One of the factors that makes Innovative Industrial Properties such a smart buy for REIT investors is that a vast majority (95.8%) of its asset portfolio of more than 100 properties is triple-net leased. A triple-net lease requires the tenant to cover all expenses pertaining to the property, including utilities, maintenance, property taxes, and insurance premiums. While rental rates are lower for triple-net leases, it also absolves IIP from dealing with surprise expenses.', ""Interestingly enough, IIP is one of the few companies that's actually benefiting from the congressional stalemate on cannabis reform. Since most multi-state operators (MSOs) have limited access to basic financial services, IIP has leaned on sale-leaseback agreements as a solution. IIP purchases medical marijuana cultivation and/or processing assets from MSOs using cash and immediately leases the property back to the seller. This nets IIP a long-term tenant and yields highly predictable cash flow."", ""Given the long-term growth potential of legalized cannabis in the U.S., Innovative Industrial Properties' forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of less than 18, and its 7% yield, are both enticing."", 'The third magnificent ultra-high-yield dividend stock that makes for a screaming buy in April is coal company Alliance Resource Partners (NASDAQ: ARLP). Yes, you did read that correctly -- I said, ""coal company.""', 'Entering the decade, coal stocks were left for dead. Historically low interest rates and a strong U.S. economy were expected to fuel global investment in wind and solar solutions. However, the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic changed those plans.', ""During the pandemic, global energy companies were forced to significantly reduce their capital spending due to a historic demand cliff for energy commodities. In the wake of the pandemic, domestic interest rates have soared and global crude oil supply has remained tight. It's coal companies like Alliance Resource Partners that have stepped up to fill the energy-demand void."", ""Although Alliance Resource Partners has enjoyed selling its coal at a historically high per-ton price, much of the company's success can be attributed to its management team. In particular, Alliance Resource has historically booked production up to four years in advance.

The number of postdocs in the biological and biomedical fields has declined 9% between 2018 and 2022, and those in health-related fields have fallen by 8%, according to a survey published on March 20 by the National Science Foundation.', 'The problem is that postdocs are a critical component of the research and development workforce.', '“Science postdocs perform the science,” Donna Ginther, an economist who studies the science labor market at the University of Kansas, told CNN. “They’re actually in the lab doing the work, so they make very important contributions to new scientific discovery.”', 'Those contributions are part of a long game. Biomedical companies take scientific contributions and, over time, aggregate them into a commercial product. Building on the discovery of mRNA in the 1960’s, the technology behind an mRNA vaccine for humans was in development for decades before the Covid-19 vaccine was first administered in 2020.', '“It takes a long time from that first discovery to turn it into a product,” said Ginther.', 'In 2005, researchers learned that RNA could have immense therapeutic potential, but “found there was no interest” in this discovery, Nobel Prize-winning biochemist Dr. Katalin Kariko told Wired Magazine in 2020.', 'By using that technology to develop their mRNA vaccines for Covid-19, pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer and Moderna made a windfall in profits. Between 2020 and 2021, Pfizer saw its revenue nearly double. In the same period, Moderna’s total revenue skyrocketed from $803 million to $18.5 billion, astounding growth the company said was “primarily due to commercial sales of (the) COVID-19 vaccine.”', 'Ginther said most biotech and biomedical companies aren’t concerned with funding basic science like universities.', '“Most corporations are publicly traded, and they’re always looking at the bottom line,” she said. “That’s how they make money is through commercialization: they have a product, which they then patent and sell.”', 'Interestingly, the number of graduate students — those pursuing master’s degrees and PhDs — in biomedical fields has grown by 22% between 2018 and 2022, according to the NSF survey. And the number of predoctoral students funded by NIH fellowships has increased steadily since 1998.', 'Experts say these students are increasingly seeking out better paying industry jobs. Unlike academic positions, these roles don’t require postdoctoral research experience.', '“There’s no economic benefit (to doing a postdoctoral fellowship),” said Ginther. “If you spend four to six years in a postdoc and then jump into the industry, your starting salary is the same as if we would have just entered into industry automatically.”', 'The pay gap between academia and industry is also astronomical, which has the added effect of making corporate jobs much more financially attractive to students.', 'The NIH determines stipend amounts for US citizens in postdoctoral programs. The stipend for a first-year postdoc is roughly $56,000 per year, with marginal yearly wage increases. But in biotech, postdocs and PhD graduates can easily crack six figures.', 'Ginther served on an advisory committee to the NIH in December, where she and colleagues recommended the NIH increase their stipend amounts by 34% to $70,000 per year.', '“The NIH was waiting for its budget and that budget was passed a week ago, so I’m sure they’re having discussions about it right now,” she said. Ginther noted that the federal budget granted to the NIH was flat for fiscal year 2024, which “in a time with rising prices is actually a cut.”', 'The NIH told CNN on Monday that it is still considering the recommendations and the feasibility of implementing them.', 'Experts warn that the building blocks of life-saving scientific innovation may slowly erode. A new study from the World Health Organization found that Covid-19 vaccines saved the lives on 1.4 million people in Europe alone, reducing deaths by 57%. Healthcare experts estimate that in the 103 years insulin has been available to treat diabetes, the medication has saved tens of millions of lives. A lack of funding and meaningful wage increases for a critical part of the science workforce can hinder these medical discoveries across a range of public health battlefronts, from cancer to Alzheimer’s to the next pandemic.', 'This story has been updated with additional details.', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

Steady dealmaking coupled with a rebound in initial public offerings helped lift investor confidence and, with it, drugmaker stocks.', 'While that optimism has moderated somewhat since, a series of decisions by the Food and Drug Administration over the next three months could help the sector sustain its upturn. The agency may expand approvals for two cancer cell therapies and clear a third vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus. Sanofi and Regeneron await a decision on a lucrative new use for their top-selling Dupixent, while Geron could see decades of drug research finally pay off.', 'Here are five FDA decisions to watch in the second quarter.', 'The FDA this quarter could broaden the use of two cell therapies for multiple myeloma in decisions potentially worth billions of dollars to their respective developers.', 'By April 5, the agency will decide whether to clear Johnson & Johnson and Legend Biotech’s Carvykti for use in myeloma patients as early as after one relapse. That decision could be accompanied by a similar OK for Bristol Myers Squibb’s Abecma and open up use of the therapies, which are currently only available in the U.S. for people with more advanced disease.', 'European regulators have already endorsed earlier use of Abecma and Carvykti based on trial data showing they help people live longer without their disease progressing. But the FDA has appeared less supportive. The agency delayed a decision on Abecma last year and held a March advisory meeting to more closely scrutinize the data for it and Carvykti. In briefing documents, staff scientists flagged an apparent increase in the risk of death early on in the clinical trials of both therapies.', 'The companies attributed that finding to limitations in the “bridging therapies” study participants could receive while waiting for CAR-T treatment. Panelists were convinced and backed both, agreeing that those issues likely wouldn’t occur as frequently in practice.', 'Nonetheless, the regulatory scrutiny suggests that the FDA might put new safety restrictions on Carvykti and Abecma if it chooses to clear them for earlier use. — Jonathan Gardner', 'COVID-19 vaccine makers Pfizer and Moderna have been facing the downside of their pandemic success, as falling sales have brought tough questions from investors.', 'Moderna, for its part, aims to follow its COVID shot with several other messenger RNA-based vaccines, including one for respiratory syncytial virus that’s now under FDA review.', 'Respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, can cause severe illness\xa0in infants, older adults and people with compromised immune systems. Two vaccines, from GSK and Pfizer, are already approved to prevent RSV-related disease in adults over the age of 60. Sales of each have been strong, although GSK has established a clear edge.', 'Moderna argues its vaccine, dubbed mRNA-1345, can compete. The shot is a pre-filled, single-dose vaccine, potentially offering more convenient administration.', 'In Phase 3 testing, the vaccine was 84% effective at preventing infection with two or more symptoms in older adults. That efficacy does appear to wane over time, however.', 'At a recent meeting, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisers reviewed known safety risks for GSK’s and Pfizer’s shots, both of which were associated in very rare cases with Guillain-Barré syndrome, or GBS, a neurological condition affecting the nerves. Moderna has not reported any cases of GBS in Phase 3 testing of its shot.', 'An FDA decision on mRNA-1345 is set for May 12. — Delilah Alvarado', 'Drug development is a time-consuming, expensive process. Geron, a biotech founded 34 years ago to pursue stem cell research, knows this well.', 'The company’s long journey may finally reach an end by June 16, when the FDA will decide whether to approve a bone marrow disease drug Geron has been developing for nearly two decades. Called imetelstat, the drug treats myelodysplastic syndromes and some analysts believe it has blockbuster potential.', 'Over the many years of Geron’s research, imetelstat failed studies in multiple cancer types, and the company lost Johnson & Johnson as a partner along the way. But the drug finally succeeded in Phase 3 testing for myelodysplastic syndromes last year. And in March, it secured the endorsement of an FDA advisory panel despite skepticism from agency reviewers.', 'Geron aims to challenge Bristol Myers Squibb’s Reblozyl, first with a clearance in people with “lower-risk” disease and then in more people who have the condition. Stifel analyst Stephen Wiley estimated the drug could generate $2 billion in peak yearly sales, as it could be helpful in people who don’t respond well to Reblozyl.', 'Geron could be a buyout target, too, according to Wiley, though the company has said it plans to sell the drug on its own. — Ben Fidler', 'Dupixent is one of the pharmaceutical industry’s most widely used and lucrative products. Approved for asthma, eczema and three other inflammatory conditions, the drug earned the companies more than $11 billion in sales last year.', 'By June 27, the FDA could add another major indication to Dupixent’s list of approved uses. The regulator is currently reviewing the injectable medicine as a treatment for a type of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD.', 'If cleared by the FDA, Dupixent would be the first biologic drug for people with moderate-to-severe COPD who also have evidence of what’s called Type 2 inflammation. A pair of late-stage studies, which enrolled nearly 1,900 people, showed Dupixent could cut the rate of COPD attacks by about one-third. Analysts therefore expect the FDA to issue an approval and forecast billions of dollars in additional yearly sales. — Ned Pagliarulo', 'Some time during the second quarter, the FDA will decide whether to clear a gene therapy from Pfizer for hemophilia B, the less common form of the blood clotting disorder.', 'Reaching this point has been a long time coming for Pfizer, which licensed the therapy from Spark Therapeutics a decade ago. In subsequent testing, treatment\xa0lowered bleeding rates and reduced the need for regular blood transfusions — powerful benefits meant to last many years with a single infusion.', 'But it’s unclear whether Pfizer will find a market if the FDA chooses to approve its therapy. A rival genetic medicine, from CSL Behring and UniQure, won U.S. approval for hemophilia B in November 2022. However, few patients have been treated to date, sluggish uptake that could reflect the breadth of effective options available.', 'The story is similar with Roctavian, a gene therapy BioMarin Pharmaceutical sells for the more common “A” form of hemophilia. Only three patients received Roctavian last year: two in Germany and one in the U.S.', 'Pfizer’s therapy, which in January won Canadian approval, could provide another data point. But the company seems to be downplaying its potential. In recent presentations for investors, a once-weekly shot called marstacimab has gotten higher billing. — Ned Pagliarulo', 'This story was originally published on BioPharma Dive.

Investors may buy inexpensive stocks in hopes of seeing outsize long-term gains. That can often involve dealing with periods of stagnation or even decline, and sometimes, that payoff can take years.', 'In other cases, the payoff could occur more quickly, as investors saw with stocks like Nvidia and Super Micro, which have skyrocketed since the beginning of 2024. They may or may not have run their courses in the near term, but three other stocks have a high likelihood of ending the year higher.', ""Realty Income (NYSE: O) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns approximately 15,500 single-tenant commercial properties. It leases space to many of the nation's most prominent retail businesses, often buying their property and leasing it back to the former owner."", 'Moreover, the agreements are net leases. That means the tenant covers maintenance, taxes, and insurance costs.', 'Despite that benefit, the stock seems to have suffered because higher interest rates increase borrowing costs and, by extension, the cost of new deals.', 'Nonetheless, its monthly payout, which pays investors almost $3.08 per share annually, offers a dividend yield of 5.7%. Since the payout has risen at least once a year since 1994, the dividend increases will likely continue.', ""Additionally, Realty Income could see some relief on the interest rate front. After massive increases in past years, the Fed believes it will pass three interest rate cuts this year. This should lower Realty Income's borrowing costs, which could draw more investors into the stock."", 'Finally, its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 43 is on the lower end of its historical range, considering that the earnings multiple has exceeded 50 over most of the last five years. With that attractive entry point, investors should view Realty Income as a growth and income stock that should bring higher returns in 2024 and in the years to come.', 'Another REIT on the rebound is Innovative Industrial Properties (NYSE: IIPR) (IIP). IIP leases land and facilities to cannabis growers. As of the end of 2023, it owned 108 properties, or 8.9 million leasable square feet, in 19 U.S. states.', 'Like Realty Income, it buys a property and leases it back to the former owner. Since marijuana companies are barred from using the banking system, this gives them a ready source of cash while giving IIP a revenue stream.', 'IIP has also shown it can deal with adversity. The last downturn in the cannabis industry led to a rise in non-paying tenants. However, it was able to pivot, renegotiating terms on some leases, finding new tenants, or selling properties when it could not find an alternate solution.', 'It confirmed this strength late last year when it announced its first payout hike in five quarters. At $7.28 per share annually, its dividend yields 7%.', ""Also, IIP's stock has steadily marched higher since reaching a low last April, and its P/E ratio of 18 is near record lows. As cannabis sales improve and interest rates fall, bullish trends appear to be in place to take IIP higher, now and in the future."", 'Another strong income stock is IBM (NYSE: IBM). The company and its shares had stagnated for years as its tech businesses struggled to grow amid rising competition.', 'However, the paradigm changed when IBM bought Red Hat in 2019. The architect of that purchase, Arvind Krishna, became CEO soon after. He went on to acquire dozens of cloud-based businesses and spun off the managed infrastructure segment into Kyndryl.', ""Now, IBM is the world's sixth-largest cloud infrastructure provider.

Also, its generative AI platform, watsonx, positions the company to support artificial intelligence-driven applications for its customers, making it likely its cloud business will grow."", 'Additionally, with its $6.64-per-share annual dividend, IBM is one of the highest-yielding cloud stocks, with a dividend yield of 3.5%. If it chooses to hike the payout in April as it has in past years, it would mark the 29th consecutive year it has increased the dividend.', ""More investors have taken notice of IBM's value proposition. The stock is up nearly 50% over the last 12 months, taking it to near all-time highs.

To bring that message to life, we wanted to make the overall campaign really playful and inviting, as well as educational. It’s AI gone wrong, sure, but that doesn’t mean it’s scary or off-putting.

In value investing, investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound. There are a number of ratios to identify value stocks but none alone can conclusively determine their inherent potential. Each ratio helps an investor understand a particular aspect of the company’s business.One such ratio, Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF), can work wonders in stock picking if used prudently. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis — the lower the number, the better. Adtalem Global Education Inc. ATGE, General Motors Company GM, Unum Group UNM and KB Home KBH boast a low P/CF ratio.', 'You must be wondering why we are considering this when the most widely used valuation metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, an important factor that makes P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing a company’s financial health.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. Then again, cash flow is quite reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company generates and how effectively management is deploying the same.A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company’s liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, meet its expenses, reinvest in the business, endure downturns and finally undertake shareholder-friendly moves. Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which, in turn, lowers its flexibility to support these endeavors.However, an investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and take into account the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio.

The PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospects.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are four of the 15 stocks that qualified the screening:Adtalem Global Education, a national leader in post-secondary education and a leading provider of professional talent to the healthcare industry, sports a Zacks Rank #1 currently.

There are a number of investment styles for finding great stocks at attractive values.', 'While considering valuation metrics, though price-to-earnings and price-to-sales are the first choices, the P/B ratio is also emerging as a convenient tool for identifying low-priced stocks that have high-growth prospects.', 'Price-to-book ratio or P/B ratio is essentially the ratio of stock price to book value, i.e., how much an investor needs to pay for each dollar of the book value of a stock. It is calculated by dividing the current closing price of the stock by the book value per share.', 'Here’s the formula for P/B ratio:', 'P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equity.', 'The P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks with high growth prospects. General Motors Company GM, Unum Group UNM, KB Home KBH, Qifu Technology QFIN and Affiliated Managers Group AMG are some such stocks.', 'Now, let us understand the concept of book value.', 'There are several ways by which book value can be defined.\xa0Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.', 'It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.', 'By comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.', 'A P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value or the stock is undervalued and, therefore, a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.', 'For example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.', 'But there is a warning. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.', 'Moreover, the P/B ratio is not without limitations. It is useful for businesses like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.', 'In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.', 'Price to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.', 'Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.', 'Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share — a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.', 'PEG less than 1: PEG links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects.', 'Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.', 'Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.', 'Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.', 'Value Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.', 'Here are five of the 13 picks that qualified the screening:', 'Headquartered in Detroit,\xa0General Motors is one of the world’s largest automakers.

As Target takes aim at intriguing (and pretty creative) new growth drivers, I’m inclined to stay bullish on the stock as it looks to reposition itself in a better spot to take market share away from some of its big retail rivals.', 'With realistic (and quite conservative) expectations in place, it’s Target’s rivals that I believe will have the target on their back over the coming years as the retailer moves on after a forgettable few years that saw shares tank.', 'Undoubtedly, Target’s relative bout of underperformance isn’t entirely its fault. Though there’s some blame to bear on management’s part, there’s really no changing the fact that Target is more discretionary compared to many of its better-performing rivals — think Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Costco (NASDAQ:COST), which have thrived amid the hostile inflationary climate in recent years.', 'As inflation winds down, consumers heal and become more willing to splurge on the nice-to-haves; Target’s relatively light presence in the grocery section will no longer be a source of weakness. In essence, I expect a reheating up of the American economy to be a driving force for Target that could help it make up for lost time, perhaps at the expense of its more defensive rivals.', 'Either way, Target knows that it needs to improve its grocery game if it’s to survive the next period of economic sluggishness or scorching-hot inflation. As the Federal Reserve plays it “safe” (it’s not getting overly dovish, with only three interest rate cuts expected in 2024), I expect that it’s highly unlikely we’ll run into hot inflation again — that is, until the next black swan event brings forth the need for excessive money-printing.', 'In any case, Target has the desire to beef up its grocery presence and attract those looking to do their weekly grocery hauls.', ""“We were doing focus groups, and one of our guests said, ‘You know, I know Target sells food and beverage, but it kind of feels like an afterthought.'” said Target’s Executive Vice President Rick Gomez in a sitdown with CNBC."", 'Indeed, if Target is to take better aim at some of its better-performing rivals, it must prioritize becoming a primary destination for groceries, with its role as a discretionary retailer taking a secondary position.', 'As the economy begins to heat up, the key will be attracting consumers with competitively-priced food and necessities but getting them to stick around for discretionary goods. Costco has done a marvelous job of getting members to open their wallets for the must-haves and the nice-to-haves. Moving ahead, I think Target could begin to take a page out of the wholesale giant’s playbook as it bolsters its grocery business.', 'The good news is that Target has taken steps to jolt its grocery department by expanding its grocery section to more locations while also adding items to its private label Good & Gather. These days, lower-cost private labels have been like a secret weapon for retailers seeking to pocket sales and added margins to what would have otherwise gone to a third-party partner.', 'With around a fifth of overall sales coming from the Grocery segment, I’d argue that Target’s grocery segment has room to run and share to gain versus the likes of Walmart and Costco.', 'Target’s pivot into subscriptions could allow it to better compete with top rivals, most of whom have subscriptions of their own. Indeed, Target may be a tad late to the game with its Circle 360 membership. That said, given the impressive value proposition offered, I think it could draw in some loyal customers away from rivals. Indeed, shopping at Target can be a fun experience. And for those living close to a Target, a membership to Circle 360 may prove even more valuable than a Walmart+ membership.', 'Target’s subscription offering, which costs $99 annually, grants free delivery and, most intriguingly, rush (same-day) shipping. These days, consumer want their goods, they want them with free shipping, and they don’t want to have to wait too long.', 'In many ways, Circle 360 seems like a necessity for the modern era of retail, and I have no doubt it’ll be a success as Target looks to hit back at rivals.', 'On TipRanks, TGT stock comes in as a Moderate Buy. Out of 30 analyst ratings, there are 20 Buys and 10 Hold recommendations. The average TGT stock price target\xa0is $183.62, implying upside potential of 2.8%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $153 per share to a high of $206 per share.', 'As Target looks to finally even the playing field with its rivals, I think the recent relief rally could prove just the start. With an improving grocery presence, a new membership, and the potential for a healing consumer, I view Target stock as one of the bigger bargains in the retail scene right now. At 19.8 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E), it’s not a mystery why most analysts are bullish on the name.', 'Disclosure']"

Jeffrey's maintaining bullish on Target's renovation plans. Jeffrey's raising its price target on the stock to $205 from $195 as the healthy but cautious consumer is still spending. Let's bring in the analyst behind that call, a good friend of the show, Corey Tarlowe, who is the senior vice president of equity research over at Jefferies. Corey, good to see you here. Thanks for kicking off the second quarter with us. First, you got to take us into your thesis. What are you seeing at Target right now that gives you this optimism?"", ""COREY TARLOWE: Morning, and thanks so much for having me. So I think the most important thing to note here is that perhaps the tone around the health of the consumer in the US is changing. So I think for a good period of time, the narrative was the consumer is stretched, credit card balances are now over $1 trillion, she's prioritizing what she needs over what she wants."", ""But now I think what we're starting to see is with the moderation in inflation, maybe there's some normalization of mix now in the consumer's basket. So if she's going into a store with $100, and now things like fresh fish, dairy milk, eggs et cetera, some fruits and vegetables are lower in price, maybe that's freeing up some incremental dollars to buy general merchandise."", ""And so what we're starting to see now is an improvement in general merchandise in Target's business. And I think perhaps an improvement around tone for the broader consumer generally. So I think that these are some pretty bullish signs for Target and for the US consumer."", ""JARED BLIKRE: Well, you mentioned freeing up some cash here. What about for unit expansion, investing in the store in new locations? How do you see that playing out? And what's the strategy here?"", ""COREY TARLOWE: Sure. So Target has about 2,000 units today, and they're growing. So the company is going to be adding over the next 10 years an aggregate of 300 new units. A lot of them are going to be in this newer format. They're going to have integrations with beauty, partnerships with Apple, Disney, Levi's, et cetera to create excitement for the consumer. They'll have availability for Starbucks, same-day pickup."", 'So all of these things are likely to help to continue to drive traffic to Target stores, which should mean more customers, more benefits, greater sales, and even perhaps better margin too as people maybe go to the store and pick up Starbucks and then they add in some incremental apparel items, which by the way are higher margin.', ""So I think all of this bodes very well from a unit expansion standpoint, which tends to help drive sales. And one of the things that's really important to key in on here is retailers that are expanding units tend to also hold higher multiples as well. So it could be good for valuation ahead."", ""BRAD SMITH: Corey, you met with management from Target as well as Walmart. I mean, take us into the tone from both of these executive teams and what you're hearing from them right now."", 'COREY TARLOWE: Sure. So the tone overall is positive. I think starting grounding in my comments on the consumer being relatively healthier and more resilient than I think we had initially expected.

And private label, which is $100 billion plus business for Walmart is also deflationary. And specifically within private label, food and consumables private label is now running deflationary as well. So I think that this does bode really well for Walmart's private label business generally because it means that perhaps Walmart is going to be gaining more market share."", ""All the while, you're seeing more promotions or rollbacks on things like food and consumables, and these are vendor-funded.

These ideas represent companies that have increased their payout annually for at least 25 years. By nature, this is a cautious play but it’s never a bad idea to exercise some prudence.', 'Look, no one’s saying that investors should hit the panic button and not believe the incredible resilience the equities space has demonstrated. However, it’s also true that the smart money is diversifying its exposure. Recently, we saw a record outflow away from tech stocks. At the same time, there have been major moves into investment-grade bonds.', 'Again, this dynamic alone doesn’t justify a panicked response.

So, it’s not just one of the dividend aristocrat stocks – it’s a dividend king. Further, the payout ratio is relatively low at 41.74%. Therefore, investors won’t have to toss and turn at night regarding yield sustainability. Target more than likely has your back.', 'Per data from Yahoo Finance, I’m digging the recent financial performances.

Yes, that’s a bit lower than the utility sector’s average yield of 3.75%. However, because we’re dealing with a burgeoning market, this appears a trustworthy source of passive income.

Nevertheless, REITs generally tend to run a higher-than-average payout ratio compared to non-trust entities. Also, with a track record of 30 years of consecutive payout increases, Essex is hardly a fly-by-night operation.', 'Still, in exchange for the higher payout, investors must absorb a greater risk profile. In particular, the RETI’s Q4 earnings report was ugly, delivering EPS of $1.02 against an expected target of $1.46.

That’s just under the energy sector’s average yield of 4.24%. However, other factors play very much into CVX stock’s favor. For one thing, the payout ratio is relatively low at 45.28%, inspiring confidence regarding yield sustainability. More importantly, the company features a track record of 37 years of consecutive payout increases.', 'Overall, if you took away the clunker of an earnings performance in Q3, Chevron has more then held its own. Excepting Q3, the company’s average positive earnings surprise came out to 5.1%. For the current fiscal year, the average EPS target calls for $12.62, which is below last year’s print of $13.13.', 'However, the high-side estimate calls for $14.55.

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL)."", ""Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits."", ' See our latest analysis for Royal Caribbean Cruises ', 'The formula for return on equity is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Royal Caribbean Cruises is:', '35% = US$1.7b ÷ US$4.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.35 in profit."", 'One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Royal Caribbean Cruises has a superior ROE than the average (17%) in the Hospitality industry.', 'That is a good sign. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk. You can see the 2 risks we have identified for Royal Caribbean Cruises by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.', ""Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking."", ""It seems that Royal Caribbean Cruises uses a huge volume of debt to fund the business, since it has an extremely high debt to equity ratio of 4.30. While its ROE is no doubt quite impressive, it could give a false impression about the company's returns given that its huge debt could be boosting those returns."", 'Return on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.', ""Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company."", 'If you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.', 'Have feedback on this article?

Upstart's volume and revenue have been declining for several quarters, and profits have turned into losses."", 'Management has said it expected revenue to begin climbing again in the 2024 first quarter at about 20% year over year, which is still well below pre-pandemic levels. Management also expects the company to continue reporting net losses.', ""Upstart launched its first home-equity product last year targeting its largest market opportunity, mortgages. It's now live in 11 U.S. states, and it has some clear advantages over the standard process. For example, the average industry closing time is five weeks, and so far, Upstart's average is nine days."", ""It's hard to tell at this point what will happen. It certainly appears that Upstart's model is intact, and the business should bounce back and thrive when the Fed starts to cut interest rates. Even more, it's working to develop a suite of products that are countercyclical to reduce volatility during challenging economies."", ""But it will take time until that happens and the effects trickle down to Upstart's financials. It's also not a given that it will happen, and there are already challengers to its business model.

However, artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to do for businesses in this generation what the internet did for corporate America three decades ago.', 'By the turn of the decade, analysts at PwC foresee AI, which relies on software and systems in place of human oversight, increasing global gross domestic product by $15.7 trillion. No company has more directly benefited from the AI revolution than semiconductor stock Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA).', ""Over the span of 15 months, Nvidia's valuation has soared by $1.9 trillion to $2.26 trillion, which ranks behind only Microsoft and Apple among publicly traded companies in the U.S."", ""Nvidia's outperformance is a reflection of the overwhelming demand for its high-powered A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs). Some analysts believe Nvidia's top-tier chips could account for more than 90% of the GPUs deployed in AI-accelerated data centers this year. The early stage scarcity associated with these chips has afforded Nvidia exceptional pricing power."", 'But there are also plenty of reasons to believe Nvidia is in a bubble.', ""For example, every next-big-thing trend and innovation over the last three decades has worked its way through an early stage bubble. Investors have a habit of overestimating the adoption of new technology, and I don't anticipate AI being the exception."", ""Nvidia is also likely to see its pricing power wane in the quarters to come as new competitors enter the space and the company's own production reduces the scarcity of AI-GPUs. The bulk of Nvidia's 217% data-center sales growth in fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28, 2024) can be traced to its pricing power."", 'The chief concern might just be that its top four customers, which are ""Magnificent Seven"" constituents and comprise roughly 40% of its sales, are all developing in-house AI chips for their data centers. One way or another, Nvidia\'s orders from its top customers are liable to taper off in the quarters to come.', ""If history rhymes, once more, and the AI bubble bursts, Nvidia's market cap could crater (in context to where it is now) and allow other companies to leapfrog it."", 'Here are five companies -- not including Microsoft and Apple, which are already ahead of Nvidia -- which have the tools and intangibles to be worth more than Nvidia three years from now.', ""The first industry titan that shouldn't have any trouble surpassing Nvidia's market cap over the coming three years is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), the parent company of internet search engine Google, streaming platform YouTube, and autonomous-driving company Waymo, among other ventures."", ""The reason Alphabet would hold up substantially better than Nvidia if the AI bubble bursts is because it's a veritable monopoly in internet search. In March, Google accounted for more than 91% of worldwide internet search share. Looking back through nine years of monthly data from GlobalStats, Google hasn't ceded more than 10% of global internet search share to all other companies, combined. It's the clear-and-obvious choice for advertisers looking to get their message in front of users, and it's going to benefit immensely from long periods of domestic and international growth."", ""Google Cloud can also thrive if Nvidia stumbles. Enterprise cloud spending is still in its early innings, and Google Cloud has gobbled up a 10% share of worldwide cloud infrastructure service share, as of September 2023. Since cloud margins are traditionally juicier than advertising margins, Alphabet's cash flow growth may accelerate in the latter-half of the decade."", 'Like Alphabet, e-commerce juggernaut Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) can jump back ahead of Nvidia at some point over the next three years if the AI bubble deflates.', ""Most people are familiar with Amazon because of its world-leading online marketplace. In 2023, an estimated 38% of online retail spending in the U.S. was traced to its e-commerce site. But the real benefit of having more than 2 billion people visit Amazon's website each month is the advertising revenue it can generate, and the subscription revenue brought in via Prime. Amazon topped 200 million Prime users in April 2021, and has almost certainly added to this figure since becoming the exclusive streaming partner of Thursday Night Football."", ""However, Amazon's premier cash flow driver is its cloud infrastructure service platform. Despite accounting for a sixth of the company's net sales, Amazon Web Services (AWS) consistently generates 50% to 100% of Amazon's operating income. AWS is the world's top cloud infrastructure service platform by spend, per Canalys."", ""Even though social media company Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is betting on a future fueled by AI and augmented/virtual reality, the company's core operations should sustain double-digit earnings growth and help lift its valuation well past Nvidia come 2027."", 'Meta\'s ""secret sauce"" is no secret at all. Despite its metaverse ambitions and big spending at Reality Labs, the company\'s bread-and-butter continues to be its social media empire. It\'s the parent of the most-visited social site on the planet (Facebook), and collectively attracted just shy of 4 billion monthly active users during the December-ended quarter with its family of apps. Just as advertisers willingly pay a premium to Alphabet\'s Google because of its dominance in internet search, Meta\'s ad-pricing power tends to be superior in most economic climates.', 'The other reason Meta can shine and completely close the roughly $1 trillion valuation gap between it and Nvidia over the coming three years is its balance sheet. Meta is a cash-flow machine. It generated more than $71 billion in net cash from operations last year and closed out 2023 with $65.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Not only does this cash provide a buffer to the downside, but it affords Meta the luxury of taking chances that few other companies can match.', ""A fourth company that can surpass AI stock Nvidia's market cap over the course of the next three years is conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B). Since Warren Buffett took the reins at Berkshire Hathaway in the mid-1960s, he's overseen an annualized average return on his company's Class A shares that's approaching 20%!"", 'One of the primary reasons Berkshire Hathaway has been such a moneymaker for investors is the ""Oracle of Omaha\'s"" love of dividend stocks. Berkshire is on track to collect in the neighborhood of $6 billion in payouts this year, with just five core holdings accounting for almost $4.4 billion in aggregate dividend income. Since dividend-paying companies are often profitable on a recurring basis and time-tested, they\'re just the type of businesses we\'d expect to grow in lockstep with the U.S. economy over long periods.', ""Warren Buffett and his investment team also gravitate to brand-name businesses with trusted management teams. For instance, the $155 billion invested in Apple adds up to almost 42% of Berkshire Hathaway's invested assets. Apple is one of the world's most-valuable brands, and CEO Tim Cook has done a masterful job of leading ongoing physical product innovation while also pivoting the company to a subscription services-driven future."", ""The fifth stock that'll be worth more than artificial intelligence stock Nvidia three years from now is payment-processing behemoth Visa (NYSE: V). As things stand now, Visa will have to close a nearly $1.7 trillion valuation gap. But if the AI bubble pops and Visa keeps doing what it's been doing for decades, it can happen."", ""What makes Visa tick is the company's long runway of opportunity. It's the undisputed market share leader in credit card network purchase volume in the U.S. (the largest market for consumption globally), and has a multidecade opportunity to organically or acquisitively push its payment infrastructure into underbanked regions, such as the Middle East, Africa, and Southeastern Asia. Visa should be able to sustain a double-digit earnings growth rate throughout the remainder of the decade, if not well beyond."", ""Visa's other source of success is its relatively conservative management team. Although it would probably be wildly successful as a lender, its leaders have chosen to keep the company solely focused on payment facilitation. The advantage of this approach is that Visa doesn't have to set aside capital to cover loan losses during economic downturns since it's not a lender. The result is a profit margin that's consistently hovered at or above 50%!"", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Not only can you expect to receive a bigger dividend payment every year, but dividend growth stocks historically outperform the S&P 500.', 'One such stock that could prove to be a phenomenal dividend grower is T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS). Despite shares trading near their all-time high, they still look like a great value. The telecom stock sits on an increasingly strong cash position that can support its dividend growth for years to come.', ""When T-Mobile initiated its dividend last September, it included a note in the SEC filing indicating intentions to grow the amount paid per share by around 10% annually. So, despite the dividend yield of just 1.6%, investors' yield on their original investment could grow substantially over time."", ""In comparison, T-Mobile's telecom rivals have much higher yields, but their growth prospects are minimal. Verizon\xa0shares yield 6.5%, but investors can expect annual raises of about 5 cents per share, less than 2%. AT&T\xa0offers a similar yield, but its payment hasn't budged since it spun off and sold WarnerMedia."", 'Importantly, T-Mobile has the financial position to support 10% annual dividend growth for the foreseeable future. Along with its dividend, it announced a total capital return authorization of $19 billion, of which $16 billion remains as of the end of 2023. Only about $3 billion of that is going toward its dividend in 2024. That means T-Mobile could retire up to $13 billion in shares this year, which is about 7% of shares at its current price. That alone would get it more than halfway toward its annual 10% dividend increase without actually increasing the total amount spent on dividends.', ""Both AT&T and Verizon are busy servicing massive amounts of debt while staying committed to their big dividend payments, preventing them from committing to share repurchases. That's a much less flexible position to be in than T-Mobile, and it could ultimately prevent them from exhibiting the same level of operational growth."", ""The story at T-Mobile over the last few years has been its ability to leverage its spectrum position afforded by the merger with Sprint into a strong network. After investing heavily in building its network, it now has a fixed asset that's throwing off billions in cash."", ""Last year, the company generated $13.6 billion in free cash flow. It expects that number to climb to about $16.6 billion this year. That's thanks, in part, to lower capital expenditures, which it expects to come in at around $9 billion, at the bottom end of its $9 billion to $10 billion long-term forecast for annual spending. Still, strong revenue growth and improving operating margin are the key long-term drivers."", ""For reference, AT&T expects to generate between $17 billion and $18 billion in free cash flow this year. Verizon hasn't provided guidance on free cash flow for this year. It generated $18.7 billion last year."", ""T-Mobile has consistently led the industry in net postpaid subscriber additions, including the highly valuable postpaid phone subscribers. It's held average revenue per user steady while increasing revenue per account. That indicates more family plans, which are stickier. The result is slow and consistent growth in wireless service revenue."", ""That trend also shows up in its declining churn rate, which has come down considerably over the last few years. While T-Mobile has shown glimpses of its ability to produce better churn than AT&T and Verizon, its churn rate ended up higher than its rivals' in the fourth quarter. If T-Mobile consistently produces better churn rates than its rivals (which it appears on course to do), it could result in an even wider gap between its net additions and AT&T or Verizon."", ""T-Mobile shares currently trade for 11.5 times its 2024 free cash flow, based on management's outlook. Granted, that's a much higher multiple than AT&T (7 times free cash flow) and slightly higher than Verizon's.

She encourages employers to examine which employees are making use of benefit offerings and, if they’re not using them, explore better services that they’ll utilize.', 'Schelling also recommends relying on internal networks and communities, like employee resource groups (ERGs), to obtain candid feedback on benefits catering to specific demographics. She says Verizon often uses ERGs as focus groups to pilot new benefit offerings, host benefit fairs, and receive feedback on new services. Plus, the psychological safety and camaraderie provided in the groups help workers feel comfortable enough to speak transparently about the offerings and advertise new benefits through word of mouth, which is crucial since formal communication can only go so far, says Schelling.', 'Paige McGlauflinpaige.mcglauflin@fortune.com@paidion', ""Today's edition was curated by Emma Burleigh."", 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We can see that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) does use debt in its business. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky."", ""Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together."", ' Check out our latest analysis for NVIDIA ', 'You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that NVIDIA had US$9.71b of debt in January 2024, down from US$11.0b, one year before. However, its balance sheet shows it holds US$26.0b in cash, so it actually has US$16.3b net cash.', 'We can see from the most recent balance sheet that NVIDIA had liabilities of US$10.6b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$12.1b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$26.0b and US$10.00b worth of receivables due within a year. So it can boast US$13.2b more liquid assets than total liabilities.', ""This state of affairs indicates that NVIDIA's balance sheet looks quite solid, as its total liabilities are just about equal to its liquid assets. So it's very unlikely that the US$2.22t company is short on cash, but still worth keeping an eye on the balance sheet. Succinctly put, NVIDIA boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!"", 'Even more impressive was the fact that NVIDIA grew its EBIT by 489% over twelve months. That boost will make it even easier to pay down debt going forward. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if NVIDIA can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.', ""Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. NVIDIA may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. Over the last three years, NVIDIA recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 80% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect. That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt."", ""While we empathize with investors who find debt concerning, you should keep in mind that NVIDIA has net cash of US$16.3b, as well as more liquid assets than liabilities. And it impressed us with free cash flow of US$27b, being 80% of its EBIT. So is NVIDIA's debt a risk? It doesn't seem so to us. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for NVIDIA that you should be aware of before investing here."", ""If you're interested in investing in businesses that can grow profits without the burden of debt, then check out this free list of growing businesses that have net cash on the balance sheet."", 'Have feedback on this article?

Since the start of 2023, it has risen an amazing 520%. However, that's not surprising for a cyclical company like Nvidia."", ""Nvidia sells a product once and then must sell another to continue driving sales. This can lead to a boom-or-bust environment. While this has worked for many companies for hundreds of years, it's not as repeatable as a subscription model."", ""So if you're looking for stocks for the long term, consider these three that are riding the same wave as Nvidia."", ""Some of Nvidia's largest customers are those who own data centers used for cloud computing. Cloud computing is used by many companies that don't wish to maintain computing resources within the company. It involves renting computing power from cloud computing providers, which converts large upfront capital costs into recurring expenses. This is smart, as it keeps a business's capital light, allows it to scale easily, and doesn't come with the risk of buying technology that could be obsolete in a few years."", ""The largest cloud computing providers are Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), and they are massive buyers of Nvidia's primary product: graphics processing units (GPUs). Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet build massive data centers with computing power for their cloud computing clients. GPUs provide a lot of computing power in these data centers, as they can be utilized to crunch data, run engineering simulations, and train artificial intelligence (AI) models."", ""The use of GPUs for AI has recently sparked a lot of interest, as many companies are racing to develop and implement their AI models. This has caused a demand spike for Nvidia (for its GPUs) and the cloud computing providers (their easily rentable resources). The primary difference here is that Nvidia may sell its GPUs to one of the cloud computing providers or another end-user, but that's it. Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet charge their customers a monthly fee to utilize their resources."", ""This is key, as Nvidia has to hope the demand for its products keeps up; otherwise, its business could come crashing down. While I'm not saying that will happen soon for Nvidia, it has tended to get wrapped up in various bubbles (most recently, the cryptocurrency bust in 2018 and 2021) and end up with a vast supply of unwanted GPUs. This may happen again for AI-centric GPUs, or it may not."", ""As an illustration of Nvidia's cyclical nature, take a look at this graph, which shows how far its quarterly revenue declined from a previous high. (Note: The end value in the chart is 0% because they are currently all at their highest quarterly revenue of all time)."", 'Because Nvidia is prone to rising and falling demand, its revenue drops from its highs are much larger than those of Amazon, Microsoft, or Alphabet.', ""Regardless, it's much less certain than cloud computing, which is expected to massively grow. Grand View Research issued a report that stated the cloud computing market size was around $484 billion in 2022. But it expects it to massively increase to $1.55 trillion by 2030. That's a huge growing industry, and Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet are all set to capitalize on the growth."", 'Still, Nvidia will benefit from the buildout of data centers to run cloud computing. But once that initial sale is complete, the company will lose out on further revenue.', ""If you're curious about why subscriptions are better than one-time purchases, just look at the software industry."", ""Software companies figured out about a decade ago that locking clients into a subscription service is a much better business model. Clients have to make a painful choice if they break the subscription, as they'll lose access to the software altogether. Before this, customers could choose to upgrade to the newest software edition, which may include some new features. But it wasn't always required."", ""Now, nearly all software is subscription-based, and even basic products like Microsoft's Office suite have a subscription offering. Clearly, this business model has some advantages over a single sale."", ""While Nvidia may be fine, I'm more confident in Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet's ability to sustain their businesses over the long term due to their cloud computing segments. While these aren't the largest parts of their businesses, they are critical components that will provide consistent subscription revenue."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

However, Amazon generates more revenue than all of them, and yet its stock is the cheapest of the bunch. Here's why investors might regret not buying it when they look back on this moment in five years."", ""Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest cloud services platform in the world. It offers hundreds of solutions to help businesses store data, operate digital sales channels, develop software, and build AI applications. Amazon's goal is to have AWS dominate the three primary layers of AI."", ""The hardware layer comes first. Like most cloud providers, Amazon fills its data centers with Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) graphics processing units (GPUs), which are the most powerful in the industry when it comes to handling AI workloads."", 'However, Amazon also designs its own chips; it recently launched Trainium2, which is four times faster and twice as energy efficient as the original Trainium chip, allowing developers to train large language models (LLMs) far more quickly. LLMs sit at the foundation of popular consumer-facing applications like ChatGPT.', ""But some developers prefer to use existing LLMs so they can build AI applications more quickly. That's the second layer. AWS offers a variety of models, including its own called Titan and models from leading third parties like Anthropic, Meta Platforms, and Stability AI."", 'Ready-made applications are the third and final layer. AWS offers CodeWhisperer, which helps developers accelerate their programming. Then there is Amazon Q, a fully functional chatbot embedded in AWS. No two businesses are the same, so Q can be tailored to suit the tasks at hand to streamline projects, drive innovation, and speed up decision making.', 'In September 2023, Amazon and Anthropic announced a strategic partnership. Amazon would invest $4 billion in the start-up, of which the final $2.75 billion was transferred in March to close the deal. In exchange, Anthropic is helping Amazon accelerate penetration into the AI industry.', ""Anthropic is the creator of Claude, a generative AI chatbot. Its recent Claude 3 models reportedly outperformed competitors like OpenAI's GTP-4 models in most multimodal benchmarks. That means they are better at reasoning, solving math problems, answering complex questions, and generating content like computer code."", ""Anthropic will use AWS as its primary cloud provider. It will also train its future AI models on Amazon's chips, which could entice other leading developers to use them instead of Nvidia's hardware, which have become the default choice. Finally, Anthropic will make all of its models available on AWS for customers to use, which could be an advantage when developers are choosing a cloud provider."", ""Microsoft is the world's second-largest cloud provider, and it invested $10 billion in OpenAI last year. If Anthropic's Claude continues to outperform GPT-4, it could give Amazon and AWS the ultimate edge in the AI race."", 'Amazon generated $574 billion in revenue in 2023, which was more than any of its trillion-dollar peers. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) was the closest with $394 billion in sales during its fiscal 2023 year (ended Sept. 30, 2023).', ""Nevertheless, Amazon's market capitalization stands at $1.9 trillion, compared to Apple's $2.7 trillion. The price to sales (P/S) ratio divides a company's market cap by its annual revenue, so in this case Amazon's P/S ratio is 3.2."", 'As the below chart shows, Amazon stock is substantially cheaper than those of all of its trillion-dollar peers in the tech sector on a P/S basis, which includes Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet (Google).', ""Amazon's revenue grew by 12% in 2023, which was a faster rate of growth than Apple (2.8%) and Alphabet (9%), yet its stock trades at half their P/S ratio. Amazon generates less profit (relative to its revenue) because its e-commerce business operates on razor-thin margins, which is a key reason investors give it a lower valuation."", ""However, AWS specifically is highly profitable, with $24.6 billion in operating income on $90.7 billion in revenue last year. Here's the kicker: Most Wall Street forecasts suggest AI will have a multitrillion-dollar impact on the global economy. Plus, Cathie Wood's Ark Investment Management believes AI software companies will generate $14 trillion in revenue by 2030."", ""Therefore, AWS might be sitting on significant untapped potential.

Wall Street’s bull run got an added boost this year, to the surprise of a large section of financial pandits, who indiscriminately warned of overvaluation. Now, the question is, next what? We believe that the bulls will continue to roar, supported by a robust U.S. economy.', 'U.S. GDP rose 2.5% in 2023 compared with a 1.9% rise in 2022. At the beginning of 2023, the consensus estimate for full-year GDP was 2%. On Mar 29, the Atlanta Fed GDPNow tracker forecast a 2.3% growth rate for first-quarter 2024, indicating no chance of a near-term recession. Moreover, the Fed raised the U.S. GDP forecast for 2024 to 2.1% in the March FOMC meeting from 1.4% in December 2023.', 'The core PCE inflation rate (excluding volatile food and energy items) — Fed’s favorite inflation gauge — rose 0.3% month over month in February compared with 0.5% in the previous month. Year over year, core PCE inflation rose 2.8% in February compared with 2.9% in January. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that the data was in line with the central bank’s expectations.', 'Peak inflation is far behind us. The labor market remains resilient. Moreover, personal consumption expenditure — the largest driver of the GDP — increased 0.8% month over month in February, compared with the consensus estimate of 0.5% and a 0.2% increase in January.', 'The ongoing tech rally since the beginning of 2023 was led by a massive thrust toward artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI. The rapid penetration of digital technologies and the Internet worldwide during the lockdown period, ushered in significant adoption of AI.', 'We believe the AI space is yet to unfold in the United States and international markets. Once that happens, it will generate huge business opportunities for technology companies producing high-end products.', 'Smart devices need computing and learning capabilities to perform face detection, image recognition and video analytics capabilities. These require high processing power, speed and memory, low power consumption, and better graphic processors and solutions, which bode well for the AI-powered semiconductor industry.', 'The first-quarter 2024 earnings season will kick off within two weeks. Wall Street is set to see a positive earnings season for three quarters in a row. Total S&P 500 earnings for the first quarter of 2024 are expected to be up 2.5% from the same period last year on 3.5% higher revenues.', 'This follows the 6.7% year-over-year earnings growth on 3.9% higher revenues in fourth-quarter 2023 and 3.8% year-over-year earnings growth on 2.1% higher revenues in third-quarter 2023.', 'On Mar 20, after the FOMC meeting, the Fed kept the benchmark lending rate constant in the range of 5.25-5.5%. The range of the Fed fund rate has been steady since July 2023.', 'However, the Fed’s latest “dot-plot” (a closely watched matrix of anonymous projections from the 19 officials who comprise the FOMC) shows the benchmark lending rate coming down to 4.625% at mid-point by the end of 2024. The existing mid-point of the Fed fund rate is 5.375%. This indicates three rate cuts of 25 basis points each.', 'Despite higher valuation, the tech rally is likely to gather more pace in 2024 as a low market rate of interest always boosts growth stocks like technology. We have narrowed our search to five technology behemoths (market capital > $100 billion) that have provided double-digit returns year to date. These companies have a robust business model, a solid financial position and globally acclaimed brand value.', 'These stocks have strong growth potential for 2024 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days.

The stock price of NVDA has soared 82.5% year to date.', 'Meta Platforms Inc. is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement with its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. META is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook.', 'META’s innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2 and Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3, is likely to aid growth. Reels continue to do very well across Instagram and Facebook. People reshared Reels 3.5 billion times every day during the fourth quarter.', 'Zacks Rank #1 Meta Platforms has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 17.7% and 34.1%, respectively, for the current year.

Using AI and analytics, MU has produced hardware with increased storage capacity, faster memory, and high-quality data filtering.', 'The expectation of supply normalization by mid-year 2024 is likely to drive pricing, while the boom in AI spending is expected to fuel demand for MU’s chips in the data center end market. Additionally, 5G adoption in the IoT devices and wireless infrastructure is likely to spur demand for MU’s memory and storage.', 'Zacks Rank #2 Micron Technology has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 55.6% and more than 100%, respectively, for the current year (ending August 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved more than 100% over the last 30 days. The stock price of MU has jumped 38.2% year to date.', 'Microsoft Corp. is riding on strong growth from Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes. Intelligent Cloud revenues are driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services. MSFT’s Productivity and Business Processes revenues continue to increase due to the strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions.', 'Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings, as well as a rise in revenue per user, are drivers of top-line growth. MSFT got off to an early lead in the generative AI race, thanks to its work with OpenAI. The general availability of Copilot for Security holds promises. We expect fiscal 2024 net sales to grow 14.6% from fiscal 2023.', 'Zacks Rank #2 Microsoft has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 15% and 18.6%, respectively, for the current year (ending June 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.3% over the last 60 days. The stock price of MSFT has rallied 11.9% year to date.', 'Amazon.com Inc. has benefited from Prime and AWS’ momentum. The strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate have contributed to the performance of AMZN. Ultrafast delivery services and an expanding content portfolio have been beneficial. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers have also favored the company. AMZN’s robust advertising business has contributed as well.', 'Notably, improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home product offerings continue to act as a tailwind. AMZN’s strong global presence and solid momentum among small and medium businesses remain positive. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are the other catalysts. Also, its deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus.', 'Zacks Rank #2 Amazon has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.6% and 40.7%, respectively, for the current year.

Having said that, we might get a better idea of what's going on with the stock by looking at other metrics."", ""We note that the dividend has remained healthy, so that wouldn't really explain the share price drop.

The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock.

It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend.

Brent oil, the global benchmark, rose nearly 14%, while WTI, which tracks U.S. crude, surged approximately 16% during the quarter. On Thursday — the last trading day of the quarter — the global benchmark settled at $87.48 per barrel, while U.S. crude closed at $83.17 a barrel.Several factors contributed to the uptrend in oil prices. One significant driver was the ongoing production cut by major oil-producing nations, including Russia and members of the OPEC cartel. These cuts helped tighten the supply-demand dynamics in the market, leading to a reduction in global oil inventories.While uncertainties persist, particularly regarding geopolitical risks and supply dynamics, analysts remain optimistic about the potential for further price gains in the crude market. Some oil-related stocks that could benefit in the current environment include Murphy USA MUSA, Sunoco LP SUN and Helmerich & Payne HP.', 'Since 2022, OPEC+ countries, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, have implemented various production cuts to support oil prices as the market grapples with rising U.S. production and sluggish global demand. The latest round of voluntary cuts, which began in January, aimed to reduce combined production targets by approximately 2.2 million barrels per day (bpd).Last month, Saudi Arabia confirmed the decision to extend the voluntary cuts until the end of June. In a surprising move, Russia announced an additional voluntary cut of 471,000 bpd for the second quarter. This decision, along with the commitment from other key producers like Iraq and the UAE to extend their cuts, underscores the collective effort to stabilize oil markets.Geopolitical tensions also played a role in supporting oil prices. Escalating conflicts, such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Palestine conflict, raised concerns about potential supply disruptions in key oil-producing regions. Additionally, attacks on ships in the Red Sea further heightened market anxieties, contributing to the bullish sentiment.', ""Despite concerns over robust U.S. production, oil prices remained resilient, supported by expectations of sustained demand and ongoing supply constraints. Looking ahead, market participants will closely monitor developments related to OPEC's production policies. While the alliance has extended its output cuts until the end of June, any signs of member countries deviating from these agreements could impact market sentiment. Moreover, geopolitical events and economic indicators will continue to influence oil prices in the coming months.To conclude, the overall sentiment on oil prices seems to be leaning toward the bullish side, with the OPEC production cut putting a floor under prices."", 'Some of the best energy stocks to take advantage of the opportunities in the market include Murphy USA, Sunoco LP and Helmerich & Payne.

When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We can see that Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) does use debt in its business. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky."", ""Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together."", ' See our latest analysis for Devon Energy ', 'You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Devon Energy had US$6.16b of debt in December 2023, down from US$6.44b, one year before. However, it does have US$853.0m in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$5.30b.', 'We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Devon Energy had liabilities of US$2.95b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$9.32b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$853.0m in cash and US$1.57b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$9.85b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.', 'While this might seem like a lot, it is not so bad since Devon Energy has a huge market capitalization of US$31.8b, and so it could probably strengthen its balance sheet by raising capital if it needed to. However, it is still worthwhile taking a close look at its ability to pay off debt.', 'We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.', ""Devon Energy has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.71. And its EBIT easily covers its interest expense, being 15.6 times the size. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The modesty of its debt load may become crucial for Devon Energy if management cannot prevent a repeat of the 39% cut to EBIT over the last year. When a company sees its earnings tank, it can sometimes find its relationships with its lenders turn sour. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Devon Energy can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting."", ""Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, Devon Energy recorded free cash flow worth 55% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to."", ""Based on what we've seen Devon Energy is not finding it easy, given its EBIT growth rate, but the other factors we considered give us cause to be optimistic. There's no doubt that its ability to to cover its interest expense with its EBIT is pretty flash. Looking at all this data makes us feel a little cautious about Devon Energy's debt levels. While we appreciate debt can enhance returns on equity, we'd suggest that shareholders keep close watch on its debt levels, lest they increase. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. For example Devon Energy has   3 warning signs  (and 1 which shouldn't be ignored)  we think you should know about."", ""Of course, if you're the type of investor who prefers buying stocks without the burden of debt, then don't hesitate to discover our exclusive list of net cash growth stocks, today."", 'Have feedback on this article?

At least it does if you believe analysts at Wells Fargo, who just raised the price target on Devon Energy stock to $59 from $46 previously and upgraded the stock to ""overweight"" from ""equal weight.""', ""One reason for the upgrade is enthusiasm for the company's capital allocation plan and focus on its core assets in the Delaware Basin (straddling west Texas and New Mexico). Devon Energy is allocating 60% of its $3.3 billion to $3.6 billion capital allocation in 2024 to the Delaware basin."", ""The analyst believes that Devon's drilling activity in these assets in early 2024 will improve well efficiency. It's a view shared by management, as its 2024 plan calls for its investment in drilling in the Delaware Basin to improve well productivity by up to 10%."", 'As previously discussed, the company has a good track record of expanding production and making extensions and discoveries to its resources.', ""If the analyst is correct, Devon Energy will be an even more attractive stock. The current production rate and free cash flow generation imply a significant return to investors (either by share buybacks or dividends) in 2024. By my calculations and management's estimates (including returning of 70% of cash flow to investors), Devon Energy could return up to 6.7% of its market cap in share buybacks and dividends this year."", ""It's understandable if investors focus on the dividend, but the reality is management is willing to prioritize share buybacks depending on the valuation."", 'A reduced share count is good news for investors because it increases their share of a claim on future cash flows from the company. In addition, if Devon continues to grow its resources and well productivity, and the price of oil stays at about $80 a barrel, investors can expect significantly more dividends in the future.

Moreover, PSA’s technological advancements and healthy balance sheet are commendable. Its sustainable dividend payouts make it an attractive investment option.However, softening in demand and operating trends is a key concern. The development boom of self-storage units in many markets is likely to intensify competition and curb pricing power. High interest rates add to its woes.', ""Public Storage is one of the top owners and operators of storage facilities. The brand stands out as one of the most recognized and established names in the self-storage industry. With a significant market presence in major metropolitan centers, the company is poised to capitalize on the economies of scale apart from benefiting from its brand recognition. PSA is leveraging technology for revenue optimization and cost efficiencies and, as such, has invested in technologies over the past few years.In addition, Public Storage has been capitalizing on growth opportunities. In September 2023, it acquired Simply Self Storage from BREIT for $2.2 billion. From the beginning of 2021, the company acquired a total of 470 facilities with 38.8 million net rentable square feet for $8.5 billion.As of Dec 31, 2023, the company had various facilities in development and expansion, which are expected to add 3.6 million net rentable square feet at an estimated cost of $766.2 million. Public Storage expects $500 million in acquisitions and $450 million in development openings in 2024. With solid access to capital, the company is well-poised to take advantage of a potential opportunity.PSA maintains a strong financial profile characterized by solid credit metrics, including low leverage relative to its total capitalization and operating cash flows. The company concluded 2023 with a net debt and preferred equity to EBITDA of 3.9X and an EBITDA to fixed-charge coverage of 8.3 times. It also enjoys an “A” credit rating from Standard & Poor’s and an “A2” from Moody’s.The sturdy credit profile and ratings enable the company to access both public and private capital markets to raise capital at favorable rates. As such, the company seems well-poised to take advantage of any potential opportunity.Furthermore, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for investment in REIT stocks. Public Storage has consistently paid its dividends. While the company has increased its dividend two times in the past five years, encouragingly, its payout has grown 8.12% over the same time period. Looking at the company’s operating environment and financial position compared to that of the industry’s average, its current dividend is expected to be sustainable in the upcoming period.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have increased 1.7% over the past month against its industry's decline of 0.8%. Analysts seem bullish regarding PSA’s FFO growth prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company's 2024 FFO per share has been revised marginally upward over the past week."", 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'The self-storage industry continued to experience softening in demand and operating trends through 2023, and this trend is expected to continue in 2024. Particularly, the industry-wide demand from new customers for storage space at the beginning of 2024 was below the level at the beginning of 2023.Tenants are reverting to more normal move-out behavior with the abatement of the pandemic, and there is upward pressure on vacate trends. To lure tenants into such an environment, management continues to focus on lowering rental rates to new customers and increasing promotional discounting.Consequently, same-store revenues are likely to be affected, and we estimate only a 0.9% increase in this metric in 2024. Also, we project 2024 weighted average square foot occupancy to be 92.8%, down from 93.3% recorded in 2023.A high interest rate is a concern for Public Storage. Elevated rates imply higher borrowing costs for the company, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate. The company has a substantial debt burden, and its total debt as of Dec 31, 2023 was approximately $9.1 billion.

AMZN.', 'U.S. stock markets witnessed an impressive first quarter of 2024 after an astonishing 2023. Wall Street’s bull run got an added boost this year, to the surprise of a large section of financial pandits, who indiscriminately warned of overvaluation. Now, the question is, next what? We believe that the bulls will continue to roar, supported by a robust U.S. economy.', 'U.S. GDP rose 2.5% in 2023 compared with a 1.9% rise in 2022. At the beginning of 2023, the consensus estimate for full-year GDP was 2%. On Mar 29, the Atlanta Fed GDPNow tracker forecast a 2.3% growth rate for first-quarter 2024, indicating no chance of a near-term recession. Moreover, the Fed raised the U.S. GDP forecast for 2024 to 2.1% in the March FOMC meeting from 1.4% in December 2023.', 'The core PCE inflation rate (excluding volatile food and energy items) — Fed’s favorite inflation gauge — rose 0.3% month over month in February compared with 0.5% in the previous month. Year over year, core PCE inflation rose 2.8% in February compared with 2.9% in January. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that the data was in line with the central bank’s expectations.', 'Peak inflation is far behind us. The labor market remains resilient. Moreover, personal consumption expenditure — the largest driver of the GDP — increased 0.8% month over month in February, compared with the consensus estimate of 0.5% and a 0.2% increase in January.', 'The ongoing tech rally since the beginning of 2023 was led by a massive thrust toward artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI. The rapid penetration of digital technologies and the Internet worldwide during the lockdown period, ushered in significant adoption of AI.', 'We believe the AI space is yet to unfold in the United States and international markets. Once that happens, it will generate huge business opportunities for technology companies producing high-end products.', 'Smart devices need computing and learning capabilities to perform face detection, image recognition and video analytics capabilities. These require high processing power, speed and memory, low power consumption, and better graphic processors and solutions, which bode well for the AI-powered semiconductor industry.', 'The first-quarter 2024 earnings season will kick off within two weeks. Wall Street is set to see a positive earnings season for three quarters in a row. Total S&P 500 earnings for the first quarter of 2024 are expected to be up 2.5% from the same period last year on 3.5% higher revenues.', 'This follows the 6.7% year-over-year earnings growth on 3.9% higher revenues in fourth-quarter 2023 and 3.8% year-over-year earnings growth on 2.1% higher revenues in third-quarter 2023.', 'On Mar 20, after the FOMC meeting, the Fed kept the benchmark lending rate constant in the range of 5.25-5.5%. The range of the Fed fund rate has been steady since July 2023.', 'However, the Fed’s latest “dot-plot” (a closely watched matrix of anonymous projections from the 19 officials who comprise the FOMC) shows the benchmark lending rate coming down to 4.625% at mid-point by the end of 2024. The existing mid-point of the Fed fund rate is 5.375%. This indicates three rate cuts of 25 basis points each.', 'Despite higher valuation, the tech rally is likely to gather more pace in 2024 as a low market rate of interest always boosts growth stocks like technology. We have narrowed our search to five technology behemoths (market capital > $100 billion) that have provided double-digit returns year to date. These companies have a robust business model, a solid financial position and globally acclaimed brand value.', 'These stocks have strong growth potential for 2024 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Finally, each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.', 'NVIDIA Corp.’s Compute & Networking revenues are gaining from the strong growth of AI, high-performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures.', 'A surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds for NVDA. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance NVDA’s presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.', 'Zacks Rank #1 NVIDIA has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 72.6% and 84%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days. The stock price of NVDA has soared 82.5% year to date.', 'Meta Platforms Inc. is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement with its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. META is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook.', 'META’s innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2 and Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3, is likely to aid growth. Reels continue to do very well across Instagram and Facebook. People reshared Reels 3.5 billion times every day during the fourth quarter.', 'Zacks Rank #1 Meta Platforms has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 17.7% and 34.1%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.6% over the last 60 days. The stock price of META has climbed 37.2% year to date.', 'Micron Technology Inc. has enhanced its chip packages with AI, machine learning and deep learning. Using AI and analytics, MU has produced hardware with increased storage capacity, faster memory, and high-quality data filtering.', 'The expectation of supply normalization by mid-year 2024 is likely to drive pricing, while the boom in AI spending is expected to fuel demand for MU’s chips in the data center end market. Additionally, 5G adoption in the IoT devices and wireless infrastructure is likely to spur demand for MU’s memory and storage.', 'Zacks Rank #2 Micron Technology has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 55.6% and more than 100%, respectively, for the current year (ending August 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved more than 100% over the last 30 days. The stock price of MU has jumped 38.2% year to date.', 'Microsoft Corp. is riding on strong growth from Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes. Intelligent Cloud revenues are driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services. MSFT’s Productivity and Business Processes revenues continue to increase due to the strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions.', 'Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings, as well as a rise in revenue per user, are drivers of top-line growth. MSFT got off to an early lead in the generative AI race, thanks to its work with OpenAI. The general availability of Copilot for Security holds promises. We expect fiscal 2024 net sales to grow 14.6% from fiscal 2023.', 'Zacks Rank #2 Microsoft has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 15% and 18.6%, respectively, for the current year (ending June 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.3% over the last 60 days. The stock price of MSFT has rallied 11.9% year to date.', 'Amazon.com Inc. has benefited from Prime and AWS’ momentum. The strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate have contributed to the performance of AMZN. Ultrafast delivery services and an expanding content portfolio have been beneficial. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers have also favored the company. AMZN’s robust advertising business has contributed as well.', 'Notably, improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home product offerings continue to act as a tailwind. AMZN’s strong global presence and solid momentum among small and medium businesses remain positive. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are the other catalysts. Also, its deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus.', 'Zacks Rank #2 Amazon has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.6% and 40.7%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.5% over the last 30 days.

Its solutions are used in leading-edge computing, consumer, networking and mobile products.A major portion of the revenues is derived from DRAM sales. The company's mission is to be the most efficient and innovative global provider of semiconductor memory solutions.Micron reported revenues of $15.54 billion in fiscal 2023. The company has four reportable segments:Compute and Networking Business Unit (CNBU): The unit comprises of DRAM and NOR Flash products that are sold to the computer, networking, graphics, and cloud server markets, and NAND Flash products which are sold into the networking market. CNBU delivered revenues of $5.71 billion (37% of total revenues) in fiscal 2023.Mobile Business Unit (MBU): The unit comprises Micron’s discrete DRAM, discrete NAND and managed NAND (including eMMC and universal flash storage (UFS) solutions) products that are sold to smartphone and other mobile-device markets. MBU generated revenues of $3.63 billion (23%) in fiscal 2023.Storage Business Unit (SBU): The unit accounts for solid state drives (SSDs) and component-level solutions sold into enterprise and cloud, client and consumer storage markets as well as other discrete storage products sold in component and wafer forms to the removable storage markets. SBU’s revenues grossed $2.55 billion (16%) in fiscal 2023.Embedded Business Unit (EBU): The unit includes Micron’s discrete DRAM, discrete NAND, managed NAND and NOR products, which are sold to the automotive, industrial and consumer markets.

Now, fast food chains that have at least 60 locations nationwide now need to raise their minimum wage for restaurant employees to $20 per hour. That's up from $16 per hour. Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma has all the details. Brooke."", 'BROOKE DIPALMA: Good morning to you both. I mean, certainly, this is just impacting fast food companies that have a nationwide presence more than 60 locations. But they will only be raising their minimum wages based upon this legislation in California. Does go into effect in that state today, raising that minimum wage to $20 an hour. But this has been looming for so many restaurants that have a big presence in California.', ""And those with the largest include names that we go to, that we visit, that we talk about almost every day like Starbucks, like McDonald's, Jack in the Box, Taco Bell, Subway, among so many others. And companies really here had two options. They could either absorb that wage increase like Cava did. Or they could pass along higher prices like Chipotle suggested that they would choose to do."", ""But companies that are better positioned to withstand this latest headwind include companies that have strong branding power, strong value proposition, and a diverse geographic footprint. And some of those companies you could see that we're flying through now, Wendy's, McDonald's, Burger King, they tend to have a better position to withstand this latest wage increase in California because of their sheer scale. That's a plus with national and international locations."", ""Chipotle has this strong value proposition where you can get a $9 burrito bowl with chicken in it across the country. And they also have good traffic. As of late, Wingstop has really been ramping up their brand awareness. This will put them in a better position. And Domino's, they have what one analyst calls an unbeatable low price pizza deal that will ultimately help them with this latest wage increase."", 'But Jack in the Box, they have about 43% of their restaurants. In California 60% of their subsidiary, Del Taco locations are in California. And also their diners tend to SKU lower income. And we know that is one income cohort that has been slightly pulling back at fast food restaurants as of late. So they are not as best positioned there. Not worse position, but definitely going to face some struggle here to offset that higher minimum wage cost.', ""MADISON MILLS: So Brooke, given that this is coming in an inflationary time period where restaurants have already been trying to find ways to beef up their profit margins, I'm curious what your sources have told you about any job cuts that could come off the back of this news."", ""BROOKE DIPALMA: Yeah. Well, I did speak to one franchise owner who said that this will cost him 470,000 additional dollars annually. And so he has to let go some workers. That's what he's choosing to do. He even said that he might pull out of California entirely. He is a franchise owner of Cinnabon and Auntie Anne's. Whereas other analysts have told me that job losses, they don't expect it to be widespread."", ""They said that restaurants are just returning to those pre-pandemic staffing levels. And so they don't want to necessarily cut jobs that they just got back. But what we could see here is how does automation play into all this? Will companies be upping the investment? Because when you think about $20 an hour, how does that compare to the cost to invest in technology to implement automation to offset the labor costs. Right now as wages increase, we're seeing that cost sort of level out here."", 'JARED BLIKRE: Arms race.', 'BROOKE DIPALMA: Yeah.', 'JARED BLIKRE: Definitely.', ""MADISON MILLS: Yeah. That's a great point, Brooke.""]"

I mean, certainly, this is just impacting fast food companies that have a nationwide presence more than 60 locations.

Or they could pass along higher prices like Chipotle suggested that they would choose to do."", ""But companies that are better positioned to withstand this latest headwind include companies that have strong branding power, strong value proposition, and a diverse geographic footprint. And some of those companies you could see that we're flying through now, Wendy's, McDonald's, Burger King, they tend to have a better position to withstand this latest wage increase in California because of their sheer scale. That's a plus with national and international locations."", ""Chipotle has this strong value proposition where you can get a $9 burrito bowl with chicken in it across the country.

In California 60% of their subsidiary, Del Taco locations are in California. And also their diners tend to SKU lower income.

Well, I did speak to one franchise owner who said that this will cost him 470,000 additional dollars annually. And so he has to let go some workers. That's what he's choosing to do.

Instead, investors should focus on the company's base business and valuation to make an investment decision."", 'Here is what you need to know.', ""The announcement came after a test run of about 160 stores in the Louisville, Kentucky, area. McDonald's will roll the donuts out to all U.S. stores by 2026, featuring three flavors: glazed, frosted, and Kreme-filled. This could boost traffic during breakfast hours. McDonald's has emphasized its coffee products and has experimented with 24-hour breakfast. It's a clear sign that management is trying to grow here."", ""A boost in donut sales will trickle back to McDonald's as sales royalties, but the overall financial impact of this partnership is probably overstated. For one, McDonald's gets 38% of its revenue from the rent that franchisees pay the company. Next, it will be a gradual rollout that will take a couple of years to complete. The financial impact will likely be minimal for a while yet."", ""Investors can still applaud the partnership and showing a willingness to experiment to attract consumers.

Despite the discount, I'm not sure McDonald's is an obvious buy."", ""Growth must be factored into a stock's valuation to give investors the whole picture. I like using the PEG ratio for this purpose. At a PEG ratio of 3, McDonald's stock is still expensive for its expected earnings growth, which analysts believe will average 7% to 8% annually over the next three to five years."", ""The company's balance sheet is why I don't find McDonald's valuation attractive enough despite its discount to historical norms. The company has repurchased a ton of stock, lowering the share count by more than 26% over the past 10 years. To accomplish that, McDonald's had to borrow money at times, which has steadily leveraged the company to 2.6 times its EBITDA."", ""I don't think McDonald's is fundamentally weakened at its current debt level -- this is manageable. But I also don't expect McDonald's to be able to replicate its actions over the past decade. There isn't enough room to borrow money like that again. Earnings growth will likely be slower moving forward than it was with the repurchases, which warrants a lower valuation."", ""That said, McDonald's is a fantastic stock that investors can buy and hold forever while sleeping well at night.

It does great in all economies because its tenants are recession-proof. People still need gasoline and grab a quick meal on the go during good and bad times.', ""The company has a long track record of dividend growth to support this. Management has paid and raised the dividend for 35 consecutive years. It's also has a tempting 5% yield at today's share price. The dividend is cushioned by a manageable 64% dividend payout ratio, based on FFO."", 'You own NNN REIT for its stable, high-yield dividend, not for its growth. Analysts believe its FFO will grow at a low-single-digit percentage pace over the long term, warranting a low valuation, which today is 13 times FFO. Consider this REIT if you want to earn low-stress passive income.', 'Public Storage (NYSE: PSA) owns 3,300 self-storage centers across the U.S. Unlike many REITs, it also operates and manages the properties.', ""The cool thing about Public Storage is that it can easily adjust its customer pricing. It has more than 2 two million customers, and the average tenant stays seven to 10 months -- a good thing as long as turnover isn't too high."", ""The company isn't a traditional dividend growth stock. Management has paid a special dividend before and doesn't raise its quarterly dividend yearly, but that doesn't necessarily mean the dividend is in trouble. The payout ratio is a healthy 67% of FFO, and investors get a yield of more than 4% at the current share price."", ""Analysts forecast FFO growth in the low to mid single-digit percentages in the coming years. It's another REIT that won't blow your socks off with growth but it will provide steady income for your portfolio and peace of mind.

We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing."", ""As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in ResMed. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see ResMed's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story."", ""Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. ResMed is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 12%. With 8.4% and 4.4% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders."", 'A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.', 'While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.', 'The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.', 'Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.', 'Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of ResMed Inc.. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$255m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying.

While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run."", ""I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company.

If you want to see more such stocks on the list, go directly to\xa0Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 5 Stocks with Rising Price Targets.', 'Stocks and bonds experienced losses on April 1 as expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut diminished, prompting Wall Street traders to react. The decline in bond prices was particularly notable, with Treasury yields rising across the board, including a significant increase of over 10 basis points in 10-year yields. This shift came as a surprise, driven by robust US factory data indicating the first expansion in manufacturing activity since September 2022, coupled with a rise in input costs. The unexpected expansion in manufacturing activity signaled strength in the US economy, leading to speculation that the Federal Reserve may delay or refrain from implementing interest rate cuts. Consequently, the market recalibrated its expectations, with the amount of anticipated Fed easing priced into swap contracts for the year dropping to approximately 65 basis points, which was lower than what had been anticipated by Fed policymakers. In response to these developments, both stocks and bonds faced downward pressure. Despite the S&P 500 recently achieving its fifth consecutive month of gains, equities declined as traders adjusted their positions based on the evolving economic landscape and expectations regarding Federal Reserve policy. This reaction underscores the sensitivity of financial markets to shifts in economic data and central bank signals, highlighting the importance of monitoring forthcoming updates from Fed speakers for further insights into monetary policy direction.', 'As investors reflect on the remarkable performance of the S&P 500 Index in the first quarter of the year, they are now turning their attention to the uncertain path ahead, contemplating whether stocks will continue their ascent or face a sudden downturn. According to Bloomberg, as the second quarter commences with the stock market reaching unprecedented highs, clues about market sentiment can be gleaned from the options market. Notably, the demand for put options, which provide a payout in the event of a minor market correction, is at its lowest level in years. This suggests that investors are less concerned about modest downward movements in stock prices. However, beneath the surface, traders are quietly hedging against extreme scenarios by acquiring tail-risk hedges. These instruments may offer little protection in the event of a slight market dip but are designed to provide substantial safeguarding if stocks experience significant volatility or a sharp downturn. The prevalence of these tail-risk hedges reflects a growing apprehension among investors about the potential for unforeseen and dramatic market events, commonly referred to as ""black swan"" events. This cautious approach underscores the uncertainty surrounding market dynamics and the desire among investors to shield their portfolios from potential downside risks amidst the current market environment. On the stock market front, analysts are bullish on stocks such as The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG) and Wayfair Inc. (NYSE:W)\xa0among many others.

This adjustment reflects Oppenheimer's positive sentiment towards Pool Corp.'s prospects and performance within the industry. Following investor meetings with Pool Corp.'s CFO, Melanie Hart, after the company's well-received Investor Day, Oppenheimer maintained its Outperform rating on the shares. The firm believes that Pool Corporation (NASDAQ:POOL), as an industry leader, is well positioned to capitalize on several key factors driving demand in the U.S. in-ground pool market. These factors include the continuous growth in the installed base of pools, the need for renovation of existing pools, and the ongoing demand for recurring pool maintenance services. During the meetings, Pool Corporation (NASDAQ:POOL) showcased its strategic investments in technology aimed at driving incremental revenue. Notably, the company highlighted advancements in its Pool360 mobile ordering platform, incorporating new digital innovations to enhance the customer experience and streamline operations. Oppenheimer views these technological initiatives as key drivers of future growth for Pool Corp. Furthermore, Oppenheimer projects that Pool Corporation (NASDAQ:POOL) will experience a return to adjusted earnings per share (EPS) growth in 2024, following a trough in 2023 after elevated growth from 2020 to 2022. This expectation underscores Oppenheimer's confidence in Pool Corporation (NASDAQ:POOL) ability to navigate challenges and capitalize on opportunities within the pool and leisure industry. As a result of Oppenheimer's positive assessment and price target increase, investors reacted positively, driving Pool Corporation (NASDAQ:POOL) stock price up by 8% to $436 on March 28.

According to the firm's analysis, this transition is expected to open up new avenues for growth that offer significantly higher profitability than conventional food retail operations. Over time, the firm anticipates that this shift will enhance The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) overall profit profile. Expanding on the details, Kroger's move towards a food-first model entails a strategic emphasis on expanding its offerings beyond traditional grocery items. This could include initiatives such as enhancing its prepared foods selection, expanding its organic and health-focused product lines, and investing in digital innovation to improve the shopping experience. The food retail industry, within which The Kroger Co.

Dollar General, a discount retail chain in the US, has dealt with a few struggles. The retailer had previously benefited from COVID stimulus checks, reflected in the bump it experienced in revenues and margins. However, the effects have worn off, and its core consumer has been hurt by inflation, stiffer economic conditions, lower tax refunds and reduced SNAP benefits. Margins are also under pressure due to labor costs, shrink and markdowns. Some of the issues are likely self-inflicted. After years of focusing on store growth to drive the top line, store standards have suffered. Addressing store standards is needed to turn around flagging traffic, comps and customer satisfaction. On the positive side, discount retail due to its trade-down feature tends to be a defensive business during economic slowdowns. Dollar General has a strong market position and faces less competition than other discounters due to its largely rural footprint. The business’s value proposition is everyday low prices, a convenient format and proximity. The company has leverage due to capital expenditures, but interest coverage of ~9X is strong. From a valuation perspective, the froth from the pandemic, when it traded in the low- to mid-twenties, is gone. So, we aren’t paying for margin upside or store growth. Those would be bonuses.

Carbon capture is a relatively young science."", ""Just as the name suggests, carbon capture refers to the extraction of carbon dioxide gas that would otherwise make its way into the atmosphere, where it can contribute to global warming. Sometimes this captured CO2 is put back into the ground where it doesn't cause problems for the environment. Other times, it can be utilized to create chemicals, make plastics, and even improve the production of oil and natural gas wells."", ""There's a handful of ways of capturing this carbon dioxide. Some of them are implemented right at the source of creation, like filtering it out of whatever normally spews from a power plant's smokestack. Other approaches simply remove it from ambient air. All of them work to varying degrees. As you can imagine, though, this technology isn't cheap. That's why it's still relatively uncommon. But the cost is coming down."", 'Enter Aker Carbon Capture. The Norwegian company\'s ""Just Catch"" systems are capable of extracting 95% of the CO2 found in industrial exhaust -- up to 400,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year -- before it\'s ever released into the atmosphere.', ""There are two ways the company's technology can be monetized. One of them is the outright sale of Aker's Just Catch and similar systems. The other way is allowing Aker to extract the CO2 being created at a particular facility, and paying the service provider on the basis of the weight of carbon dioxide it captures. Both business models are marketable, and increasingly so as the world regulates its way toward a zero-carbon future."", ""Seeing this inevitability on the horizon, SLB (which you may know better as Schlumberger) is simply positioning itself now to capitalize on a key part of the energy industry's future."", ""Great, but what does any of this have to do with Occidental? It's simple -- the company's already in the carbon capture business. Indeed, it built what was then the world's biggest carbon capture facility back in 2010, only to shutter that site in order to erect an even bigger and more efficient direct-air carbon-capture facility in Ector County, Texas. This so-called STRATOS project will be capable of capturing up to 500,000 metric tons of CO2 per year."", ""That isn't much more than the annual capture capacity of one of Aker's biggest carbon capture systems. STRATOS is much more flexible, though, in that it's able to extract carbon dioxide from the air regardless of how and where that CO2 entered it. This approach still satisfies the growing legal requirements that companies take responsibility for their carbon footprint by removing much of the carbon dioxide they ultimately create."", ""In this vein, Amazon, Airbus, and a couple of professional sports teams are already signed up as future paying customers. CEO Vicki Hollub thinks Occidental's carbon capture customer count could reach 1,000 when all is said and done."", ""Occidental Petroleum's potential as a carbon-capture service provider is augmented by its efforts to find ways of doing something constructive with this captured carbon dioxide gas. It's been using CO2 to improve oil and gas well yields since the 1980s. And it's partnered with biotech company Cemvita in finding ways to use CO2 as the basis for the creation of industrial chemicals and polymers."", ""Occidental's upside to the removal of carbon dioxide is twofold. First (and most obviously), there's money to be made with this tech, either by outright selling carbon capture systems or performing the work on behalf of companies that want to punt such duties to qualified experts."", ""Given its young age, the size and potential revenue of the carbon capture and carbon-storage market remains a bit fuzzy. To the extent reasonable guesses can be made, Global Market Insights suggests this business that's worth $7 billion a year now will grow to an annual business of around $35 billion by 2032. Those numbers jibe with outlooks from Spherical Insights as well as Precedence Research. Environmentally minded regulatory requirements will be driving the vast majority of this growth."", ""The other upside for Occidental Petroleum is less obvious -- until it's plainly pointed out. That is, if fossil fuels' prospective harm to the environment can be negated, the use of oil and natural gas can continue on well into the foreseeable future."", ""And that's no small matter."", ""See, for all the efforts that have been made to create environmentally friendly renewable sources of energy, these still only account for a minority of the world's total power production. The United States' Energy Information Administration reports that petroleum is still at the heart of about one-third of the country's total power consumption, while natural gas makes up another one-third. Moreover, Standard & Poor's believes that even as far down the road as 2050 that petroleum will still be the world's single-biggest source of energy."", ""While the need is already great and still growing, the world can't afford to simply let the CO2 from that power production continue entering the atmosphere."", ""Given all of this, Warren Buffett's continued interest in energy stocks in general -- and Occidental Petroleum in particular -- suddenly makes much more sense."", 'As Buffett explained of Berkshire Hathaway\'s 244 million-share position in Occidental in his latest annual letter to Berkshire shareholders, ""We particularly like its vast oil and gas holdings in the United States, as well as its leadership in carbon-capture initiatives."" That\'s a rather specific mention from someone who tends to focus on the bigger picture rather than the smaller details. The fact that Buffett made a point of pointing out Occidental\'s work on the carbon capture front at all illustrates just how important this tech is -- if not right now, then at least soon. Underscoring Buffett\'s message is the fact that SLB is now ramping up its investment in the very same arena.', 'So, take the hint.

Today, it looks like June is the more likely scenario. It is still expected that the Federal Reserve will enact three rate cuts in 2024 but the shift has limited the perception of monetary easing this year. That means more stocks have now become stocks to sell.', 'The longer rates remain higher the more difficulty companies will have. Firms rely on financing and the interest is largely dictated by the FED funds rate. Thus, rate cuts result in lower interest payments making business models more tenable overall.', 'Growth stocks are particularly affected. Lower rates spur larger investment by which such firms can chase higher growth rates. such firms looked much better months ago when it was expected that rate cuts would be enacted earlier. That is just one of many narratives below to consider in relation to stocks to sell.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: silicaetran / Shutterstock.com', 'ContextLogic (NASDAQ:WISH) is a stock that investors should sell or avoid for many reasons. In relation to limited monetary easing it is one to sell because the consumer continues to weaken.', 'Economists have struggled to accurately predict consumer behavior as the FED has tightened monetary policy. Those economists have continuously predicted that consumers will revolt due to higher prices. As a result, retail spending has continuously been predicted to fall. Yet, the consumer has remained stubborn and bucked those predictions again and again. Economists are again predicting that retail spending will decline due to the Fed’s decision to hold rates steady.', 'That’s actually more of a reason to avoid retail stocks. ContextLogic Is one such choice but the reasons to avoid it are much bigger. The company recently announced plans to sell its e-commerce platform. investors, for some reason, believe that it will rejuvenate the company. Maybe it will, maybe it won’t. However, if the company couldn’t operate that platform profitably, why should investors then believe it will be able to operate another business successfully?', 'Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com', 'AMC Holdings (NYSE:AMC) is a stock that is a little more than a pull of a slot machine: it can make you some money but odds are that it will end up costing you. That is the simple truth of the matter for the ailing movie theater operator.', 'It became popular for memes but the underlying business is troubled. Investors should remember that\xa0 above all else.', 'The company lost nearly $400 million during the most recent year. It did so even as sales increased by 23%. Those sales will not continue to grow at that rate but AMC will continue to lose money.', 'AMC has tried a lot of things to change its fortunes. Some of them, like investing in a gold mining company, made no sense at all in relation to its business. Others, like its recent decision to sell its popcorn through grocery stores make more sense. Will it be enough to return the company to profitability? Almost certainly not. Point being, it will continue to be a pull of the slot machine that will burn more people than it will reward.', 'Source: chanpipat / Shutterstock.com', 'Commercial real estate stocks including Vornado Realty (NYSE:VNO) are facing headwinds from multiple directions.', 'Higher interest rates have spiked Delinquency rates making it more difficult for the commercial operators to pay their bills in turn. It’s a vicious cycle that tends to cascade across commercial real estate as rates rise.', 'It has been evident that Vornado Realty is one such troubled firm: the company suspended its dividend almost a year ago. Most investors place their capital in REITs for their dividends. So, when Vornado Realty suspended its dividend for 2023 things were bad.', 'The company’s fourth quarter earnings report shows a company that is in preservation mode. While the company managed toReduce losses this year it continues to struggle. Frankly speaking, the earnings report is convoluted and difficult to understand. That’s probably intentional. Whether it is or isn’t, the small amount of profitability the company showed was mostly due to clever accounting.', 'Source: shutterstock.com/Pla2na', 'Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) is one of the more prominent covid era stocks that boomed and consequently went bust. The short success of the company was obviously due to the shuttering of gyms. It was also a consequence of monetary easing. Consumers, flush with stimulus cash, could afford subscriptions and expensive exercise bikes.', 'In any case, Peloton was once very hot and now it is struggling to survive.', 'The problem is that Peloton really doesn’t have the revenue opportunities that it once did. the company has looked too many possible Avenues to rejuvenate Its Top Line, most recently B2B subscriptions. It won’t matter because the company continues to burn through several hundred million dollars of cash for every quarter. Sooner or later the company will need to raise more cash through financing or through an issuance of additional shares. Both of those outcomes are negative and will push share prices lower which is another reason to sell PTON shares.', 'Source: jossnat / Shutterstock', 'There’s no arguing that there’s a lot to like about Crowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD)\xa0 and its stock.

The demand for secure endpoints is very clearly strong. Add to that the fact that Crowdstrike recently announced a strategic collaboration with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and its prospects seem to only brighten.', 'However, Crowdstrike is overpriced. take a look at its P/E ratio, for example. Its earnings are more expensive than 99% of the software sector. Further, the company continues to struggle in relation to capital returns. In fact, its Investments end up losing money which is a considerable problem given that the cost of capital averages more than 9% for the firm.', 'Source: MMD Creative / Shutterstock.com', 'C3.ai (NYSE:AI) stock would certainly benefit from earlier monetary easing as would most every other growth stock. The longer those cuts take to arrive the worse its outlook becomes.', 'That truth is part of the bigger picture which includes many reasons to sell AI stock.\xa0 I’d assert that the biggest reason to get rid of C3.ai is its continued lack of profitability. Remember, the stock was hammered in September of last year when it withdrew previous guidance for non-GAAP profitability by the end of fiscal year 2024.', 'The company continues to produce losses whether by GAAP standards or non-GAAP standards. Rate cuts would help the company just as they would help any other by decreasing the costs of lending. However, I’m not sure that that’s the biggest issue. Instead, I think it’s more about the fact that the company is overhyped as an enterprise AI firm. There’s a lot of skepticism around AI stock which is evident in the fact that nearly 1/3 of its shares are sold short.', 'Source: Smile Fight / Shuttterstock.com', 'Arguably the biggest reason to avoid Lucid (NASDAQ:LCID) stock stems from its delivery outlook for this year. High interest rates aren’t aren’t far behind given how much money the company loses: it could certainly benefit from lower interest rates.', 'Let’s start by looking at those deliveries. Lucid delivered 8,423 vehicles in all of 2023. That resulted in losses approaching $3 billion for the year. Unfortunately, the company has also given guidance that it expects to produce 9,000 vehicles in all of 2024. It’s highly likely then that the company will continue to rack up losses into the billions of dollars this year.', 'The company ended the most recent period with $4.78 billion in liquidity. That suggests that the company can pretty comfortably make it through 2024 without raising more capital. That’s important in relation to current interest rates.

Other senior executives are leaving the company immediately, including Stan Deal, president of the company’s commercial airplane unit. Boeing board chair Larry Kellner won’t stand for reelection. The leadership shake-up is the latest upheaval at the troubled commercial aircraft manufacturer, and the turmoil at Boeing is directly impacting other airline stocks.', 'Boeing has been dealing with a crisis of confidence since a door plug on one of its aircraft blew off mid-flight in January. Since then, Boeing has come under intense scrutiny from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Congress and Wall Street. Audits and inspections have revealed lax safety protocols and other troubling findings that could put air passengers at risk. Consequently, BA stock has fallen 25% this year, putting its five-year decline at 50%.', 'While things have been bad at Boeing, the problems have also spilled over to the airlines that are the company’s customers. These airlines rely on Boeing’s planes to stock their fleets and keep them updated. Compounding problems for the airlines is the fact that there is only one other commercial aircraft manufacturer in the entire world, Airbus (EPA:AIR) of France.

United said that it expects a loss of 35 cents to 85 cents per share due to the grounding of Boeing MAX 9 aircraft. United’s management team said they’ve been forced to cancel 11% of their scheduled flights since the Boeing door plug incident occurred at the start of the year.', 'Source: Sugrit Jiranarak / Shutterstock.com', 'Alaska Air Group (NYSE:ALK) was the carrier operating the Boeing aircraft when the door plug blew off mid-flight, leaving a gaping hole next to a row of passengers and causing a viral internet sensation. To say its publicity has been bad is an understatement. ALK stock had been struggling before the incident happened in early January. Now, the company’s share price is trading almost 30% lower than where it was five years ago.', 'Like United Airlines, Alaska Air Group operates a large fleet of Boeing aircraft. In fact, its entire fleet is made up of Boeing 737 series aircraft that are now being scrutinized over safety concerns. As passengers across America switch flights to avoid Boeing aircraft, it is having a material impact on Alaska Air’s operations and earnings. If all this weren’t enough, the FBI is now investigating the January door plug incident as a crime.', 'Source: GagliardiPhotography / Shutterstock.com', 'When one of only two commercial aircraft manufacturers in the world experiences major problems and delays, it causes headaches at American Airlines (NYSE:AAL). The largest carrier in the world, American Airlines operates a fleet of almost 1,000 aircraft, nearly all of them made by Boeing and Airbus. American needs to constantly update its fleet, removing older airplanes and replacing them with newer models.', 'In early March, American Airlines placed its biggest airplane order since 2011, buying 85 new jets each from Airbus and Boeing, as well as 90 aircraft from Brazil’s Embraer (NYSE:ERJ). The big order comes as American Airlines tries to capitalize on booming demand for air travel, particularly premium travel.

An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change.', ""The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system."", 'The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.', 'As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Sherwin-Williams is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.', 'Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices', ""The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock."", ""Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Sherwin-Williams imply an improvement in the company's underlying business.

Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating.
