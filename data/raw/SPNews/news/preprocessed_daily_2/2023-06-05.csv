For more IoT stocks, head on over to 5 Internet of Things (IoT) Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On. As a technology, the consumer use of the Internet is entering its fourth decade. And over the past forty odd years, it has evolved quite a bit. If you're old enough, you'd remember that connecting to the Internet in the 1990s and the early 2000s required using a dialup modem with its familiar tune of signals being sent to a network to establish a connection.The era of broadband, which came roughly around the same time as the smartphone, and the growth in WiFi devices marked the first major shift in internet use. Consumers were no longer limited either to their desks or to slow speeds to access the web, and as a result, the kinds of applications and data that could be used grew exponentially. This growth came a little while before 3G internet smartphones provided high speed internet right into a consumer's hands, and the subsequent proliferation of dongles enabled anyone with a laptop to access the Internet as long as there was a supportive telecommunications tower in sight.Settling into the 2020s, it's all about two main technologies in the Internet scene. These are fifth generation (5G) telecommunications networks and low Earth orbit (LEO) internet satellites. With the latter, you can access the net anywhere on the planet as long as there are satellites orbiting and you have the right equipment such as a dish. With the former, the opportunity for a multi billion dollar industry is at the doorstep of countless firms.This industry is the Internet of Things (IoT) industry. Starting off with the basics, the global IoT industry was worth $399 billion in 2022 and will grow to be worth $486 billion in 2023. From then until 2027, the sector is expected to grow at a whopping compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21.4% to be worth an estimated $1 trillion by the end of the forecast period according to research from The Business Research Company. The research firm adds that Asia Pacific was the largest segment of the IoT market - unsurprising as we'll find out later when we delve deeper into its myriad of use cases. The Business Research Company adds that automotive use is a major industry to utilize IoT gadgets, and collectively the gadgets will provide companies with vast amounts of data to sift through to generate analytical insights.Story continuesOne key sector that is vastly expected to benefit from IoT devices is the industrial segment. This area involves using machines to manufacture products on a large scale, and the use of IoT gadgets enables manufacturing managers to catch errors, consolidate and gather new data, and ensure real time monitoring of the factory line. Therefore, it's unsurprising that the industrial Internet of Things industry is quite lucrative.  A research report from Grand View Research shows that this area was worth $321 billion in 2022 and will grow at a CAGR of 23.2% from this year until the end of the decade to be worth $1.6 trillion. Within industrial IoT use, the manufacturing segment commanded an 18% market share in 2022 and will continue to be the largest portion moving forward. In terms of growth rate, the logistics segment is anticipated to outpace the broader market and exhibit a CAGR of 24%.Yet, these estimates are only representative of what money the IoT companies will make. But what about the value they will generate? On this front, McKinsey has some rather stunning estimates. It believes that by 2030, IoT could enable users to deliver an absolute eye popping $12.6 trillion in value - nearly ten times the revenue that IoT companies will generate according to some estimates. The factory segment will account for 26% of this value generation, and healthcare use is expected to come in second place at a best case 14% share. Additionally, and as is the case with most high technology industries (another example being biotechnology), the developed world is estimated to hold the lion's share (55%) of this value.Rounding off our analysis by taking a look at the situation on the ground, management of smart lighting and other equipment maker Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE:AYI) shared during its second quarter of 2023 earnings conference:With our product vitality and service efforts, we make products that deserve to be chosen and our independent sales agents ensure that they are chosen. Product vitality is driving success across our portfolio and during NEXT 23, we introduced several new products. I want to highlight a couple here. The first was the new nLight AIR System Input Device. This is an indoor controller that can be used in multiple spaces, including office, commercial and retail. The device converts analog outputs to wireless broadcast to control intelligent luminaires. This reduces the need for complex wiring solutions during installation and reduces the associated cost for the customer. The second was the nLight AIR rPOD Micro. This is a battery-powered wall switch that can be used as a traditional wall switch or as a remote, providing control from anywhere within a build space.This is a really exciting extension of the technology and an elegant response to our customers’ need for flexibility. These and other products continue to gain market attention. This quarter, several of our architectural lighting brands, A-Light, Eureka and Luminis, won a total of eight Good Design Awards from the Chicago Athenaeum which recognizes products and industry leaders in design and manufacturing that have chartered new directions for innovation. Now moving to our Intelligent Spaces Group. The spaces team continued to perform well, delivering another quarter of solid sales and operating profit growth, driven by the continued success of Distech. Distech is winning because we have the best digital control solutions in the market. It’s technology is open protocol which means you can connect our controller to most new or existing systems in a build space, giving our customers significant flexibility.With these details in mind, let's take a look at hot IoT stocks finding favor from billionaires, out of which the top ones are DexCom, Inc.

With that being the case, investors are looking for bargains amid a rising market. In other words, it’s a good time to consider beaten-down stocks for long-term gains.Uncertain economic times can cause people to fear investing in the market. And a fair number of storm clouds are on the horizon today. But ultimately, it is time in the market that drives a huge chunk of returns. By investing in beaten-down stocks, people can still have their capital at work without taking as much risk as in high-flying and potentially overvalued stocks.These are the three top beaten-down stocks today.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsJD.com (JD)JD.com (JD) logo displayed at the entrance to the company's Silicon Valley office.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comJD.com (NASDAQ:JD) is the perfect company to own for a potential massive long-term gain. The Chinese e-commerce giant has grown tremendously since going public nearly a decade ago. Just since 2018, revenues have been up from $67 billion to $152 billion last year.The Chinese economy has suffered from a prolonged slowdown amid continuing COVID-19 restrictions. The lockdowns initially bolstered the prospects of e-commerce firms such as JD, but that momentum has faded over the past year.Regardless, the company continues to grow, with analysts forecasting 4% revenue growth this year and a return to double-dip top-line gains in 2024. That makes JD stock an outright bargain, as shares sell for just 12 times forward earnings today. Founder Richard Liu has returned to a more hands-on role at JD to help the company thrive in the post-pandemic landscape as well.MetLife (MET)A close-up shot of a hand choosing wooden blocks with emoticons on little wooden tiles symbolizing types of health insuranceSource: ShutterstockMetLife (NYSE:MET) is one of America’s largest insurance companies. Like many financial companies, MET stock has come under fire in 2023; shares are down nearly 30% year-to-date. With that decline, MetLife shares are trading back to the same levels we saw 15 years ago.Story continuesInvestors are worried about interest rates. Due to soaring interest rates, life insurers, including MetLife, have unrealized losses on their securities portfolios.However, insurance companies aren’t banks. People don’t pull their money out of insurance in the same way that they can move money instantly out of banks. The truth is that insurance companies are designed to invest on a decades-long time horizon to match their assets against future life insurance liabilities.In fact, much higher interest rates are a net positive for MetLife since the insurer can put new capital to work at far higher rates. MetLife should see much higher profitability in future years thanks to the current disruption. With the recent stock price decline, MetLife sells for just six times forward earnings and offers a 4.0% dividend yield.Endava (DAVA)Close up of phone with creative forex chart on blue background.

Tech Stocks to Buy Before the Bull Market ReturnsSource: Golden Dayz / Shutterstock.comEndava (NYSE:DAVA) is a leading information technology solutions company focused on the financial industry. Given the painful correction we’ve seen in banking and insurance stocks in 2023, understandably, investors are dumping the IT consultants for the banks as well.However, things have gotten out of hand. For DAVA stock specifically, shares are down from a peak of $170 to around $55. This is incredible. Endava is debt-free and highly profitable; there’s no wipeout risk here.Not only that, Endava is continuing to show rapid growth. In its fiscal Q3 earnings report this week, Endava saw revenues surge 20%. Earnings per share rose from 48 pence to 59 pence per share. These are not the figures one usually sees when a company’s stock has lost two-thirds of its value.Endava shares are now going for 20 times the estimated 2023 years and 18 and 15 times the estimated 2024 and 2025 earnings, respectively. Buying a tech company with double-digit revenue and earnings growth at such a low starting multiple is rare. Once concerns around banks’ IT budgets subside, Endava should enjoy a strong recovery.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in DAVA stock.

U.S. 2-year Treasury yields nudged higher to 3.75% on Monday.Soundings from China's service sector earlier helped partly to offset fears that dour factory readings questioned its post-COVID recovery. European equivalents were more downbeat.Story continuesAs midyear investment outlooks stream in, Morgan Stanley's global take sees developed market government bonds, Asia equities and the dollar all outperforming over the remainder of the year - but it spotlighted ""front loaded"" risk to growth, earnings and policy that make it something of a ""crunch time"".Elsewhere, U.S. regulators are preparing to tighten rules for large banks, which could raise their capital requirements by 20% on average after a spate of midsize bank failures this year, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday.Turkey's lira slid almost 1% on Monday to weaken past 21 per dollar, in a shaky initial reaction to the appointment of highly-regarded Mehmet Simsek as finance minister.Events to watch for later on Monday:* U.S. ISM and S&amp;P Global May service sector surveys, April factory goods orders* European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde speaks to European Parliament; Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester speaks at conference opening* U.S. Treasury auctions 3- and 6-month bills(By Mike Dolan, editing by Sharon Singleton; mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com.

And for most market goers, that means watching the action on the Yahoo Finance app (which I strongly encourage you to download) from a beach, a park, or a pool.While the natural inclination is to ""sell in May and go away,"" I humbly say: please don't do that. Not just because we have bills to pay here, but because there is a litany of interesting stories to track in the markets. I would argue there are many more compelling stories for investors compared to Summer 2022.Here is a tiny sampling of things I am watching during a summer that probably won't involve me going to a beach, pool, or house party because well — investing ""stuff"" is all I got going for me. The order is totally random and not in order of importance.1. Target's stockShares have been hammered by close to 14% in the past two weeks since the company removed LGBTQ+ merchandise from its stores. The fear is consumer backlash means weakening sales and a missed second quarter. The company also caught a JP Morgan downgrade on concerns the restart of student loan payments in Sept. 1 will hurt sales.Unclear if there is a near-term catalyst to jumpstart Target's stock considering all of this, which comes after another tough quarter of sales.2. The economic impact of student loan repaymentsThe downgrade to Target's stock could be a canary-in-the-coal-mine indicator of what analysts and market strategists do this summer before the repayments begin. Are more retailer ratings cut? Do strategists trim their S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates and year-end price targets? How will markets react? The market reaction to the Target downgrade was modest, but can it continue?Story continuesMake no mistake, the payment restart will be a headwind for an economy that doesn't need one.Goldman Sachs estimates student loan repayments will subtract 0.2 percentage points from personal consumption expenditures growth this year if the loan forgiveness plan is struck down, or 0.1 percentage point if the plan stands.Jefferies economist Thomas Simons thinks at least $400 a month in spending capacity will be removed from the pockets of those with student loans.""So as we're now adding this back in to balance sheets that are already pretty strained by two years of very high inflation that's run significantly higher than wage growth, the capacity to absorb this in a lot of budgets I think is much worse now,"" Simons said on Yahoo Finance Live.3. AI StocksIt's time for investors to draw a differentiation in AI stocks. Not doing so could prove very painful to one's portfolio.On the one hand, you have credible companies infusing generative AI into their businesses to unlock efficiencies and win new business. I was very impressed by what HP CEO Enrique Lores told me about how AI will transform the personal computer starting in 2024. With that, the company and rival Dell could be winners of a PC refresh cycle in 2024.I was also surprised to learn from Hewlett Packard Enterprise CFO Tarek Robbiati that the company has secured $800 million in new AI-related business.I fancy we may hear something positive very soon from AMD on the generative AI front. Maybe not as Earth-shattering as Nvidia, but strong enough to excite investors.Salesforce has an AI investor day slated a week from today. And Cisco Live is underway in Las Vegas — AI discussions will probably be front and center here.Again, these are credible companies working on cool AI stuff for the benefit of investors.On the other end of the spectrum, you have companies such as c3.AI.The money-losing company is being attacked by short sellers —such as the super-thorough Ben Axler at Spruce Point— for suspect accounting standards. I think many on the Street are beginning to drill down into the fundamentals of these more fringe AI plays to avoid getting burned —much like when the SPAC bubble burst.I expect a summer of AI scrutiny, leading to a possible rotation into more credible AI stocks.4. Apple's stockApple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) kicks off today (our tech editor Dan Howley will have full live coverage from Apple HQ), and it's time to see these AR/VR glasses the company has been working on for umpteen years.Shares of the tech giant are up almost 40% year to date, in part due to hype building for another new product category for Apple. And, Apple is generally viewed as a safe-haven play.But listen to the team at Morgan Stanley, and you get the sense these glasses have been the bigger tailwind for Apple's stock.""We estimate the AR/VR headset market can grow to $100 billion by 2030, and expand 5x by 2037, to over $500 billion,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring said in a research note ahead of the event.I am not sold on Apple's AR/VR glasses given the expected super high price point. And, I know I am not the only one who's skeptical about Apple having amazing success with a category that has always proven challenging. And how are they doing with that HomePod?Could we see a post-WWDC summer swoon in Apple's stock as glasses hype fades and recession talk resurfaces?Don't rule it out.5. The FedThe Fed could singlehandedly cut summer vacations short if it raises interest rates at its June 14 meeting. Why? The market has bet on the Fed pausing on rate hikes at the meeting, with maybe one more hike for the cycle coming at the July 26 gathering.Hopes for a Fed pause have fed (no pun intended) the markets' naturally bullish inclination — the Nasdaq Composite is up more than 25% on the year. The FANG+ Index is up about 65%.If the Fed doesn't deliver a pause, it may be a Summer Reset for markets.And that is one trend you won't want to be watching from a no-cell-service zone like the beach.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

The dividend yield will be 2.2% based on this payment which is still above the industry average. Check out our latest analysis for Flowserve Flowserve's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageIf the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much. Prior to this announcement, Flowserve's earnings easily covered the dividend, but free cash flows were negative. In general, we consider cash flow to be more important than earnings, so we would be cautious about relying on the sustainability of this dividend.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 43.4% over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 33%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendFlowserve Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.48 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $0.80. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 5.2% a year over that time. Companies like this can be very valuable over the long term, if the decent rate of growth can be maintained.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. It's encouraging to see that Flowserve has been growing its earnings per share at 15% a year over the past five years. The company is paying out a lot of its cash as a dividend, but it looks okay based on the payout ratio.Our Thoughts On Flowserve's DividendIn summary, while it's good to see that the dividend hasn't been cut, we are a bit cautious about Flowserve's payments, as there could be some issues with sustaining them into the future. While Flowserve is earning enough to cover the payments, the cash flows are lacking. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income.Story continuesIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

He said there will always be jobs for humans, despite the growth of automation, although the jobs of ""100 years from now will look almost nothing like the jobs of today.""SAFETY CONCERNSThe rapid development and popularity of generative AI since Microsoft-backed OpenAI launched ChatGPT last year are spurring global lawmakers to formulate laws to address safety concerns linked to the technology.Story continues""I think it would be a mistake to go put heavy regulation on the field right now or to try to slow down the incredible innovation,"" Altman told an audience of some 1,200 people at Tel Aviv University, but said he would obey regulations unlike some social media companies.The European Union is striding ahead with its draft AI Act, which is expected to become law later this year, while the United States is leaning toward adapting existing laws for AI rather than creating whole new legislation.Britain also wants to avoid heavy-handed legislation that could stifle innovation.""Israel - like Britain, and to a great extent like Canada, too - is at the U.S. end of the spectrum,"" Ziv Katzir, director of national AI planning at the Israel Innovation Authority, told Reuters.""It has been working on this matter for the last 18 months or so, with a view to achieving the right balance between innovation and the preservation of human rights and civic safeguards.""Israel published a 115-page draft AI policy in October and is collating public feedback ahead of a final decision.Altman also said that the company plans to open source more models over time. ""But I don't think it's the right strategy to open source everything,"" he said.Altman spoke by phone with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who tweeted that the two discussed opportunities and challenges facing the world and the State of Israel in relation to AI as well as Israeli cooperation to develop the AI field.(Writing by Dan Williams; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise, Alex Richardson and Sharon Singleton)]"

For example, homebuyers want to buy a house at a cheap price, but they get suspicious if the price is too low. Investors feel the same way when it comes to buying stocks. That’s because if the price of a home or a stock is too low, it’s natural to wonder if something is horribly wrong with the asset. So, I wanted to point out some of the top risky bargain stocks you’d be better off avoiding.WBAWalgreens Boots Alliance$30.01MMM3M$96.94DISDisney$88.29Walgreens (WBA)little girl holding a stock chart with athumbs down. stocks to avoidSource: ShutterstockLast Nov., Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA) announced that it anticipated that it would fork out as much as $4.95 billion over 15 years to “settle all opioid claims against it by participating states, subdivisions and tribes.” However, based on subsequent, actual settlements made by the firm, I believe that figure will prove to be way too low.For example, on May 18, WBA disclosed that it had agreed to pay nearly $230 million to settle San Francisco’s claims related to the opioid crisis against it. By May, the company announced that it would pay Florida $683 million to settle that state’s claims against it for damages related to the epidemic. So it’s already agreed to pay out 18.5% of the $4.95 billion to just one state and one medium-sized city. Clearly WBA is going to have to hand over much more than $5 billion to settle the claims against it.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWalgreens has a very low forward price-earnings ratio of 6.6, but it’s definitely one of the risky bargain stocks to void at all costs.3M (MMM)a frustrated man with a white board behind him that features a black downward arrowSource: ShutterstockLike Walgreens, 3M (NYSE:MMM) has a litigation problem. In fact, the company is facing about 260,000 lawsuits alleging its earplugs failed to protect members of the U.S. military from hearing loss. While the lawsuits are currently in mediation, indicating that 3M may be able to resolve the lawsuits, there’s no guarantee that the mediation will result in a settlement.Story continuesIn addition, RBC Capital kept an “underperform” rating on the shares. Although 3M reported stronger-than-expected Q1 results, the bank wrote that the firm’s full-year guidance suggests that the company’s performance will remain unimpressive this year. In addition, RBC Capital expects the company to continue to be plagued by supply-chain issues and its customers’ high inventory levels.MMM has a very low trailing price-earnings ratio of just ten, but its’ definitely one of the most risky bargain stocks in the market.Disney (DIS)earningsSource: ShutterstockDisney’s (NYSE:DIS) revenue last year surged to $82.72 billion from $67.4 billion year over year. All after its theme parks reopened and consumers returned to movie theaters. However, its streaming channels lost about $4 billion last year. It also continued to be hurt by the cord-cutting phenomenon and poor movie-theater  attendance. As a result of these negative catalysts, its operating margin fell from its historical median of 25% to just 8.3%. Unfortunately, with theatre attendance still low, and cord-cutting likely to persist, Disney may continue to struggle.Investment firm Macquarie recently downgraded DIS to “neutral,” saying that the company’s outlook is “clouded with uncertainties.” The financial performance of the company’s conventional TV networks are likely to deteriorate going forward, while DIS may not meet its goal of generating a profit from its streaming businesses next year, warned the firm. DIS stock has a forward price-earnings ratio of 23. That’s a low valuation for a growth stock, and many still put  DIS stock in the latter category. But Disney is clearly a high-risk bargain stock.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Fundamentally, companies that enjoy a long track record of success (and facilitating passive income) stand a better chance of weathering the storm. In addition, those companies that reward their shareholders with regular income are more able to mitigate downside. After all, those payouts must come from somewhere. So, a business that’s able to provide passive income usually aligns with a relevant industry. Therefore, you usually don’t go wrong with the best long-term dividend stocks.To be sure, nothing in the market or life offers guarantees. However, if you’re worried about both current events and things that haven’t happened yet, these are the dividend stocks for generational wealth that should serve your family (and your descendants) well.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsArcher Daniels Midland (ADM)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comA multinational food processing and commodities trading firm, Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) almost provides a no-brainer for top dividend stocks for future generations. Basically, the company guarantees itself permanent relevance because of its core business. I’ve said this before but no matter how advanced we become as a society, we humans will require basic goods. Obviously, food’s one of them.Specifically for best long-term dividend stocks, I like ADM even better. According to Dividend.com, Archer Daniels carries a forward yield of 2.47%. Although it’s not the most generous source of passive income, it does beat the consumer staple sector’s average yield of 1.89%. Also, its payout ratio sits at just under 27%, which translates to strong confidence in yield sustainability.Another factor that will likely prevent management from messing with the passive income is its 51 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. You don’t want to be the executive that lost Archer Daniels its status as a dividend king. Thus, it’s an easy choice for dividend stocks for generational wealth.Story continuesColgate-Palmolive (CL)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large text.Source: iQoncept/shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Midtown Manhattan, Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) is one of the world’s top consumer product companies. Fundamentally, Colgate offers a similar magnitude of relevance to Archer Daniels. No matter what happens in the future, we’ll need to take care of our teeth. Given the company’s importance to everyday basic care, CL is another no-brainer for top dividend stocks for future generations.To be sure, Colgate itself symbolizes a boring company in a boring industry. However, that’s part of CL’s charm, especially under present circumstances. Right now, the company carries a forward yield of 2.52%, again above the average yield of the consumer staples sector. Colgate’s payout ratio is significant higher than ADM’s at just under 56%. Nevertheless, that’s a reasonable ratio all things considered. Just as well, CL features 61 years of consecutive dividend increases. Again, you don’t want to be the person responsible for removal of dividend king status. Thus, it’s a dependable idea for dividend-paying stocks for family legacy.Sempra (SRE)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockOn a financial and political level, many investors might argue that utility giant Sempra (NYSE:SRE) does not belong on this list of top dividend stocks for future generations. First, Sempra doesn’t enjoy brilliant “paper” stats. For example, its Altman Z-Score – which is a predictor of bankruptcy – sits at 1.07, representing a distressed enterprise. On the political side, many folks have decided to leave California, of which Sempra dominates the southern region. Therefore, consistently unfavorable migration trends, SRE doesn’t seem a wise investment for best long-term dividend stocks.However, utility firms generally don’t have sterling financials. Instead, they command natural monopolies. As for the politics, listen – California being a coastal state to the critical Pacific ocean, it will always be relevant. Always, always, always – take it to the bank if you want. Finally, Sempra carries a forward yield of 3.31%. While it’s a bit lower than the utility sector’s average yield of 3.75%, its payout ratio is reasonable at 49.73%. As well, it enjoys 19 years of consecutive dividend increases.Microsoft (MSFT)Source: ShutterstockTo be fair, most investors probably don’t pick up shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to make it rich. Rather, the technology stalwart provides a reliable canvas for capital gains and a modest amount of passive income. However, as an idea for top dividend stocks for future generations, MSFT holds its own. It’s not sexy but I’m almost certain it will be around for the next 100 years.Fundamentally, Microsoft Windows continues to hold a dominant position regarding desktop operating system market share. To be fair, this metric slipped sharply since the end of last year but it remains impressive at 62.65%. Also, Microsoft has its hands in myriad other platforms and innovations so it’s not going anywhere.In terms of passive income, MSFT might seem like a joke based on its forward yield of 0.82%. However, the company also enjoys 20 years of consecutive dividend increases. As well, its payout ratio sits at 24.68%, offering maximum confidence regarding yield sustainability. Plus, Microsoft continues to be a growth machine. Per Gurufocus, its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 17.4%, above 71.21% of the competition.IBM (IBM)sheet of paper marked ""dividends"" with a $20 bill on top of it to represent dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockOne of the biggest names in the tech ecosystem, IBM (NYSE:IBM) also features a rich history, founded in 1911. For full disclosure, IBM ranks among the more volatile entities in recent sessions. Since the beginning of this year, shares of “Big Blue” fell nearly 9%. In the trailing year, they’re down more than 7%. Still, IBM may qualify as one of the top dividend stocks for future generations.For quite some time, IBM fell under pressure because of its exposure to legacy business units that progressively became less relevant. However, in recent years, its evolving management team aggressively pushed into pertinent arenas, such as hybrid cloud. Also, it’s a powerhouse in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Over the next decades, IBM should really be a dominant player.While you’re waiting for this narrative to pan out, IBM also ranks as one of the high-yield stocks for grandchildren. Sure, there are companies that offer higher rates of passive income but IBM’s forward yield of 5.15% is contextually reliable. Business-wise, it continues to expand into relevant sectors. Also, it features 30 years of consecutive payout increases, making it one of the popular dividend aristocrats.Iron Mountain (IRM)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockAn enterprise information management service, Iron Mountain (NYSE:IRM) focuses on multiple critical needs. These include records management, information destruction and data backup and recovery services. According to its public profile, as of 2020, over 94% of Fortune 1000 companies used Iron Mountain’s services to store and manage their information in some capacity.Moving forward, I see IRM’s relevance only rising, making it one of the top dividend stocks for future generations. Sure, the company’s digital protection services will undoubtedly thrive as more of our data hits the cloud. However, the biggest companies and the most critical organizations will hit up Iron Mountain for physical document and equipment storage.Basically, stuff happens. Plus, the smartest hacker in the world wouldn’t be able to crack paper documents. Almost as a bonus, IRM also ranks among the high-yield stocks for grandchildren. Currently, Iron Mountain carries a forward yield of 4.62%. However, sustainability might be an issue because of its sky-high payout ratio. Still, the long-term relevancy is a strong selling point.Chevron (CVX)dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockOn surface level, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) might seem the most controversial name on this list of dividend stocks for generational wealth. After all, go-green advocates have repeatedly stated that electric vehicles are the future. And they very well might be but probably for rich people. You have to at least consider the possibility that hydrocarbons may be around for a very long time.First, you must consider the science. Like it or not, hydrocarbons command high energy density. In fairness, scientists continue to conduct intense research and development to improve the energy density of EV batteries, among other key attributes. However, such tech costs plenty of money – money that regular folks even at scale might not be able to afford.In addition, as relatively new tech, EVs will likely foster social inequities. Basically, the rich will be able to afford fast-charging EVs that deliver 600 miles of total range while everyone else may be left with electric clunkers. For this and many other reasons, Chevron should still be relevant a century from now. Plus, its 3.92% forward yield makes it one of the best long-term dividend stocks.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

If you want to see the top 5 Canadian national parks, check out 5 Best National Parks in Canada.Parks remain a preferred outdoor setting for recreational activities and relaxation, for kids and adults alike. Canada has a total of 37 national parks and 10 national park reserves that cover approximately 336,343 square kilometers of land and represent 31 of Canada's 39 terrestrial natural regions. These protected areas are situated across all provinces and territories and feature diverse landscapes, including mountains, plains, boreal forests, tundra, lakes, glaciers, and more. Parks Canada is responsible for preserving these natural wonders and managing them in a way that allows visitors to appreciate and enjoy them without causing harm to their ecological integrity. As part of the National Parks System Plan, the government is striving to create a system that includes every distinct natural region in Canada.According to statistics, 2020 saw a decline of 28% in park goers as compared to 2019, with the number of visitors amounting to 11.8 million. Similarly, historic sites had only 5.3 million visitors in 2020, down by 39% when compared to the previous year. This situation was not only observed in Canada but the United States as well, where the national parks had 237 million visitors, down by 28% as compared to 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic hit all industries and sectors, including tourism at national parks. Since the governments imposed a lockdown and strict travel restrictions, national parks in Canada received almost no international visitors. However, outdoor spaces were open to the public for meditation, relaxation, exercise, and recreational activities during the lockdowns.Bilingual surveys were conducted by Park People in June 2020 to gain insights into the experiences of Canadians and municipalities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Park People conducted a public survey which gathered responses from over 1600 Canadian city residents regarding the impact of COVID-19 on their use and perceptions of parks. The survey results revealed that around 70% of Canadians reported a heightened appreciation for parks and green spaces during the pandemic. Additionally, 82% of Canadians agreed that parks have become more crucial for their mental well-being during COVID-19. The study also found that parks have had a significant impact on Canadians' social well-being, especially for those living alone. While 38% of those living with others believed that parks have become more important to their sense of social connection, the number rose to 47% for individuals living alone. These findings indicate that parks play a crucial role in promoting social connectedness and mental well-being among Canadians during the pandemic.Story continuesDuring the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, these parks were devastated financially due to comparatively lower visitors and declining international tourism, and many others sectors experienced a financial downfall right alongside them. For example, tourists opted for accommodations via Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), flights through airlines like Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV), and tourism companies such as Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE), all of whom suffered equally due to restrictions on international travel and tourism.However, according to the Fall Tourism Outlook released by Destination Canada in November 2022, Canada's tourism industry is on a path to recovery despite ongoing challenges. The lifting of COVID-19 restrictions and a resilient travel demand have contributed to a strengthening recovery trajectory. The outlook predicts that leisure travel will recover to pre-pandemic levels by 2024, which is one year earlier than the previous projection of spring 2022, and is considered an impressive achievement. The recovery of the domestic tourism market is leading the sector's resurgence, and strong spending is expected to facilitate a swift return to 2019 levels. The spending in the domestic travel market is predicted to reach 92% of 2019 levels by the end of 2022 and completely recover in 2023. The US market, which is Canada's biggest opportunity, is expected to see a boost in 2023, with spending reaching 91% of 2019 levels, following the lifting of border restrictions and a strong US dollar. The spending by US travellers in Canada is projected to reach 112% of 2019 levels in 2024. The increased tourist footfall in the country bodes well for national parks and historic sites in Canada as well.15 Best National Parks in CanadaMaksiMages/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyAdmittedly, Canada has an abundance of beautiful and statuesque national parks, each featuring unique natural elements that make it special.

The potential for dramatic economic disruption remains high despite a new federal debt ceiling agreement. There are no cuts to government spending — the rate of increase is only slowing. The debt ceiling, on the other hand, was raised by trillions of dollars for the next two years. Finding reliable stocks for a buy-and-hold strategy has never been more important.Investors should look for for safe stocks with consistent returns. Companies that have been through market downturns and recessions and emerged stable and sturdy on the other side are excellent candidates. The following three stocks have proven track records and handsomely rewarded investors for almost a century or more.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAmerican States Water (AWR)the interior of a water utility processing plantSource: ShutterstockPrimarily charged with providing clean water and electricity to Southern California, American States Water (NYSE:AWR) is a utility that has the longest record of raising its dividend of any other stock on the market. There’s a reason utilities were considered “widow-and-orphan stocks” as they were deemed stable investments that provided reliable revenue streams through all types of markets.Founded a month after the stock market crash of 1929, the water utility has paid a dividend for 86 consecutive years. It has also increased the payout for 68 straight years. That makes it a Dividend King, or a stock that has raised its dividend for 50 years or more. Moreover, its total return more than quadrupled in value over the past decade, or twice that of the S&amp;P 500. Today American States Water serves over 1 million customers across nine states and serves 11 military bases under 50-year contracts with the U.S. government. Its long-term recurring revenue stream makes this utility a top defensive stock for investors in times of economic turmoil.Story continuesPPG Industries (PPG)PPG Paints retail location. PPG stockSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comPaint and coatings specialist PPG Industries (NYSE:PPG) is another safe stock with consistent returns that has been rewarding investors for over 100 years. Founded in 1883, PPG began paying a dividend to shareholders 16 years later and never stopped. Just last month it made its 499th consecutive dividend payment. PPG has also reliably raised its payout for 51 consecutive years, making it a Dividend King as well. Having been around for 140 years, PPG has been through every business cycle imaginable. Beyond depressions and recessions, it has seen two world wars, terrorist attacks and several global pandemics — yet still marches on. Housing booms such as the one we most recently experienced do tend to boost PPG’s bottom line. Yet busts like we may soon experience also provide opportunity. If people feel they can’t afford to move, they often choose to renovate and remodel their homes instead. Few things are as cheap as a coat of new paint to revive stale décor. The coatings leader is second only to Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW) in terms of revenue. It owns such brands as Dulux, Glidden and Pittsburgh Paints, as well as Liquid Nails, Flood and Sico. It also owns Mexico’s largest paint supplier, Comex. PPG Industries is one of the safest stocks for portfolio stability amidst a worsening economy.Exxon Mobil (XOM)Exxon Retail Gas LocationSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comWe don’t hear much about “peak oil” anymore because advances in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing allowed the industry to become awash in supply. It is why the U.S. is the world’s largest producer of oil, bigger than even Saudi Arabia or Russia. It’s also why energy stocks are among the safest stocks for portfolio stability.Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) is the world’s biggest, non-government-owned energy company. It is able to trace its roots back to 1870 and John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Company. Although oil companies have not always been the best investments, due to boom-and-bust investment cycles, today’s oil stocks — particularly Exxon Mobil — are not the same as they were even a decade ago.Over the past 10 years Exxon’s total return has doubled that of the broad market index. By narrowing its focus to financing only its most profitable projects in the most profitable regions, Exxon posted its best year for profits in its 135-year history, with earnings of $55.7 billion last year.Although the U.S. is home to the largest percentage of Exxon’s assets, the oil and gas giant derives the vast majority of its profits from its international portfolio by a better than two-to-one margin. It trades at just 7 times trailing earnings, 11 times estimated profits and less than 10 times the free cash flow it produces.Exxon pays a quarterly dividend of $0.91 per share. It has raised the payout for 40 consecutive years, making it a Dividend Aristocrat. Possessing some of the top assets and operations in the industry, Exxon remains one of the most reliable stocks for a buy-and-hold strategy.On the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in AWR, PPG and XOM stock.

(NYSE:GS) is heavily dominated by institutional owners",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/77-ownership-shares-goldman-sachs-140030942.html,1685887230,STORY,"['GS', 'GSBD']","[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Goldman Sachs Group's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions50% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Insiders have been selling lately A look at the shareholders of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) can tell us which group is most powerful. With 77% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Goldman Sachs Group. View our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Goldman Sachs Group?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Goldman Sachs Group. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Goldman Sachs Group's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Goldman Sachs Group is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.5%. With 7.6% and 6.4% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Goldman Sachs GroupThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$544m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 22% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted   2 warning signs for Goldman Sachs Group  you should be aware of.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

IQDF seeks to match the performance of the Northern Trust International Quality Dividend Index before fees and expenses.The Northern Trust International Quality Dividend Index is designed to provide exposure to a high-quality income-oriented portfolio of long-only international securities issued by non-U.S.-based companies, with an emphasis on long-term capital growth and a targeted overall beta that is similar to that of the Northern Trust International Large Cap Index.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesInvestors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.Story continuesOperating expenses on an annual basis are 0.47% for IQDF, making it on par with most peer products in the space.It's 12-month trailing dividend yield comes in at 4.67%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.When you look at individual holdings, Royal Bank Of Canada Common Stock Cad 0 (RY) accounts for about 2.74% of the fund's total assets, followed by Novo Nordisk A/s Common Stock Dkk 0.2 (NOVOb.CO) and Bhp Group Ltd (BHP).IQDF's top 10 holdings account for about 19.62% of its total assets under management.Performance and RiskThe ETF return is roughly 8.02% and was up about 0.43% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 06/05/2023), respectively. IQDF has traded between $17.72 and $23.05 during this last 52-week period.IQDF has a beta of 0.86 and standard deviation of 16.31% for the trailing three-year period, which makes the fund a medium risk choice in the space. With about 280 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesFlexShares International Quality Dividend ETF is not a suitable option for investors seeking to outperform the World ETFs segment of the market. Instead, there are other ETFs in the space which investors should consider.FlexShares International Quality Dividend Defensive ETF (IQDE) tracks Northern Trust International Quality Dividend Defensive Index and the FlexShares International Quality Dividend Dynamic ETF (IQDY) tracks Northern Trust International Quality Dividend Dynamic Index. FlexShares International Quality Dividend Defensive ETF has $30.29 million in assets, FlexShares International Quality Dividend Dynamic ETF has $108.83 million. IQDE has an expense ratio of 0.47% and IQDY charges 0.47%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the World ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

45,da0beef4-7b15-3648-a33f-5569430d8669,AIG,2023-06-05,American International Group's (NYSE:AIG) Dividend Will Be Increased To $0.36,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-international-groups-nyse-aig-101452157.html,1685960092,STORY,['AIG'],"[American International Group, Inc.'s (NYSE:AIG) dividend will be increasing from last year's payment of the same period to $0.36 on 30th of June. The payment will take the dividend yield to 2.6%, which is in line with the average for the industry. See our latest analysis for American International Group American International Group's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsUnless the payments are sustainable, the dividend yield doesn't mean too much. However, American International Group's earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.EPS is set to fall by 1.6% over the next 12 months. If the dividend continues along the path it has been on recently, we estimate the payout ratio could be 17%, which is comfortable for the company to continue in the future.historic-dividendAmerican International Group Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $0.40, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $1.44. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 14% a year over that time. Rapidly growing dividends for a long time is a very valuable feature for an income stock.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. American International Group has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 58% per annum. Earnings per share is growing at a solid clip, and the payout ratio is low which we think is an ideal combination in a dividend stock as the company can quite easily raise the dividend in the future.We Really Like American International Group's DividendOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. The distributions are easily covered by earnings, and there is plenty of cash being generated as well. We should point out that the earnings are expected to fall over the next 12 months, which won't be a problem if this doesn't become a trend, but could cause some turbulence in the next year. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Story continuesIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. To that end, American International Group has 2 warning signs (and 1 which can't be ignored) we think you should know about.

Talks between the actors union and major studios are scheduled to start on Wednesday.Over the weekend, the studios likely averted another work stoppage by reaching a tentative deal with the Directors Guild of America (DGA). That pact will take effect if DGA members vote to ratify it.Actors, in their negotiations, will seek higher pay and safeguards against unauthorized use of their images through artificial intelligence. Their current deal expires June 30.In a letter to members urging them to vote in favor of a strike authorization, SAG-AFTRA leaders said the industry had changed dramatically with the rise of streaming television and the emergence of new technology such as generative AI.""We have fully entered a digital and streaming entertainment industry, and that demands a contract that is relevant to the new business model,"" the letter said.A spokesperson for the Alliance of Film and Television Producers (AMPTP), which represents Walt Disney Co, Netflix Inc and other major studios, had no comment.The month-long strike by more than 11,500 members of the Writers Guild of America (WGA) has disrupted production of late-night shows and shut down high-profile projects including a new season of Netflix's ""Stranger Things"" and a ""Game of Thrones"" spinoff for Warner Bros Discovery's HBO.An actors' strike would lead to a broader shutdown and increase pressure on studios that need programming to feed their streaming services and the fall TV broadcast schedule.During the last WGA strike in 2007 and 2008, a studio deal with the DGA prompted writers to head back to the bargaining table.On Friday, WGA negotiator Chris Keyser argued that would not be the case this time.""Any deal that puts this town back to work runs straight through the WGA, and there is no way around that,"" Keyser said in a video posted on YouTube.

The Directors Guild represents more than 19,000 directors and members of the directorial team. The guild and the AMPTP began contract negotiations on May 10.The tentative deal marks a relatively quick resolution of contract negotiations in Hollywood this year, where the film and television writers have been on strike since May 2 after failing to reach an agreement with studios on better pay and work security.The month-long work stoppage by members of the Writers Guild of America has disrupted production of late-night shows and shut down high-profile productions such as Netflix's ""Stranger Things.""A vote to ratify the tentative agreement is scheduled for Tuesday, the DGA said. If approved, the deal could offer a blueprint for negotiations with the striking writers and for the upcoming talks between studios and SAG-AFTRA, the union representing Hollywood actors.Striking film and television writers have received support from labor unions representing workers in the tourism and hospitality industries, teachers, logistics workers and public employees, setting the stage for what one union leader called a ""hot labor summer.""(Reporting by Maria Caspani; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)]"

Its patents begin to expire this year, opening the door to a cheaper biosimilar entering the market, and raising expectations that the company would need to lower the $13,000 per month price of Stelara.Availability of biosimilars should trigger a reduction in the price of older biotech medicines, if not by as much as generics do for traditional pills. But legal agreements under which rival drugmakers delay market entry to escape lengthy patent litigation have held back their launches, keeping prices high.Analysts currently expect J&amp;J to bring in $54.5 billion in 2025 pharmaceutical sales on average, and for Stelara sales to fall from $9.9 billion this year to $7.5 billion in 2024 after a key U.S. patent expires in September, according to Refinitiv data. Two analysts have estimated $5.4 billion for Stelara in 2025.J&amp;J is forecasting $57 billion in pharmaceutical sales by 2025 after reducing its previous view of $60 billion in April, citing currency dynamics that hurt its pharmaceutical business in 2022.Analysts told Reuters the Stelara deal with Amgen might put the New Brunswick, New Jersey-based company on track to achieve that amended sales projection, despite early skepticism.“I don’t think that (deal) is going to get them all the way to $57 billion, but now there’s potentially a path for them to get to that number, whereas before there didn’t seem to be one because they were several billion dollars away,” said Guggenheim analyst Vamil Divan.He said the drug, which also treats Crohn's disease and other autoimmune conditions, could generate sales closer to $10 billion in 2024, dropping to $7.5 billion to $8.5 billion the following year. That would add around $4.6 billion to average estimates for pharmaceutical sales, as long as no biosimilars enter the market before 2025.Story continuesAmgen said last month the confidential settlement it signed with J&amp;J will allow it to sell its Stelara biosimilar no later than Jan. 1, 2025.The company’s use of the phrase ""no later than"" has cast some doubt on Stelara’s prolonged exclusivity. There is also the potential for other drugmakers to launch their own biosimilars before Amgen, although J&amp;J could sue to stop that happening, according to Credit Suisse analyst Trung Huynh.“If no Stelara biosimilars enter in 2024, I think growth should continue at around 4% in 2023 and 2024,” Huynh said.Alvotech and Teva Pharmaceutical’s AVT04 could be the next Stelara biosimilar to get U.S. approval in the second half of 2023, Divan said in an analyst note, so long as they address manufacturing issues raised by the Food and Drug Administration over Alvotech’s Reykjavik manufacturing plant.Neither Teva nor Alvotech responded to requests for comment.A J&amp;J spokesperson said the company would continue to defend its intellectual property after its Stelara settlement and that the agreement won’t affect its 2023 financial outlook.J&amp;J is “making good progress” toward its 2025 guidance, the spokesperson said, building on recent comments at an investor conference that it had increasing confidence it could hit its target.(Reporting by Patrick Wingrove; editing by Caroline Humer and Bill Berkrot)]"

52,3837d6fa-db1d-34a9-9fea-606a452ffa29,ZTS,2023-06-05,Zoetis' (NYSE:ZTS) five-year earnings growth trails the strong shareholder returns,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zoetis-nyse-zts-five-earnings-140043797.html,1685887243,STORY,['ZTS'],"[Stock pickers are generally looking for stocks that will outperform the broader market. And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. For example, the Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS) share price is up 98% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 46% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 2.6% , including dividends .After a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals. See our latest analysis for Zoetis There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, Zoetis managed to grow its earnings per share at 17% a year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 15% per year. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. Indeed, it would appear the share price is reacting to the EPS.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Zoetis' key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Zoetis's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Zoetis, it has a TSR of 105% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveZoetis shareholders gained a total return of 2.6% during the year. But that was short of the market average. It's probably a good sign that the company has an even better long term track record, having provided shareholders with an annual TSR of 15% over five years. It may well be that this is a business worth popping on the watching, given the continuing positive reception, over time, from the market. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Case in point: We've spotted   1 warning sign for Zoetis  you should be aware of.But note: Zoetis may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with past earnings growth (and further growth forecast).Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on QUALCOMM's  ROE.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. Check out our latest analysis for QUALCOMM How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for QUALCOMM is:54% = US$11b ÷ US$20b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.54 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.A Side By Side comparison of QUALCOMM's Earnings Growth And 54% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that QUALCOMM has a significantly high ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 16% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. Under the circumstances, QUALCOMM's considerable five year net income growth of 49% was to be expected.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared QUALCOMM's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 32%.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is QCOM worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether QCOM is currently mispriced by the market.Is QUALCOMM Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?QUALCOMM's three-year median payout ratio is a pretty moderate 32%, meaning the company retains 68% of its income. By the looks of it, the dividend is well covered and QUALCOMM is reinvesting its profits efficiently as evidenced by its exceptional growth which we discussed above.Moreover, QUALCOMM is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 34%. However, QUALCOMM's future ROE is expected to decline to 35% despite there being not much change anticipated in the company's payout ratio.ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with QUALCOMM's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. With that said, on studying the latest analyst forecasts, we found that while the company has seen growth in its past earnings, analysts expect its future earnings to shrink.

63,6ff6c320-d68e-3d30-961c-c09cbec13adc,LMT,2023-06-05,Lockheed Martin's (NYSE:LMT) investors will be pleased with their decent 63% return over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lockheed-martins-nyse-lmt-investors-110026060.html,1685962826,STORY,['LMT'],"[When you buy and hold a stock for the long term, you definitely want it to provide a positive return. But more than that, you probably want to see it rise more than the market average. But Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 42% over five years, which is below the market return. However, if you include the dividends then the return is market beating. Zooming in, the stock is up just 2.5% in the last year.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. View our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, Lockheed Martin achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 23% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 7% over the same period. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Lockheed Martin the TSR over the last 5 years was 63%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Lockheed Martin shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 5.2% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. However, that falls short of the 10% TSR per annum it has made for shareholders, each year, over five years. The pessimistic view would be that be that the stock has its best days behind it, but on the other hand the price might simply be moderating while the business itself continues to execute. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Take risks, for example - Lockheed Martin has   2 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.Lockheed Martin is not the only stock that insiders are buying.

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study PulteGroup's  ROE in this article.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for PulteGroup How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for PulteGroup is:29% = US$2.7b ÷ US$9.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.29 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.PulteGroup's Earnings Growth And 29% ROEFirst thing first, we like that PulteGroup has an impressive ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 20% which is quite remarkable. Under the circumstances, PulteGroup's considerable five year net income growth of 27% was to be expected.Story continuesWe then performed a comparison between PulteGroup's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 31% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if PulteGroup is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is PulteGroup Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?PulteGroup's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 8.3%, which is quite low. This implies that the company is retaining 92% of its profits. So it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business and this reflects in its earnings growth number.Additionally, PulteGroup has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 7.7%. Regardless, PulteGroup's ROE is speculated to decline to 20% despite there being no anticipated change in its payout ratio.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that PulteGroup's performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. That being so, according to the latest industry analyst forecasts, the company's earnings are expected to shrink in the future. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

Its patents begin to expire this year, opening the door to a cheaper biosimilar entering the market, and raising expectations that the company would need to lower the $13,000 per month price of Stelara.Availability of biosimilars should trigger a reduction in the price of older biotech medicines, if not by as much as generics do for traditional pills. But legal agreements under which rival drugmakers delay market entry to escape lengthy patent litigation have held back their launches, keeping prices high.Analysts currently expect J&amp;J to bring in $54.5 billion in 2025 pharmaceutical sales on average, and for Stelara sales to fall from $9.9 billion this year to $7.5 billion in 2024 after a key U.S. patent expires in September, according to Refinitiv data. Two analysts have estimated $5.4 billion for Stelara in 2025.J&amp;J is forecasting $57 billion in pharmaceutical sales by 2025 after reducing its previous view of $60 billion in April, citing currency dynamics that hurt its pharmaceutical business in 2022.Analysts told Reuters the Stelara deal with Amgen might put the New Brunswick, New Jersey-based company on track to achieve that amended sales projection, despite early skepticism.“I don’t think that (deal) is going to get them all the way to $57 billion, but now there’s potentially a path for them to get to that number, whereas before there didn’t seem to be one because they were several billion dollars away,” said Guggenheim analyst Vamil Divan.He said the drug, which also treats Crohn's disease and other autoimmune conditions, could generate sales closer to $10 billion in 2024, dropping to $7.5 billion to $8.5 billion the following year. That would add around $4.6 billion to average estimates for pharmaceutical sales, as long as no biosimilars enter the market before 2025.Story continuesAmgen said last month the confidential settlement it signed with J&amp;J will allow it to sell its Stelara biosimilar no later than Jan. 1, 2025.The company’s use of the phrase ""no later than"" has cast some doubt on Stelara’s prolonged exclusivity. There is also the potential for other drugmakers to launch their own biosimilars before Amgen, although J&amp;J could sue to stop that happening, according to Credit Suisse analyst Trung Huynh.“If no Stelara biosimilars enter in 2024, I think growth should continue at around 4% in 2023 and 2024,” Huynh said.Alvotech and Teva Pharmaceutical’s AVT04 could be the next Stelara biosimilar to get U.S. approval in the second half of 2023, Divan said in an analyst note, so long as they address manufacturing issues raised by the Food and Drug Administration over Alvotech’s Reykjavik manufacturing plant.Neither Teva nor Alvotech responded to requests for comment.A J&amp;J spokesperson said the company would continue to defend its intellectual property after its Stelara settlement and that the agreement won’t affect its 2023 financial outlook.J&amp;J is “making good progress” toward its 2025 guidance, the spokesperson said, building on recent comments at an investor conference that it had increasing confidence it could hit its target.(Reporting by Patrick Wingrove; editing by Caroline Humer and Bill Berkrot)]"

(NASDAQ:MRNA), a biotechnology company pioneering messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics and vaccines, and Merck (NYSE:MRK), known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, today announced distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) results from the Phase 2b randomized KEYNOTE-942/mRNA-4157-P201 study, a clinical trial evaluating mRNA-4157 (V940), an investigational individualized neoantigen therapy (INT), in combination with KEYTRUDA, Merck's anti-PD-1 therapy, in patients with resected high-risk melanoma (stage III/IV). In the overall intention-to-treat (ITT) population, adjuvant treatment with mRNA-4157 (V940) in combination with KEYTRUDA demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in DMFS, a key secondary endpoint of the study, compared with KEYTRUDA alone and reduced the risk of developing distant metastasis or death by 65% (HR=0.347 [95% CI, 0.145-0.828]); one-sided p value=0.0063). The secondary endpoint of DMFS, defined as the time from the first dose of KEYTRUDA until the date of first distant recurrence or death from any cause, was pre-specified for statistical testing following the positive primary endpoint of recurrence-free survival (RFS). These late-breaking data are being presented for the first time today at 5:00 p.m. ET during an oral abstract session at the 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting (abstract #LBA9503).Story continues""We are excited to be sharing these results with the oncology community and thrilled to see such an exceptional result in distant melanoma recurrence or death. Patients who experience metastases at distant sites typically have worse survival outcomes and a poor prognosis, thus these results showing a reduction in the risk of distant recurrence underscore the potential of neoantigen therapy,"" said Kyle Holen, M.D. Moderna's Senior Vice President and Head of Development, Therapeutics and Oncology. ""These results add to the emerging picture of how individualized neoantigen therapy may transform melanoma treatment and the promise it may hold for other types of cancer. Together with Merck, we are rapidly advancing our efforts to move this forward for patients.""""Patients with stage III and IV melanoma can be at high risk of having their cancer recur or metastasize to other sites,"" said Dr. Eric H. Rubin, senior vice president, global clinical development, Merck Research Laboratories. ""These new DMFS results build upon the positive recurrence-free survival data previously observed from this Phase 2b study, and we look forward to working with Moderna to initiate a Phase 3 study in melanoma later this year.""Based on data from KEYNOTE-942/mRNA-4157-P201, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation and the Priority Medicines (PRIME) scheme, respectively, for mRNA-4157 (V940) in combination with KEYTRUDA for the adjuvant treatment of patients with high-risk melanoma following complete resection. The companies recently announced the first presentation of the study's primary endpoint, RFS, from the Phase 2 KEYNOTE-942/mRNA-4157-P201 trial in April 2023 at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting.Adverse events reported with mRNA-4157 (V940) in KEYNOTE-942 were consistent with those previously observed in a Phase 1 clinical trial. The safety profile of KEYTRUDA was consistent with findings from previous studies. The number of patients reporting treatment related Grade ≥ 3 adverse events were similar between the arms (25% vs 18%, respectively). The most common adverse events of any grade attributed to either mRNA-4157 (V940) or the combination of mRNA-4157 (V940) and KEYTRUDA were fatigue (60.6%), injection site pain (55.8%) and chills (50.0%).Exploratory Subgroup Analysis Evaluating Minimal Residual Disease by ctDNAData from an exploratory subgroup analysis of KEYNOTE-942/mRNA-4157-P201 (Abstract #LBA9515) evaluating minimal residual disease (MRD) by circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) as a biomarker of RFS in resected high-risk melanoma patients treated with mRNA-4157 (V940) in combination with KEYTRUDA were also presented. For ctDNA assessments, tumor core biopsies and matched whole-blood samples were subjected to whole-exome sequencing to identify patient-specific somatic variants. The personalized amplicon-based next-generation sequencing assay from NeoGenomics (RaDaR®) was used to select up to 48 variants most suitable for MRD detection and analysis of ctDNA in baseline plasma samples. The ctDNA-evaluable population (n=125) across both study arms was representative of the total ITT population (n=157). The majority of ctDNA-evaluable patients were ctDNA-negative at baseline (88.0%, n=110/125), compared to ctDNA-positive patients at baseline (12.0%, n=15/125). In ctDNA-negative patients at baseline, RFS was higher with mRNA-4157 (V940) in combination with KEYTRUDA (n=77) versus KEYTRUDA monotherapy (n=33), representing a 78% reduction in recurrence or death (HR=0.225 [95% CI 0.095-0.531]). A similar trend was observed for ctDNA-positive patients (n=13 for the combination arm; n=2 for KEYTRUDA only) at baseline. However, the small sample size of the ctDNA subgroups limits the interpretation of these results. The association between MRD patterns and mRNA-4157 (V940) treatment effect will be further explored in upcoming planned studies.About mRNA-4157 (V940)mRNA-4157 (V940) is a novel investigational messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)-based individualized neoantigen therapy1 consisting of a single synthetic mRNA coding for up to 34 neoantigens that is designed and produced based on the unique mutational signature of the DNA sequence of the patient's tumor. Upon administration into the body, the algorithmically derived and RNA-encoded neoantigen sequences are endogenously translated and undergo natural cellular antigen processing and presentation, a key step in adaptive immunity.Individualized neoantigen therapies are designed to prime the immune system so that a patient can generate an antitumor response specific to their tumor mutation signature. mRNA-4157 (V940) is designed to stimulate an immune response by generating specific T cell responses based on the unique mutational signature of a patient's tumor. KEYTRUDA is an immunotherapy that works by increasing the ability of the body's immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. Based on early clinical studies, combining mRNA-4157 (V940) with KEYTRUDA may potentially provide an additive benefit and enhance T cell-mediated destruction of tumor cells.About KEYNOTE-942/mRNA-4157-P201 (NCT03897881)KEYNOTE-942 is an ongoing randomized, open-label Phase 2b trial that enrolled 157 patients with high-risk stage III/IV melanoma. Following complete surgical resection, patients were randomized 2:1 (stratified by stage) to receive mRNA-4157 (V940) (1 mg every three weeks for nine doses) and KEYTRUDA (200 mg every three weeks up to 18 cycles [for approximately one year]) versus KEYTRUDA alone for approximately one year until disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint is RFS, defined as the time from first dose of KEYTRUDA until the date of first recurrence (local, regional, or distant metastasis), a new primary melanoma, or death from any cause in the intention-to-treat population. Secondary endpoints include DMFS and safety, and exploratory endpoints include distribution of TMB expression in baseline tumor samples across study arms and their association with the primary RFS endpoint.Key eligibility criteria for the trial included: patients with resectable cutaneous melanoma metastatic to a lymph node and at high risk of recurrence, patients with complete resection within 13 weeks prior to the first dose of KEYTRUDA, patients were disease free at study entry (after surgery) with no loco-regional relapse or distant metastasis and no clinical evidence of brain metastases, patients had a formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor sample available suitable for sequencing, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status 0 or 1 and patients with normal organ and marrow function reported at screening.About melanomaMelanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer, is characterized by the uncontrolled growth of pigment-producing cells. The rates of melanoma have been rising over the past few decades, with nearly 325,000 new cases diagnosed worldwide in 2020. In the U.S., skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer diagnosed, and melanoma accounts for a large majority of skin cancer deaths. It is estimated there will be nearly 100,000 new cases of melanoma diagnosed and almost 8,000 deaths resulting from the disease in the U.S. in 2023. The five-year survival rates are estimated to be approximately 60.3% for stage III and 16.2% for stage IV.About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mgKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body's immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.Merck has the industry's largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.Selected KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.MelanomaKEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.KEYTRUDA is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adult and pediatric (12 years and older) patients with stage IIB, IIC, or III melanoma following complete resection.See additional selected indications for KEYTRUDA in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety InformationSelected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDASevere and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.Immune-Mediated PneumonitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions.

70,2e512be7-486d-31ab-9827-70ffa3bf0aa0,MRK,2023-06-05,Cancer vaccines poised to unlock 'new treatment paradigm' with Merck/Moderna data,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cancer-vaccines-poised-unlock-treatment-120000880.html,1685966400,STORY,"['MRK', 'MRNA']","[By Julie SteenhuysenCHICAGO, June 5 (Reuters) - Adding an experimental mRNA-based vaccine from Moderna Inc and Merck &amp; Co reduced the risk that the most deadly skin cancer would spread by 65% over treatment with an immunotherapy alone in a midstage trial, the companies reported on Monday.The results, presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in Chicago, follow earlier promising data from the trial showing the customized mRNA vaccine given in combination with Merck's Keytruda cut the risk of death or recurrence of melanoma by 44% compared with Keytruda alone.The findings add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that mRNA technology, which rose to prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic, can be used to assemble personalized vaccines that train the immune system to attack the specific type of cancer cells in a patient's tumors.Scientists have been chasing the dream of vaccines to treat cancer for decades with few successes. Experts say mRNA vaccines, which can be produced in as little as eight weeks, paired with drugs that rev up the immune system may lead to a new generation of cancer therapies.The hope is for ""a completely new treatment paradigm in cancer that will be better tolerated and unique to individual patients' tumors,"" said Dr. Jane Healy, an executive overseeing in early cancer treatment development at Merck.The Merck/Moderna collaboration is one of several combining powerful drugs that unleash the immune system to target cancers with mRNA vaccine technology. Pfizer's COVID vaccine partner BioNTech SE and Gritstone Bio Inc are taking similar approaches using mRNA technology.The vaccines all target neoantigens, new mutations that are only present on tumors. Aiming at these unique proteins allows the immune system to kill cancer cells while leaving healthy tissue unscathed.The trick is determining which of many mutations is driving the cancer.To accomplish this, tumors are removed and their genetic makeup is mapped using next-generation DNA sequencing. Companies use artificial intelligence to predict which mutations will be the most effective targets. These are used to build an individualized vaccine targeting only mutations in the patient's tumor.Story continuesDuring this process, patients typically receive an immunotherapy such as Keytruda or Roche's Tecentriq, which block a mechanism cancer uses to hide from the immune system.'A STARTING POINT'Long before COVID, companies had been eyeing messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which carries instructions for cells to make specific proteins, as a vehicle for delivering a cancer vaccine.Merck and Moderna have been collaborating since 2016. Researchers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) in New York began working with Germany's BioNTech in 2017.At that time, there was already proof that immunotherapy could work in so-called ""hot"" tumors, or highly mutated cancers, such as melanoma. There was little hope it would work in ""cold"" cancers with few mutations, such as pancreatic cancer, said MSK's Dr. Vinod Balachandran.With standard treatment, 90% of pancreatic cancer patients die within five years of diagnosis.Balachandran's team studied the rare long-term survivors and found an immune system component called T cells in these individuals were able to recognize mutations derived from the cancer, raising the possibility of a targeted vaccine.In a small ongoing trial testing a made-to-order BioNTech vaccine plus Roche's Tecentriq, half of the 16 pancreatic cancer patients mounted an immune response, and none showed signs of relapse after 18 months, according to data published last month in Nature.Gritstone Bio is taking a different tack, combining two types of customized vaccines in hopes of treating patients with metastatic colon cancer, another cancer that has been largely unresponsive to immunotherapy.The approach first primes the immune system with an older technology called a chimpanzee adenovirus vaccine that targets patients' tumors. That is followed by a personalized self-amplifying mRNA vaccine, which includes an enzyme that makes extra copies of the antigens, reducing the required dose.Gritstone is expecting data from a later-stage trial testing its dual vaccine therapy in the first quarter of 2024.""Based on everything we've shown and we've published, we're really excited,"" said Gritstone CEO Andrew Allen.Merck and Moderna are planning a larger Phase 3 trial in melanoma and are also testing its combination in lung cancer.""We see this as a starting point,"" Healy said.

71,de6e2dd5-b278-3a01-b7c1-0a260e3a5ebb,ROK,2023-06-05,Investors in Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) have seen decent returns of 81% over the past five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-rockwell-automation-nyse-rok-142319755.html,1685888599,STORY,['ROK'],"[Generally speaking the aim of active stock picking is to find companies that provide returns that are superior to the market average. And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. For example, the Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK) share price is up 65% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 46% (ignoring dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 37% in the last year , including dividends .So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. See our latest analysis for Rockwell Automation To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, Rockwell Automation achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 29% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 10% over the same period. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Rockwell Automation has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Rockwell Automation, it has a TSR of 81% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Rockwell Automation has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 37% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 13%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

So it's definitely got to hold back capacity growth,"" he said.""It's frustrating because airlines can see strong demand, but they're not able to match supply with demand in many markets.

But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. For example, the TE Connectivity Ltd. (NYSE:TEL) share price is up 39% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 29% (not including dividends).Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. View our latest analysis for TE Connectivity To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.TE Connectivity was able to grow its EPS at 47% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. This EPS growth is higher than the 12% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has moderated its expectations for growth, somewhat.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that TE Connectivity has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? Take a more thorough look at TE Connectivity's financial health with this free report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, TE Connectivity's TSR for the last 3 years was 46%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 4.2% in the last year, TE Connectivity shareholders lost 1.2% (even including dividends). Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 7% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand TE Connectivity better, we need to consider many other factors.

For more IoT stocks, head on over to 5 Internet of Things (IoT) Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On. As a technology, the consumer use of the Internet is entering its fourth decade. And over the past forty odd years, it has evolved quite a bit. If you're old enough, you'd remember that connecting to the Internet in the 1990s and the early 2000s required using a dialup modem with its familiar tune of signals being sent to a network to establish a connection.The era of broadband, which came roughly around the same time as the smartphone, and the growth in WiFi devices marked the first major shift in internet use. Consumers were no longer limited either to their desks or to slow speeds to access the web, and as a result, the kinds of applications and data that could be used grew exponentially. This growth came a little while before 3G internet smartphones provided high speed internet right into a consumer's hands, and the subsequent proliferation of dongles enabled anyone with a laptop to access the Internet as long as there was a supportive telecommunications tower in sight.Settling into the 2020s, it's all about two main technologies in the Internet scene. These are fifth generation (5G) telecommunications networks and low Earth orbit (LEO) internet satellites. With the latter, you can access the net anywhere on the planet as long as there are satellites orbiting and you have the right equipment such as a dish. With the former, the opportunity for a multi billion dollar industry is at the doorstep of countless firms.This industry is the Internet of Things (IoT) industry. Starting off with the basics, the global IoT industry was worth $399 billion in 2022 and will grow to be worth $486 billion in 2023. From then until 2027, the sector is expected to grow at a whopping compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21.4% to be worth an estimated $1 trillion by the end of the forecast period according to research from The Business Research Company. The research firm adds that Asia Pacific was the largest segment of the IoT market - unsurprising as we'll find out later when we delve deeper into its myriad of use cases. The Business Research Company adds that automotive use is a major industry to utilize IoT gadgets, and collectively the gadgets will provide companies with vast amounts of data to sift through to generate analytical insights.Story continuesOne key sector that is vastly expected to benefit from IoT devices is the industrial segment. This area involves using machines to manufacture products on a large scale, and the use of IoT gadgets enables manufacturing managers to catch errors, consolidate and gather new data, and ensure real time monitoring of the factory line. Therefore, it's unsurprising that the industrial Internet of Things industry is quite lucrative.  A research report from Grand View Research shows that this area was worth $321 billion in 2022 and will grow at a CAGR of 23.2% from this year until the end of the decade to be worth $1.6 trillion. Within industrial IoT use, the manufacturing segment commanded an 18% market share in 2022 and will continue to be the largest portion moving forward. In terms of growth rate, the logistics segment is anticipated to outpace the broader market and exhibit a CAGR of 24%.Yet, these estimates are only representative of what money the IoT companies will make. But what about the value they will generate? On this front, McKinsey has some rather stunning estimates. It believes that by 2030, IoT could enable users to deliver an absolute eye popping $12.6 trillion in value - nearly ten times the revenue that IoT companies will generate according to some estimates. The factory segment will account for 26% of this value generation, and healthcare use is expected to come in second place at a best case 14% share. Additionally, and as is the case with most high technology industries (another example being biotechnology), the developed world is estimated to hold the lion's share (55%) of this value.Rounding off our analysis by taking a look at the situation on the ground, management of smart lighting and other equipment maker Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE:AYI) shared during its second quarter of 2023 earnings conference:With our product vitality and service efforts, we make products that deserve to be chosen and our independent sales agents ensure that they are chosen. Product vitality is driving success across our portfolio and during NEXT 23, we introduced several new products. I want to highlight a couple here. The first was the new nLight AIR System Input Device. This is an indoor controller that can be used in multiple spaces, including office, commercial and retail. The device converts analog outputs to wireless broadcast to control intelligent luminaires. This reduces the need for complex wiring solutions during installation and reduces the associated cost for the customer. The second was the nLight AIR rPOD Micro. This is a battery-powered wall switch that can be used as a traditional wall switch or as a remote, providing control from anywhere within a build space.This is a really exciting extension of the technology and an elegant response to our customers’ need for flexibility. These and other products continue to gain market attention. This quarter, several of our architectural lighting brands, A-Light, Eureka and Luminis, won a total of eight Good Design Awards from the Chicago Athenaeum which recognizes products and industry leaders in design and manufacturing that have chartered new directions for innovation. Now moving to our Intelligent Spaces Group. The spaces team continued to perform well, delivering another quarter of solid sales and operating profit growth, driven by the continued success of Distech. Distech is winning because we have the best digital control solutions in the market. It’s technology is open protocol which means you can connect our controller to most new or existing systems in a build space, giving our customers significant flexibility.With these details in mind, let's take a look at hot IoT stocks finding favor from billionaires, out of which the top ones are DexCom, Inc.

85,e1a3d70b-ddd9-331d-a0c7-5a6cabfc26d2,MPC,2023-06-05,INSIGHT-Energy sector's COVID recovery turns into massive CEO payday,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insight-energy-sectors-covid-recovery-100000953.html,1685959200,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'XOM', 'OXY', 'EQT', 'MPC']","[By Tim McLaughlinJune 5 (Reuters) - The CEOs of America’s biggest oil companies were paid a lot more in the first year of the COVID crisis than initially estimated, thanks to stock-heavy compensation packages that have since soared in value, according to an examination of pay disclosures over three years.The pandemic, with lockdowns the norm, resulted in a steep decline in oil and gas consumption and the loss of one in six jobs in the industry. Even so, a Reuters analysis of stock-based pay granted to CEOs at 20 U.S. oil and gas companies in 2020 more than doubled by 2023 when shares vested. That steep increase highlights a system that can richly reward executives amid mass layoffs, refinery closures and slashed capital spending.The analysis of filings by companies in the S&amp;P 500 Energy Sector Index shows stock-based CEO pay is now worth nearly $500 million, up sharply from initial estimates of $187 million.Investors, shareholder advocates and professors who study CEO pay say the eye-popping returns on COVID-era compensation reflect the problems of stock-heavy pay for energy CEOs, chiefly that it often links pay too closely to external factors including oil and gas price swings instead of to long-term financial performance.“Compensation committees need to do a better job of rewarding executives for true out-performance and not just necessarily where the commodity price is,” Aeisha Mastagni, a portfolio manager at the $307 billion California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS), said in response to the Reuters analysis.Public pensions and popular index mutual funds have endured lagging performance in the U.S. energy sector for a decade. The S&amp;P 500 Energy Sector Index’s total return has been 38% since May 2013, far behind the broader S&amp;P 500’s total return of 206%.The pay jump also comes after COVID-era damage across the oil industry, which saw huge spending cuts and widespread job losses. Several hundred employees at a Marathon Petroleum refinery in California, for example, were forced to find new jobs for much less pay, said Virginia Parks, a University of California Irvine professor who studied the plight of the laid off workers.Story continuesMarathon declined to comment about the job cuts.Meanwhile, the executives' compensation surge distorts the CEO pay ratios that companies are required to disclose to investors to demonstrate executive pay is reasonable compared to other employees. One example: Occidental Petroleum Corp said in 2020 that CEO compensation was 104 times higher than median employee pay, but Reuters reporting shows it was in fact 230 times higher after stock gains over the past three years.Occidental said its CEO pay ratio follows the rules laid out by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Christina Noel, a spokesperson for the American Petroleum Institute, noted the energy industry’s CEO pay ratio is the second lowest among 11 industry sectors featuring S&amp;P 500 companies.IT'S RELATIVE WHEN IT COMES TO RETURNSTo be sure, the value of stock-based pay shrinks when markets sour. But most energy CEOs also have a measure of built-in protection from steep declines. CEOs can receive 100% or more of the payout on stock grants tied to total shareholder return even if investors lose money.That’s because about 90% of energy companies measure stock performance against others in the same industry who tend to suffer at similar times. They use a metric called relative total shareholder return (TSR) and benchmark it against a pre-determined group of peer companies - making it possible for executives to get big payouts even if their companies’ stocks lose value.Some CEOs are also paid dividends on unvested restricted stock they technically don't own yet. At ExxonMobil, CEO Darren Woods receives several million dollars a year in cash dividends on unvested restricted stock, according to the oil giant’s pay disclosures.And since becoming CEO in 2017, the number of shares underlying Woods' annual restricted stock grant has grown 70% to 225,000, bolstering his dividend payout, company filings show.Paying dividends on unvested stock grants is opposed by top proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services. Many large companies, including Coca-Cola and Microsoft, have disavowed the practice.Exxon declined to comment on why it pays dividends on unvested stock, but it takes 10 years for each annual grant of restricted stock at Exxon to fully vest.“We believe this unique, long-term approach aligns our executives’ decisions and interests with those of our long-term shareholders,” Exxon said in an email.The $242 billion New York State Common Retirement Fund, which owned several billion dollars worth of oil and gas stocks at the end of March, agreed the 3-year vesting period that’s common in the energy sector is too short.PAY METRICS 'TOO EASY?'Some CEOs profited when the timing of their stock grants coincided with sharp declines in their companies’ share price, giving them more room to benefit from a rebound.Marathon Petroleum’s Michael Hennigan received $9.6 million in stock-based pay, most of it granted on March 17, 2020, the day he became CEO. The grant coincided with one of the lowest closing stock prices in the company’s history as a publicly traded company, according to Refinitiv data.Hennigan’s 2020 stock-based pay fully vested this March with a value of about $45 million, or nearly 5 times the company’s initial estimate. Marathon Petroleum’s total return has been a sector leader, rising nearly 500% under Hennigan.“If a CEO’s stock-based pay more than doubles from the initial estimate, it is excessive,” said Rosanna Landis Weaver, director of wage justice and executive pay at As You Sow, a shareholder advocacy group that reviewed the Reuters reporting. “It tells me that the metrics they are using to base the awards of stock on are too easy.”Some energy CEOs, also benefited from a good performance compared to peers that boosted the overall volume of restricted shares granted, according to proxy statements filed with the SEC.EQT Corp CEO Toby Rice, for example, ultimately received nearly 1.1 million performance shares as part of his 2020 grant, 32% more than the target amount estimated by the company because EQT’s stock outperformed peers and the company’s cash flow satisfied vesting conditions, EQT said in its latest proxy statement. That lifted his overall stock-based pay to about $65 million.The company did not return messages seeking comment.Many energy companies are under pressure from investors to reform CEO pay, according to disclosures in their annual proxy statements. Phillips 66, for example, like many of its peers, now details their compensation discussions with investors to show they’re responsive to their concerns and making changes.The company also capped stock awards linked to total shareholder return if investors lose money after investors complained.“...Recent changes to executive compensation reflect investor feedback,” Phillips 66 told Reuters in an email.Mastagni at CalSTRS, however, said reforms on payouts linked to negative shareholder returns still do not go far enough.“Why should we be paying anything out of shareholder coffers if you lost us money?” Mastagni asked.

In fact, there are two key reasons for this. One, these types of stocks typically pay out regular dividends. Many of them offer above-average yields and/or have a long track record of dividend growth. Returns from dividends may at first glance appear modest (low-to-mid single-digits), but these can really add up, and add tremendously to long-term total returns.Two, thanks to the more inflation and recession-resistant nature of high-quality consumer stocks, equities in this category typically experience consistent earnings growth over time. In turn, this translates into consistent price appreciation, as they rise in value in line with increasing earnings. So, what are some of the best long-term consumer stocks to buy today? Consider these seven. All of them are attractively-priced.BTIBritish American Tobacco$32.60COKECoca-Cola Consolidated$673.04DGDollar General$205.10KRKroger$47.31KVUEKenvue$26.30PMPhilip Morris$90.84TAPMolson Coors$60.64InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBritish American Tobacco (BTI)man's hand holding wads of cash. stocks to buy. Stocks With 1000% UpsideSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comAs its name suggests, British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI) is a tobacco company operating in both the U.K. and the U.S. Despite this global diversification, BTI’s high exposure to the declining U.S. cigarette market (where it sells brands like Camel and Newport) has led the market to price BTI stock at a heavily-discounted 9 times earnings. Still, it’s possible this investor pessimism has gone too far.Like one of its main peers (which I will discuss further below), the company has made a big move into non-cigarette tobacco and nicotine products. With this, BTI may be able to stay consistently profitable, and more importantly, to sustain its high dividend (forward yield of 8.23%). Maintaining this high yield will make it one of the best buy and hold consumer stocks.Story continuesCoca-Cola Consolidated (COKE)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comCoca-Cola Consolidated (NASDAQ:COKE) is America’s largest independent bottler of Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) products. COKE lacks the blue-chip cache (not to mention the Warren Buffett seal of approval) that KO stock enjoys.However, long-term COKEstock investors have had the benefit of owning one of the best long-term consumer stocks in terms of performance. While KO stock is up just 50.7% since May 2013, COKE has increased in value by 1,032.4% during this time frame. Admittedly, it may prove difficult for this stock to make a similar move higher between now and 2033.Still, trading for only 13.9 times earnings, shares remain more reasonably-priced than KO, which trades for 26.4 times earnings. Earnings growth and further multiple expansion could pave the way for continued appreciation. In addition, the stock pays out a modest dividend (0.3%) that could provide an additional slight boost to total returns.Dollar General (DG)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7When inflation began to spike in 2021, many investors looked to Dollar General (NYSE:DG) as one way to play the trend. This provided shares, already up thanks to the unexpected tailwinds for the retail industry due to the Covid-19 lockdowns in 2020, an additional lift through 2022.But so far in 2023, market enthusiasm for DG stock has dipped. Why? Even as high inflation resulted in higher sales for Dollar General and its peers, this has been outweighed by the impact of this same trend on profit margins.That said, the current sentiment for DG today may work to your advantage, as it trades for only 18.2 times forward earnings. As inflation eases, Dollar General’s earnings are expected to bounce back starting this fiscal year. The discount retailer is also investing heavily to gain market share. All of this could result in continued growth for this consumer stock.Kroger (KR)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comThere’s been a major uncertainty hanging over shares in grocery store operator Kroger (NYSE:KR). That would be the company’s planned merger with peer Albertson’s (NYSE:ACI).Investors and commentators believe that this merger would be beneficial to future returns for KR stock. Yet given the backlash regarding the deal from consumer groups and politicians, admittedly it is unclear whether this transaction will get the regulatory go-ahead. Despite the controversy, though, as analysts at Bernstein recently argued, this transaction is still likely to close.This deal could lead to strong returns ahead for KR shares. This merger is expected to be accretive to earnings within the first year, with further earnings boosts expected from planned cost savings. Add to this catalyst KR’s low valuation (10.5 times forward earnings) and respective dividend yield (2.2%), and it’s clear why it’s one of the best long-term consumer stocks.Kenvue (KVUE)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen.

Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comKenvue (NYSE:KVUE) isn’t a household name, but its current parent company, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), certainly is, as are the company’s portfolio of consumer health brands, which include Tylenol, Listerine, and many others.KVUE stock just recently became publicly-traded, with JNJ’s sale of a 10% stake in the company via an IPO. JNJ plans to eventually distribute its 90% stake to investors, through a tax-free spinoff. If volatility ahead of the spinoff pushes Kenvue down to its IPO price ($22 per share), you may want to buy it.While not yet paying out a dividend, as analysts at Morningstar have pointed out, the company plans to initiate a dividend, which at the IPO price would give shares a 3.7% annualized yield. KVUE also trades at a discount to peers at this price level. All of this could in time make it one of the high-performing consumer stocks.Philip Morris (PM)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comIn past coverage of Philip Morris (NYSE:PM), I talked about this tobacco company’s appeal as a high-yield dividend play, but PM’s 5.6% forward dividend is only one aspect to its overall appeal.That is, PM stock is also poised to continue steadily increasing its earnings in the coming years. Yes, like I mentioned above, peers with BTI are also moving into higher-growth areas of the tobacco industry (namely, non-cigarette tobacco and nicotine products). However, Philip Morris International has arguably made the greatest progress in this area.Largely, due to its successful launch of the IQOS heated tobacco product. PM’s purchase of established smokeless tobacco/nicotine products maker Swedish Match also helps to make it a stronger growth contender than other names in the space. While pricier than BTI, the growth aspect to the PM “story” makes it also one of the best long-term consumer stocks.Molson Coors (TAP)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comMolson Coors (NYSE:TAP) has been making headlines recently, due to the controversy surrounding a highly-publicized marketing decision by rival Anheuser-Busch Inbev (NYSE:BUD). This controversy has resulted in increased sales for this brewer’s light beer products such as Miller Lite and Coors Light.Investors initially bid up TAP stock due to this news, but shares have since pulled back, as the market no longer expects this tailwind to last. However, others beg to differ. Last week, analysts at Hedgeye argued that Molson Coors could hold onto these recent long-term market share gains.This could lead to greater-than-expected earnings. In turn, this of course points to further gains ahead for TAP shares. This unexpected catalyst, plus a low valuation (14 times forward earnings) and a moderate dividend yield (2.56%), make TAP a strong contender to be one of the great buy and hold consumer stocks going forward.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayWall Street Titan: Here’s My #1 Stock for 2023It doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

Software and hardware integrations between the Waters™ PATROL™ UltraPerformance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC™) ProcessWaters Corporation (PRNewsfoto/Waters Corporation)Analysis System and the Sartorius™ Resolute® BioSMB™ multi-column chromatography platform will give bioprocess engineers access to more comprehensive analytical data for downstream batch and continuous manufacturing, improving yields while reducing waste and driving down biomanufacturing costs.""From the beginning of our collaboration with Sartorius, we've strived to give bioprocess engineers faster and more direct access to critical quality attribute information about their drug products in the name of improving production yields and getting drugs to patients faster,"" said Jon Pratt, Senior Vice President, Waters Division. ""Based on the positive response of customers to our collaborative efforts with upstream bioprocessing analytics, we see tremendous benefit to combining the PATROL Process Analysis System and the Sartorius BioSMB to bring timely point-of-decision analytics to downstream biomanufacturing for monoclonal antibodies, recombinant proteins, vaccines and AAV gene therapies.""Story continues""Now that intensified, continuous manufacturing of biologics is becoming a reality, there is a greater need for real-time analytical measurement,"" said René Fáber, Head of Bioprocess Solutions Division, Sartorius. ""The value of combining technologies from Sartorius and Waters lies in bringing fundamentally important analytics to the point where it is needed and giving bioprocess engineers a more complete understanding of their downstream manufacturing processing and its effects on drug product quality. We believe this can have significant impacts on drug production costs by helping to increase yields and reduce waste.""In-process sampling and the analysis of biological drugs sent to a central laboratory can take weeks before the results of necessary quality checks are in. Waters and Sartorius have shown how bioprocess scientists can streamline these analytics, so that product quality tests for protein A, aggregation and charge variants occur closer to the process, potentially saving weeks of production time. This has a positive impact on total process yield and product quality because the individual downstream unit operation can be further optimized much more easily, and corrective actions can be taken much faster.Additional ResourcesLearn more about the Sartorius Resolute BioSMB system.Learn more about the Waters PATROL UPLC Process Analysis System.Follow and connect with Waters via LinkedIn, Twitter, and FacebookAbout Sartorius (www.Sartorius.com)The Sartorius Group is a leading international partner of life sciences research and the biopharmaceutical industry.

And for most market goers, that means watching the action on the Yahoo Finance app (which I strongly encourage you to download) from a beach, a park, or a pool.While the natural inclination is to ""sell in May and go away,"" I humbly say: please don't do that. Not just because we have bills to pay here, but because there is a litany of interesting stories to track in the markets. I would argue there are many more compelling stories for investors compared to Summer 2022.Here is a tiny sampling of things I am watching during a summer that probably won't involve me going to a beach, pool, or house party because well — investing ""stuff"" is all I got going for me. The order is totally random and not in order of importance.1. Target's stockShares have been hammered by close to 14% in the past two weeks since the company removed LGBTQ+ merchandise from its stores. The fear is consumer backlash means weakening sales and a missed second quarter. The company also caught a JP Morgan downgrade on concerns the restart of student loan payments in Sept. 1 will hurt sales.Unclear if there is a near-term catalyst to jumpstart Target's stock considering all of this, which comes after another tough quarter of sales.2. The economic impact of student loan repaymentsThe downgrade to Target's stock could be a canary-in-the-coal-mine indicator of what analysts and market strategists do this summer before the repayments begin. Are more retailer ratings cut? Do strategists trim their S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates and year-end price targets? How will markets react? The market reaction to the Target downgrade was modest, but can it continue?Story continuesMake no mistake, the payment restart will be a headwind for an economy that doesn't need one.Goldman Sachs estimates student loan repayments will subtract 0.2 percentage points from personal consumption expenditures growth this year if the loan forgiveness plan is struck down, or 0.1 percentage point if the plan stands.Jefferies economist Thomas Simons thinks at least $400 a month in spending capacity will be removed from the pockets of those with student loans.""So as we're now adding this back in to balance sheets that are already pretty strained by two years of very high inflation that's run significantly higher than wage growth, the capacity to absorb this in a lot of budgets I think is much worse now,"" Simons said on Yahoo Finance Live.3. AI StocksIt's time for investors to draw a differentiation in AI stocks. Not doing so could prove very painful to one's portfolio.On the one hand, you have credible companies infusing generative AI into their businesses to unlock efficiencies and win new business. I was very impressed by what HP CEO Enrique Lores told me about how AI will transform the personal computer starting in 2024. With that, the company and rival Dell could be winners of a PC refresh cycle in 2024.I was also surprised to learn from Hewlett Packard Enterprise CFO Tarek Robbiati that the company has secured $800 million in new AI-related business.I fancy we may hear something positive very soon from AMD on the generative AI front. Maybe not as Earth-shattering as Nvidia, but strong enough to excite investors.Salesforce has an AI investor day slated a week from today. And Cisco Live is underway in Las Vegas — AI discussions will probably be front and center here.Again, these are credible companies working on cool AI stuff for the benefit of investors.On the other end of the spectrum, you have companies such as c3.AI.The money-losing company is being attacked by short sellers —such as the super-thorough Ben Axler at Spruce Point— for suspect accounting standards. I think many on the Street are beginning to drill down into the fundamentals of these more fringe AI plays to avoid getting burned —much like when the SPAC bubble burst.I expect a summer of AI scrutiny, leading to a possible rotation into more credible AI stocks.4. Apple's stockApple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) kicks off today (our tech editor Dan Howley will have full live coverage from Apple HQ), and it's time to see these AR/VR glasses the company has been working on for umpteen years.Shares of the tech giant are up almost 40% year to date, in part due to hype building for another new product category for Apple. And, Apple is generally viewed as a safe-haven play.But listen to the team at Morgan Stanley, and you get the sense these glasses have been the bigger tailwind for Apple's stock.""We estimate the AR/VR headset market can grow to $100 billion by 2030, and expand 5x by 2037, to over $500 billion,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring said in a research note ahead of the event.I am not sold on Apple's AR/VR glasses given the expected super high price point. And, I know I am not the only one who's skeptical about Apple having amazing success with a category that has always proven challenging. And how are they doing with that HomePod?Could we see a post-WWDC summer swoon in Apple's stock as glasses hype fades and recession talk resurfaces?Don't rule it out.5. The FedThe Fed could singlehandedly cut summer vacations short if it raises interest rates at its June 14 meeting. Why? The market has bet on the Fed pausing on rate hikes at the meeting, with maybe one more hike for the cycle coming at the July 26 gathering.Hopes for a Fed pause have fed (no pun intended) the markets' naturally bullish inclination — the Nasdaq Composite is up more than 25% on the year. The FANG+ Index is up about 65%.If the Fed doesn't deliver a pause, it may be a Summer Reset for markets.And that is one trend you won't want to be watching from a no-cell-service zone like the beach.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

That pressure poses the risk of leading to a collapse. Even absent a collapse, a substantial decline in price is highly likely. Interest rates remain high and the Fed has signaled that it may again raise rates further. Work-from-home trends continue to be an issue. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWorkers are dug in and ready to fight against a return to office. That affects these commercial real estate stocks to sell in a tangible way, as much of their business relies on office buildings and physically present workers. Renewed rounds of tech layoffs hasten the stresses on commercial real estate. So, investors should steer clear as the bottom could fall out any day leading to rapid and substantial losses. Here are 7 commercial real estate stocks to sell before they get much worse.VNOVordano Realty Trust $13.33BXPBoston Properties $47.74HIWHighwoods Properties $20.41KRCKilroy Realty’s$26.91SLGSL Green Realty$21.99HPPHudson Pacific Properties $4.50CUZCousins Properties $19.85Vordano Realty Trust (VNO)a large house has a For Sale sign out frontSource: ShutterstockVordano Realty Trust (NYSE:VNO) stock is an excellent example of how hard-hit commercial REITs have been in 2023. The company operates a portfolio of office and retail space primarily in New York City, with other holdings in San Francisco and Chicago.Currently, several signs suggest that Vordano Realty Trust is already on a rapid downward trajectory. In the first three months of 2023, shareholder net income dropped to $5.168 million. A year earlier that figure stood at $26.478 million. That is a signal shareholders should think twice about holding on to VNO shares.  Further, Vordano Realty Trust announced it is postponing dividends on its shares until the end of 2023. The dividend was yielding over 11% and remained one of the prime enticements for potential investors.Story continues Generally speaking, REIT dividends are high because of the risk inherent in the business model. Once suspended, one of the major benefits of investing is gone. Boston Properties (BXP)Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of boston properties, stock market chart background. BXP stock.Source: Ralf Liebhold / ShutterstockBack in 2021, Boston Properties (NYSE:BXP) was featured in a Barron’s article about return-to-office stocks. Vaccinations and cherry-picked stories praising in-office work strengthened the narrative for BXP. A year-and-a-half later, the pendulum has swung back in the other direction and office space operators are facing significant risks.Boston Properties is the largest publicly traded U.S. firm in premier office spaces. It operates spaces in Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. It’s fair to assume that east and west-coast workers are more difficult to force back into office than some of their sun belt counterparts. That’s an important factor in states where workers’ rights are stronger. And it’s a detriment to Boston Properties in this case. Net income fell from $143 million to $77.9 million during the first quarter. The company is leaning heavily into the biotech/life sciences sector by signing leases with companies in that industry. But there is little reason to believe that can make up for the losses overall. Highwoods Properties (HIW)A photo of a person in a neon green vest holding blueprints and standing behind a white table covered with supplies like pencils, a computer, a ruler and two wooden house shapes.Source: ARMMY PICCA/ShutterStock.comHighwoods Properties (NYSE:HIW) rents exclusively within the sun belt. In sun belt states a top-down approach is more common: If employers favor RTO, then it’s much easier to implement. At first blush, that looks to be one factor resulting in stronger operations at Highwoods Properties The numbers substantiate the idea that HIW is a better firm than the two firms immediately above. Revenues increased modestly from $206.4 million to $212.75 million in the first quarter. Net income and income available to stockholders increased as well. But the company terminated more than twice as many leases a year ago during the same quarter. It also raised rents by 15.9% while increasing its footprint by roughly 35%. That larger footprint costs more now as interest rates are higher. Highwood Properties is pushing higher rents onto firms that will struggle in a recession. They may not pay at all, so those higher rents now might look good, but may be a false flag. Kilroy Realty (KRC)A shot of a single family home with a green lawn and trees in the background.Source: ShutterstockThe vast majority of Kilroy Realty’s (NYSE:KRC) portfolio is concentrated in California, with a few of properties in Seattle and Texas. remaining properties, 7 are in Seattle and 2 in Texas. The same argument applies here for KRC stock: Workers in west coast states have a lot more leverage for working from home.Shareholders continue to be skeptical about Kilroy Realty. The company’s fundamentals aren’t getting worse, though. Revenues increased by 10.3% in the first quarter and net income was up 6.7%. Yet share prices continue to slide and have lost more than 30% year-to-date.My guess is that tech fears have something to do with investor reticence around KRC. The company signed a 20,000 sq ft lease at  Indeed Tower during the quarter. Another round of tech layoffs is underway. That will affect Indeed as the labor market continues to soften for white-collar workers.SL Green Realty (SLG)Source: ShutterstockSL Green Realty (NYSE:SLG) stock represents Manhattan’s largest office landlord. The financial center of the U.S. is ground zero for the RTO vs. remote work argument. In late 2022, media reports of workers trickling back to NYC offices abounded. By early 2023 though, New York City Mayor Eric Adams was trying to force major Wall Street firms to mandate office returns. That’s a clear negative sign for SL Green Realty given its position as the largest office landlord. The firm’s revenues increased in the first quarter, up approximately 20%. Yet expenses increased a much faster 50% during the same period and SL Green Realty went from net gains to net losses.

Hudson Pacific Properties (HPP)Flat cut-out image of house jammed into the crack of dry desert, symbolizing housing crisisSource: shutterstock.com/Roman BodnarchukHudson Pacific Properties (NYSE:HPP) is another of the highly concentrated commercial real estate stocks to sell. The company leases spaces to tech companies and media companies. That leaves it highly concentrated in San Francisco and Los Angeles, the respective epicenters of those sectors. Its fundamentals are flat over the first quarter. The company made about $250 million in sales and lost $20 million. That’s pretty much in line with where it was a year ago. What’s interesting about the company is how heavily it is betting on a resurgent tech sector. Over 80% of new leasing activity during the quarter occurred in San Francisco. The potential problem there is that most of the resurgence in tech in 2023 was in major tech names and AI narratives. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has held up its end of the bargain with a very strong quarter. But will that success trickle down throughout silicon valley and boost the leasees at Hudson Pacific Properties? If it doesn’t then HPP stock could be in for a real shock as those small firms ability to pay rent decreases. Cousins Properties (CUZ)A photo of a man in a mask and neon green vest in front of a home that's under construction.Source: Tong_stocker/ShutterStock.comCousins Properties (NYSE:CUZ) stock provides the antithesis to the notion that Sun Belt REITs are doing better overall.  Net income available to stockholders decreased from $28 million to $22.2 million during the first quarter. Cousins Properties leased property to Silicon Valley Bank in Phoenix. Although the company continues to receive payment on the property, the fact that it is prominently mentioned in the earnings report suggests the risk of default is high. Cousins Properties is in a position in which revenue growth of 8.5% is slower than expenses growth, at 13.1%. That is likely to result when losses continue to grow. The company also has a $62 million loan maturing June 1 for which it took out another loan to pay. In short, Cousins Properties looks to be taking out higher-interest debt to pay lower-interest debt which is a recipe for trouble in the long run. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Billionaires Are Crazy About These 5 Stocks. Investors seem to have ignored all the panic around debt ceiling and are instead salivating over the possibility that the Federal Reserve might stop increasing interest rates. If the US government successfully raises the debt ceiling and avoids default, the stock market could continue its positive trajectory for a while longer. On May 3, the Federal Reserve increased interest rates for the 10th consecutive time. However, the Fed indicated that these hikes may have reached their conclusion, partly due to concerns within the banking system. According to Jerome Powell, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, a reduction in bank lending would impede an economy that the central bank was already trying to regulate as part of a larger effort to control and alleviate high inflation.Despite lingering worries about a potential recession in the later part of 2023, which have persisted for around 10 to 11 months, there is currently a sense of investor optimism. This is driven by satisfactory earnings in the first quarter and the possibility of the Federal Reserve temporarily halting interest rate hikes, which sets the stage for a strong market in June. The U.S. economy is also showcasing remarkable strength, as indicated by key factors like GDP and employment. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, there was a rise of 339,000 in total nonfarm payroll employment in May. However, the unemployment rate also increased by 0.3 percentage points to reach 3.7%. The sectors that experienced job gains included professional and business services, government, health care, construction, transportation and warehousing, and social assistance. Furthermore, the recent solid performance of financial, industrial, and material sectors disproves the notion of an impending economic slowdown, as these cyclical stocks normally drop in value before an economic downturn.Story continuesDon't Miss: 10 Chinese Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up OnMorningstar's valuations suggest that investors can benefit from a portfolio that combines both value and growth investments, while reducing exposure to core investments. Both the value and growth categories are considered undervalued, although the growth category has become relatively less undervalued compared to the start of the year due to its strong performance so far. On the other hand, the core category is less appealing in comparison to the overall market average as it is closer to fair value. In terms of market capitalization, the valuations of large-cap stocks have slightly surpassed the market average due to their strong performance in the first quarter. On the other hand, mid-cap stocks are slightly below the overall market average in terms of valuations. However, small-cap stocks are notably undervalued, as they are currently trading at a significant 33% discount, as per Morningstar’s report. Amid the stock market swings, billionaire investors exhibit a strong affinity towards lucrative investment opportunities in the realm of high-quality stocks. As per Insider Monkey’s data, some of the top stocks favored by billionaires during Q1 2023 included Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Our Methodology Insider Monkey tracks billionaire-owned stocks and in this article, we selected the top 10 stocks that attracted the highest number of billionaire investors during the first quarter of 2023. We have also mentioned the overall hedge fund sentiment towards each stock as of Q1 2023. Billionaires Are Crazy About These 10 StocksImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayBillionaires Are Crazy About These Stocks10. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 144Number of Billionaire Investors: 21Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), an American company focused on mobility technology, is a highly sought-after stock among billionaires. In Q1 2023, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)’s revenue of $8.8 billion climbed 27.5% year-over-year, beating Wall Street estimates by $90 million. Year-over-year, gross bookings experienced a growth of 19%, and the Mobility and Delivery adjusted EBITDA margins achieved their highest quarterly levels to date. The number of monthly active platform consumers increased by 13%, reaching a total of 130 million. This growth was primarily fueled by an ongoing enhancement in consumer engagement with Uber’s Mobility services.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) was part of 144 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 135 funds in the prior quarter. Billionaire David Tepper's Appaloosa Management held a $190.2 million stake in Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) during Q1 2023. In addition to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), billionaires are loading up on Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) shares. RiverPark Large Growth Fund made the following comment about Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER): Uber was a top contributor in the quarter following better-than-expected 4Q results and 1Q guidance. Gross Bookings grew 19% year over year to $31 billion, driven by 31% Mobility Gross Bookings growth and 6% Delivery Growth Bookings growth. 4Q Adjusted EBITDA of $665 million, up $579 million year over year, significantly beating management’s $600-$630 million guidance. Management guided to continuing growth in 1Q for Gross Bookings (20%- 24% growth) and Adjusted EBITDA (of $660-$700 million).UBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with a greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates. Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now solidly profitable with the potential for substantial margin expansion and free cash flow generation to come. We view UBER as more than just ride sharing and food delivery, but also as a global mobility platform with the ability to sell to its 131 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as package and grocery delivery, travel, truck brokerage (the company had $1.5 billion in Freight revenue for 4Q22), and worker staffing for shift work. Given its $4 billion of unrestricted cash and $5 billion of investments, the company today has an enterprise value of $70 billion, indicating that UBER trades at 1.6x next year’s estimated revenue.”9. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 132Number of Billionaire Investors: 22NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a technology company specializing in graphics processing units, computing, semiconductors, and artificial intelligence. Riding the wave of investor enthusiasm around artificial intelligence, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues to experience a remarkable surge in its stock price, which could potentially push its valuation beyond $1 trillion if these gains persist.On May 24, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported a Q1 Non-GAAP EPS of $1.09 and a revenue of $7.19 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.17 and $670 million, respectively. In fiscal year 2024's first quarter, NVIDIA distributed $99 million to its shareholders in the form of cash dividends. The company has announced that its upcoming quarterly cash dividend of $0.04 per share will be paid on June 30, to all shareholders recorded on June 8.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 132 hedge funds were bullish on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), up from 106 funds in the prior quarter. Billionaire Rajiv Jain's GQG Partners is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with a position worth $2.3 billion. Additionally, Insider Monkey’s records suggest that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was part of 22 billionaire portfolios at the end of March 2023. Alger Spectra Fund made the following comment about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) for a variety of end markets, such as gaming, PCs, data centers, virtual reality and high-performance computing. The company is leading in most secular growth categories in computing, and especially artificial intelligence and super-computing parallel processing techniques for solving complex computational problems. Simply put. Nvidia’s computational power is a critical enabler of Al and therefore critical to Al adoption, in our view. As such, we believe Nvidia is a long-term high unit volume growth opportunity. During the period, NVIDIA reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that met expectations, as the company navigated. through an inventory correction associated with the broad macroeconomic slowdown. Moreover, management gave fiscal year earnings guidance that was better than analyst estimates. noting strong year-over-year growth in gaming and data centers. Management’s constructive assessment of 2023 prospects. coupled with the rapid rollout and adoption of generative Al offerings, led to positive share price performance.”8. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 173Number of Billionaire Investors: 24Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) was part of 24 billionaire portfolios at the end of Q1 2023. In the second fiscal quarter, the non-GAAP earnings per share of Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) reached $2.09, surpassing the average estimate of analysts at $1.99. Additionally, the net revenue for the quarter amounted to $7.99 billion, compared to the consensus estimate of $7.79 billion. The company's results for the fiscal Q2 exceeded expectations in terms of both revenue and earnings, exhibiting growth compared to the same period in the previous year. This positive outcome can be attributed to robust cross-border volume.On May 1, Barclays analyst Ramsey El-Assal raised the firm's price target on Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) to $272 from $270 and reiterated an Overweight rating on the shares.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 173 hedge funds were bullish on Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), compared to 177 funds in the earlier quarter. Billionaire Chris Hohn’s TCI Fund Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 19.3 million shares worth $4.3 billion. Polen Global Growth Strategy made the following comment about Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“We trimmed Mastercard and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) to equal weights of the Portfolio. Mastercard and Visa operate as a duopoly in a large and growing market. Over the last 50 years, global personal consumer expenditures (PCE) has grown 7-9% annualized. We expect 4-5% long-term PCE growth going forward. Additionally, the shift from cash to credit continues unabated, with a total credit penetration of only approximately 50% globally.3 This shift provides Visa and Mastercard with another ~4-6% of growth. When combined with PCE, this gives both companies high-single-digit to low-double[1]digit revenue growth opportunities. This growth estimate is before accounting for growth amplifiers like the acceleration of e[1]commerce, the shift from offline to online, and additional services. Both companies enjoy extremely strong network effects that provide strong competitive advantages.We have trimmed Visa and Mastercard because their combined weight grew to over 12% of the Global Growth Portfolio because of their recent performance and to fund our increase in Amazon’s position size. We added to both positions when their prices were depressed due to cross-border transactions deteriorating materially from the pandemic. Cross-border volumes came roaring back when travel corridors reopened, and although we are several quarters removed from the cross-border nadir, Visa still grew volumes &gt;30% in 1Q23. Total cross-border volumes are now 132% of 2019 levels. At 4.5% each, both companies remain high conviction positions for Global Growth.”7. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 128Number of Billionaire Investors: 25Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is a highly favored stock among billionaires, with 25 billionaires holding the company's stock in the first quarter of 2023. On May 18, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPADS of $1.56, beating market estimates by $0.21. The revenue of $30.32 billion topped Wall Street consensus by $410 million. After Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) reported its March quarter results and expressed positive expectations for user and order growth in the June quarter, BofA analyst Joyce Ju reaffirmed a Buy rating on the stock on May 19. However, the analyst lowered the firm's price target on the shares from $144 to $132. During the earnings call, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) also revealed plans for a full spinoff of its Cloud unit, IPOs of Cainiao and Freshippo, and external financing for international e-commerce within the next 6 to 18 months. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 128 hedge funds were long Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), compared to 113 funds in the prior quarter. Billionaire Lei Zhang's Hillhouse Capital Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 3.7 million shares worth $386.7 million. L1 Long Short Fund made the following comment about Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) (Long +16%) shares performed strongly based on favorable sentiment surrounding China’s re-opening and indications from Chinese authorities that the prolonged restructuring process of Alibaba/Ant Financial was finally drawing to a close. The company remains a high-quality business with leading positions in both eCommerce and Public Cloud. We exited our position in January at around US$116 per share with the shares having rallied more than 90% since their early November lows and our China re-opening catalyst having played out. We subsequently re-entered the position in March with the shares having pulled back and with the company announcing a new organizational and governance structure. Alibaba has announced plans to split into six major business groups – Cloud Intelligence, Taobao Tmall, Local Services, Global Digital, Cainiao Smart Logistics and Digital Media and Entertainment Group. Each of these groups will be managed independently (separate CEO and board) and have the flexibility to raise external capital and potentially pursue separate IPOs. We believe this announcement is a strong catalyst to unlock the inherent sum-of-the-parts valuation discount in the company.”6. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 116Number of Billionaire Investors: 25UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) operates as a diversified health care company in the United States. In the first quarter of 2023, 25 billionaires held stakes in UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH). On April 14, the company reported a Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $6.26 and a revenue of $91.9 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.18 and $2.12 billion, respectively. On May 25, Piper Sandler analyst Jessica Tassan initiated coverage of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) with an Overweight rating and a $580 price target. Piper Sandler believes that the Optum businesses within UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) will play a crucial role in delivering consistent and exceptional earnings per share growth over the next ten years. The firm asserted that Optum will be the driving force shaping UnitedHealth's trajectory in the coming decade, serving as an increasingly important entry point to the broader enterprise.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 116 hedge funds were bullish on UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), compared to 110 funds in the earlier quarter. Billionaire Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is the biggest stakeholder of the company. Like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is on the radar of billionaire investors. Alger Spectra Fund made the following comment about UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is an integrated healthcare benefits company uniquely positioned to address rising healthcare costs for its customers, due to its vertical integration, size, and scale. The Optum health benefits services unit, which accounts for approximately 45% of the company’s operating earnings, in our view, has the potential to grow even further as customers look for ways to manage rising healthcare costs. During the period, shares detracted from performance due to several factors: 1) many 2022 healthcare winners with shorter duration profiles and persistent earnings profiles, such as UnitedHealth Group. underperformed in the first quarter of 2023, 2) uncertainty surrounding Medicare Advantage reimbursement levels from the Federal government in 2023, which will be determined later in the year, and 3) increased regulatory scrutiny in the form of potential Medicare Advantage audits across the industry. While these concerns have impacted UnitedHealth in the near-term, we believe company fundamentals remain intact given its large scale business model, competitive advantages, and medium to long- term growth prospects.” Click to continue reading and see Billionaires Are Crazy About These 5 Stocks.  Suggested articles:15 Best Healthcare Stocks To Buy Now20 Poorest Countries in Europe16 Best Retirement Communities in Florida Near the Beach Disclosure: None.

The company has a dividend payout ratio of just above 40% and a dividend that has more than doubled in the past five years.  The company has strong top and bottom line growth which has translated into juicy profit margins. FY 2022 revenue reached $33.2 billion, representing 21% year-over-year growth. Net income also jumped to the tune of 70.7% year-over-year, from $6.7 billion to $11.5 billion. During the most recent earnings call, Broadcom’s leadership projected $8.9 billion in revenue for Q1 2023. Achieving this benchmark represents a 16% increase from last year.Rising profits and revenue suggest more dividend hikes to come, and recent news further supports Broadcom’s long-term viability.

The stock’s performance has been sideways over the past two years, but it is up over 70% over the past five years. Visa is one of the premier credit card companies alongside Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and American Express (NYSE:AXP). However, Visa has better profit margins than both credit card companies and a lower P/E ratio than Mastercard, the closest competitor. Visa currently has a 30.05 P/E ratio supported by double-digit net income growth.Visa doesn’t have the best dividend yield right now if you are an income investor. While its yield is currently below 1%, the company’s dividend payout ratio of 21% suggests the company can comfortably maintain and grow the dividend in the future. Visa has raised its dividend by 40% in the past two years.The corporation’s business model revolves around credit and debit card transactions.

The firm carries a 28.13 P/E ratio with a net profit margin above 20% and a reasonable 1.14 PEG ratio. Although the company has defined how a generation finds information and does research, the company has faced headwinds recently. Google has posted multiple quarters of single-digit revenue growth which is a far cry from the peak of FAANG stocks. Revenue has been in the red for a few quarters, but Alphabet’s cost cutting efforts minimized losses in Q1 2023. Alphabet saw its net income slide 8.43% year-over-year in that quarter compared to a 34.0% year-over-year drop in the prior quarter. The stock may experience continued turbulence due to the economic environment. The growing cloud business and recent profits in that segment can help offset some of the slowdowns in advertising. However, Google remains an appealing long-term investment due to its presence in the online advertising industry and high profit margins.

Source: Marriott International.Marriott International said Monday it would expand into the “affordable midscale” hotel category in North America with a new hotel brand — which it hasn’t yet named. The world’s largest hotel company said it hopes the new brand will appeal to guests seeking extended stays, typically at least 15 days.“We’re in discussions with owners for more than 250 new development opportunities under this brand,” said Leeny Oberg, Marriott’s chief financial officer and executive vice president, development.Concord Hospitality, a hotel development and management company based in North Carolina, and Whitman Peterson, a real estate private equity company in California, plan to work with Marriott to break ground on three properties under the new brand this year. They expect openings in late 2024 or early 2025.The new brand will be Marriott’s 32nd. (Read Skift’s explainer on Marriott’s brand family for context.)It stands out mainly on its price for guests and costs for developers. Marriott’s other long-stay brands typically charge higher rates and involve higher costs to build and run.“The prototype model targets a build cost of $13 million to $14 million, requiring approximately 54,000 square feet of total building area for 124 studios,” the company said in a statement.rendering of guest room at new hotel brand coming from marriott in the extended stay categoryExpanding DownmarketThe latest brand signals that the world’s largest hotel may be expanding “downmarket” to attract more price-conscious travelers.The new brand will target an $80 a night rate and compete with other “affordable midscale” brands — an industry category in-between budget, or “economy,” hotels and premium, or “upper-midscale,” hotels. Examples of affordable midscale brands include IHG’s Candlewood Suites and Hawthorne Suites by Wyndham.In other words, Marriott’s new brand will be the company’s most affordable cost-per-room hotel brand in the U.S. and Canada. In Latin America, Marriott’s just-acquired City Express by Marriott — currently in Mexico and a few other countries — is cheaper in absolute dollars in its local markets.Story continuesMarriott’s other brands with mainly long-stay guests include Apartments by Marriott Bonvoy, which it just announced in November for the premium and luxury segments. They also include Residence Inn by Marriott, Element by Westin, TownePlace Suites by Marriott, and Marriott Executive Apartments.Extended-Stay Gold RushMarriott’s latest entry into extended stay follows in the wake of activity from its rivals as sector leaders believe blended travel is here to stay.In April, Hyatt announced an extended stay brand. Since October, Wyndham launched ECHO Suites by Wyndham, and BWH launched @Home by Best Western.Roughly a third of the construction pipeline for hotels in the U.S. is extended-stay projects, or roughly 30 percent of planned rooms, according to Lodging Econometrics.For context, read: “Why Every Hotel Company Wants an Extended Stay Brand Now.”Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"
103,08e1df55-948f-3b0d-9f49-2529f3a2d277,SNA,2023-06-05,Should You Think About Buying Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE:SNA) Now?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/think-buying-snap-incorporated-nyse-101244582.html,1685959964,STORY,['SNA'],"[Let's talk about the popular Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE:SNA). The company's shares saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NYSE over the last few months. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Snap-on’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for Snap-on What Is Snap-on Worth?According to my valuation model, Snap-on seems to be fairly priced at around 5.6% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Snap-on today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $275.13, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Snap-on’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What does the future of Snap-on look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. However, with a negative profit growth of -6.2% expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth certainly doesn’t appear to be a driver for a buy decision for Snap-on. This certainty tips the risk-return scale towards higher risk.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? SNA seems fairly priced right now, but given the uncertainty from negative returns in the future, this could be the right time to de-risk your portfolio. Is your current exposure to the stock beneficial for your total portfolio? And is the opportunity cost of holding a negative-outlook stock too high? Before you make a decision on the stock, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on SNA for a while, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. The stock appears to be trading at fair value, which means there’s less benefit from mispricing. In addition to this, the negative growth outlook increases the risk of holding the stock. However, there are also other important factors we haven’t considered today, which can help crystalize your views on SNA should the price fluctuate below its true value.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing Snap-on at this point in time.

104,82ea1a8f-d8c1-3478-b073-4aee48b6e157,VZ,2023-06-05,Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 63% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-communications-inc-nyse-vz-120025278.html,1685966425,STORY,['VZ'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in Verizon Communications implies that they have significant influence over the company's share priceThe top 25 shareholders own 39% of the company Recent sales by insiders To get a sense of who is truly in control of Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 63% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Verizon Communications. View our latest analysis for Verizon Communications ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Verizon Communications?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.Verizon Communications already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Verizon Communications, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Verizon Communications is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.3% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.9% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.0% of the company stock.On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Verizon CommunicationsThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Verizon Communications Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$37m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 37% stake in Verizon Communications. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Verizon Communications better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted   1 warning sign for Verizon Communications  you should be aware of.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

And for most market goers, that means watching the action on the Yahoo Finance app (which I strongly encourage you to download) from a beach, a park, or a pool.While the natural inclination is to ""sell in May and go away,"" I humbly say: please don't do that. Not just because we have bills to pay here, but because there is a litany of interesting stories to track in the markets. I would argue there are many more compelling stories for investors compared to Summer 2022.Here is a tiny sampling of things I am watching during a summer that probably won't involve me going to a beach, pool, or house party because well — investing ""stuff"" is all I got going for me. The order is totally random and not in order of importance.1. Target's stockShares have been hammered by close to 14% in the past two weeks since the company removed LGBTQ+ merchandise from its stores. The fear is consumer backlash means weakening sales and a missed second quarter. The company also caught a JP Morgan downgrade on concerns the restart of student loan payments in Sept. 1 will hurt sales.Unclear if there is a near-term catalyst to jumpstart Target's stock considering all of this, which comes after another tough quarter of sales.2. The economic impact of student loan repaymentsThe downgrade to Target's stock could be a canary-in-the-coal-mine indicator of what analysts and market strategists do this summer before the repayments begin. Are more retailer ratings cut? Do strategists trim their S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates and year-end price targets? How will markets react? The market reaction to the Target downgrade was modest, but can it continue?Story continuesMake no mistake, the payment restart will be a headwind for an economy that doesn't need one.Goldman Sachs estimates student loan repayments will subtract 0.2 percentage points from personal consumption expenditures growth this year if the loan forgiveness plan is struck down, or 0.1 percentage point if the plan stands.Jefferies economist Thomas Simons thinks at least $400 a month in spending capacity will be removed from the pockets of those with student loans.""So as we're now adding this back in to balance sheets that are already pretty strained by two years of very high inflation that's run significantly higher than wage growth, the capacity to absorb this in a lot of budgets I think is much worse now,"" Simons said on Yahoo Finance Live.3. AI StocksIt's time for investors to draw a differentiation in AI stocks. Not doing so could prove very painful to one's portfolio.On the one hand, you have credible companies infusing generative AI into their businesses to unlock efficiencies and win new business. I was very impressed by what HP CEO Enrique Lores told me about how AI will transform the personal computer starting in 2024. With that, the company and rival Dell could be winners of a PC refresh cycle in 2024.I was also surprised to learn from Hewlett Packard Enterprise CFO Tarek Robbiati that the company has secured $800 million in new AI-related business.I fancy we may hear something positive very soon from AMD on the generative AI front. Maybe not as Earth-shattering as Nvidia, but strong enough to excite investors.Salesforce has an AI investor day slated a week from today. And Cisco Live is underway in Las Vegas — AI discussions will probably be front and center here.Again, these are credible companies working on cool AI stuff for the benefit of investors.On the other end of the spectrum, you have companies such as c3.AI.The money-losing company is being attacked by short sellers —such as the super-thorough Ben Axler at Spruce Point— for suspect accounting standards. I think many on the Street are beginning to drill down into the fundamentals of these more fringe AI plays to avoid getting burned —much like when the SPAC bubble burst.I expect a summer of AI scrutiny, leading to a possible rotation into more credible AI stocks.4. Apple's stockApple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) kicks off today (our tech editor Dan Howley will have full live coverage from Apple HQ), and it's time to see these AR/VR glasses the company has been working on for umpteen years.Shares of the tech giant are up almost 40% year to date, in part due to hype building for another new product category for Apple. And, Apple is generally viewed as a safe-haven play.But listen to the team at Morgan Stanley, and you get the sense these glasses have been the bigger tailwind for Apple's stock.""We estimate the AR/VR headset market can grow to $100 billion by 2030, and expand 5x by 2037, to over $500 billion,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring said in a research note ahead of the event.I am not sold on Apple's AR/VR glasses given the expected super high price point. And, I know I am not the only one who's skeptical about Apple having amazing success with a category that has always proven challenging. And how are they doing with that HomePod?Could we see a post-WWDC summer swoon in Apple's stock as glasses hype fades and recession talk resurfaces?Don't rule it out.5. The FedThe Fed could singlehandedly cut summer vacations short if it raises interest rates at its June 14 meeting. Why? The market has bet on the Fed pausing on rate hikes at the meeting, with maybe one more hike for the cycle coming at the July 26 gathering.Hopes for a Fed pause have fed (no pun intended) the markets' naturally bullish inclination — the Nasdaq Composite is up more than 25% on the year. The FANG+ Index is up about 65%.If the Fed doesn't deliver a pause, it may be a Summer Reset for markets.And that is one trend you won't want to be watching from a no-cell-service zone like the beach.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Billionaires Are Crazy About These 5 Stocks. Investors seem to have ignored all the panic around debt ceiling and are instead salivating over the possibility that the Federal Reserve might stop increasing interest rates. If the US government successfully raises the debt ceiling and avoids default, the stock market could continue its positive trajectory for a while longer. On May 3, the Federal Reserve increased interest rates for the 10th consecutive time. However, the Fed indicated that these hikes may have reached their conclusion, partly due to concerns within the banking system. According to Jerome Powell, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, a reduction in bank lending would impede an economy that the central bank was already trying to regulate as part of a larger effort to control and alleviate high inflation.Despite lingering worries about a potential recession in the later part of 2023, which have persisted for around 10 to 11 months, there is currently a sense of investor optimism. This is driven by satisfactory earnings in the first quarter and the possibility of the Federal Reserve temporarily halting interest rate hikes, which sets the stage for a strong market in June. The U.S. economy is also showcasing remarkable strength, as indicated by key factors like GDP and employment. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, there was a rise of 339,000 in total nonfarm payroll employment in May. However, the unemployment rate also increased by 0.3 percentage points to reach 3.7%. The sectors that experienced job gains included professional and business services, government, health care, construction, transportation and warehousing, and social assistance. Furthermore, the recent solid performance of financial, industrial, and material sectors disproves the notion of an impending economic slowdown, as these cyclical stocks normally drop in value before an economic downturn.Story continuesDon't Miss: 10 Chinese Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up OnMorningstar's valuations suggest that investors can benefit from a portfolio that combines both value and growth investments, while reducing exposure to core investments. Both the value and growth categories are considered undervalued, although the growth category has become relatively less undervalued compared to the start of the year due to its strong performance so far. On the other hand, the core category is less appealing in comparison to the overall market average as it is closer to fair value. In terms of market capitalization, the valuations of large-cap stocks have slightly surpassed the market average due to their strong performance in the first quarter. On the other hand, mid-cap stocks are slightly below the overall market average in terms of valuations. However, small-cap stocks are notably undervalued, as they are currently trading at a significant 33% discount, as per Morningstar’s report. Amid the stock market swings, billionaire investors exhibit a strong affinity towards lucrative investment opportunities in the realm of high-quality stocks. As per Insider Monkey’s data, some of the top stocks favored by billionaires during Q1 2023 included Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Our Methodology Insider Monkey tracks billionaire-owned stocks and in this article, we selected the top 10 stocks that attracted the highest number of billionaire investors during the first quarter of 2023. We have also mentioned the overall hedge fund sentiment towards each stock as of Q1 2023. Billionaires Are Crazy About These 10 StocksImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayBillionaires Are Crazy About These Stocks10. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 144Number of Billionaire Investors: 21Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), an American company focused on mobility technology, is a highly sought-after stock among billionaires. In Q1 2023, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)’s revenue of $8.8 billion climbed 27.5% year-over-year, beating Wall Street estimates by $90 million. Year-over-year, gross bookings experienced a growth of 19%, and the Mobility and Delivery adjusted EBITDA margins achieved their highest quarterly levels to date. The number of monthly active platform consumers increased by 13%, reaching a total of 130 million. This growth was primarily fueled by an ongoing enhancement in consumer engagement with Uber’s Mobility services.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) was part of 144 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 135 funds in the prior quarter. Billionaire David Tepper's Appaloosa Management held a $190.2 million stake in Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) during Q1 2023. In addition to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), billionaires are loading up on Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) shares. RiverPark Large Growth Fund made the following comment about Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER): Uber was a top contributor in the quarter following better-than-expected 4Q results and 1Q guidance. Gross Bookings grew 19% year over year to $31 billion, driven by 31% Mobility Gross Bookings growth and 6% Delivery Growth Bookings growth. 4Q Adjusted EBITDA of $665 million, up $579 million year over year, significantly beating management’s $600-$630 million guidance. Management guided to continuing growth in 1Q for Gross Bookings (20%- 24% growth) and Adjusted EBITDA (of $660-$700 million).UBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with a greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates. Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now solidly profitable with the potential for substantial margin expansion and free cash flow generation to come. We view UBER as more than just ride sharing and food delivery, but also as a global mobility platform with the ability to sell to its 131 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as package and grocery delivery, travel, truck brokerage (the company had $1.5 billion in Freight revenue for 4Q22), and worker staffing for shift work. Given its $4 billion of unrestricted cash and $5 billion of investments, the company today has an enterprise value of $70 billion, indicating that UBER trades at 1.6x next year’s estimated revenue.”9.

The company is leading in most secular growth categories in computing, and especially artificial intelligence and super-computing parallel processing techniques for solving complex computational problems. Simply put. Nvidia’s computational power is a critical enabler of Al and therefore critical to Al adoption, in our view. As such, we believe Nvidia is a long-term high unit volume growth opportunity. During the period, NVIDIA reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that met expectations, as the company navigated. through an inventory correction associated with the broad macroeconomic slowdown. Moreover, management gave fiscal year earnings guidance that was better than analyst estimates. noting strong year-over-year growth in gaming and data centers.

The company's results for the fiscal Q2 exceeded expectations in terms of both revenue and earnings, exhibiting growth compared to the same period in the previous year. This positive outcome can be attributed to robust cross-border volume.On May 1, Barclays analyst Ramsey El-Assal raised the firm's price target on Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) to $272 from $270 and reiterated an Overweight rating on the shares.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 173 hedge funds were bullish on Visa Inc.

(NYSE:V) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“We trimmed Mastercard and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) to equal weights of the Portfolio. Mastercard and Visa operate as a duopoly in a large and growing market. Over the last 50 years, global personal consumer expenditures (PCE) has grown 7-9% annualized. We expect 4-5% long-term PCE growth going forward. Additionally, the shift from cash to credit continues unabated, with a total credit penetration of only approximately 50% globally.3 This shift provides Visa and Mastercard with another ~4-6% of growth. When combined with PCE, this gives both companies high-single-digit to low-double[1]digit revenue growth opportunities. This growth estimate is before accounting for growth amplifiers like the acceleration of e[1]commerce, the shift from offline to online, and additional services. Both companies enjoy extremely strong network effects that provide strong competitive advantages.We have trimmed Visa and Mastercard because their combined weight grew to over 12% of the Global Growth Portfolio because of their recent performance and to fund our increase in Amazon’s position size. We added to both positions when their prices were depressed due to cross-border transactions deteriorating materially from the pandemic. Cross-border volumes came roaring back when travel corridors reopened, and although we are several quarters removed from the cross-border nadir, Visa still grew volumes &gt;30% in 1Q23. Total cross-border volumes are now 132% of 2019 levels. At 4.5% each, both companies remain high conviction positions for Global Growth.”7. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 128Number of Billionaire Investors: 25Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is a highly favored stock among billionaires, with 25 billionaires holding the company's stock in the first quarter of 2023. On May 18, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPADS of $1.56, beating market estimates by $0.21. The revenue of $30.32 billion topped Wall Street consensus by $410 million. After Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) reported its March quarter results and expressed positive expectations for user and order growth in the June quarter, BofA analyst Joyce Ju reaffirmed a Buy rating on the stock on May 19. However, the analyst lowered the firm's price target on the shares from $144 to $132. During the earnings call, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) also revealed plans for a full spinoff of its Cloud unit, IPOs of Cainiao and Freshippo, and external financing for international e-commerce within the next 6 to 18 months. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 128 hedge funds were long Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), compared to 113 funds in the prior quarter. Billionaire Lei Zhang's Hillhouse Capital Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 3.7 million shares worth $386.7 million. L1 Long Short Fund made the following comment about Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) (Long +16%) shares performed strongly based on favorable sentiment surrounding China’s re-opening and indications from Chinese authorities that the prolonged restructuring process of Alibaba/Ant Financial was finally drawing to a close. The company remains a high-quality business with leading positions in both eCommerce and Public Cloud. We exited our position in January at around US$116 per share with the shares having rallied more than 90% since their early November lows and our China re-opening catalyst having played out. We subsequently re-entered the position in March with the shares having pulled back and with the company announcing a new organizational and governance structure. Alibaba has announced plans to split into six major business groups – Cloud Intelligence, Taobao Tmall, Local Services, Global Digital, Cainiao Smart Logistics and Digital Media and Entertainment Group. Each of these groups will be managed independently (separate CEO and board) and have the flexibility to raise external capital and potentially pursue separate IPOs. We believe this announcement is a strong catalyst to unlock the inherent sum-of-the-parts valuation discount in the company.”6. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 116Number of Billionaire Investors: 25UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) operates as a diversified health care company in the United States. In the first quarter of 2023, 25 billionaires held stakes in UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH). On April 14, the company reported a Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $6.26 and a revenue of $91.9 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.18 and $2.12 billion, respectively. On May 25, Piper Sandler analyst Jessica Tassan initiated coverage of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) with an Overweight rating and a $580 price target. Piper Sandler believes that the Optum businesses within UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) will play a crucial role in delivering consistent and exceptional earnings per share growth over the next ten years. The firm asserted that Optum will be the driving force shaping UnitedHealth's trajectory in the coming decade, serving as an increasingly important entry point to the broader enterprise.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 116 hedge funds were bullish on UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), compared to 110 funds in the earlier quarter. Billionaire Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is the biggest stakeholder of the company. Like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is on the radar of billionaire investors. Alger Spectra Fund made the following comment about UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is an integrated healthcare benefits company uniquely positioned to address rising healthcare costs for its customers, due to its vertical integration, size, and scale. The Optum health benefits services unit, which accounts for approximately 45% of the company’s operating earnings, in our view, has the potential to grow even further as customers look for ways to manage rising healthcare costs. During the period, shares detracted from performance due to several factors: 1) many 2022 healthcare winners with shorter duration profiles and persistent earnings profiles, such as UnitedHealth Group. underperformed in the first quarter of 2023, 2) uncertainty surrounding Medicare Advantage reimbursement levels from the Federal government in 2023, which will be determined later in the year, and 3) increased regulatory scrutiny in the form of potential Medicare Advantage audits across the industry. While these concerns have impacted UnitedHealth in the near-term, we believe company fundamentals remain intact given its large scale business model, competitive advantages, and medium to long- term growth prospects.” Click to continue reading and see Billionaires Are Crazy About These 5 Stocks.  Suggested articles:15 Best Healthcare Stocks To Buy Now20 Poorest Countries in Europe16 Best Retirement Communities in Florida Near the Beach Disclosure: None.

Vanguard’s Health Care ETF (NYSEARCA:VHT) is down 5% on the year, compared with a 10% year-to-date gain in the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index. Investors should view the current slump as an opportunity to take positions in leading healthcare stocks with growth potential.The current dip in healthcare stocks is largely due to investors pulling back after the pandemic when many companies saw their share prices more than double as the quest for a Covid-19 vaccine was front-and-center. However, many analysts view healthcare stocks as good bets during an economic downturn as the essential nature of medical care makes the companies and their shares recession-proof. Here are three of the most promising healthcare stocks for June 2023.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPfizer (PFE)Pfizer logo on Pfizer building. Pfizer is an American pharmaceutical corporation.Source: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.comPfizer (NYSE:PFE) is, of course, the leading pharmaceutical company behind many blockbuster medications. It was also one of the first to bring a Covid-19 vaccine to market. In 2022, the company sold $37.8 billion worth of its Covid-19 vaccine around the world. Pfizer also got good news recently when its Covid-19 antiviral pill was granted full approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.Yet despite all the positives, PFE stock has declined 30% over the last 12 months, including a pullback of 26% this year. Through five years, Pfizer’s share price is up a modest 10%. The decline over the last year has been due to concerns about waning sales of its Covid-19 vaccine now that the pandemic has ended. After racking up record annual sales of $100 billion in 2022, investors and analysts appear worried that the good times are over for the company.But Pfizer has other bestselling drugs on the market and a strong pipeline of new products in development. PFE stock also pays a generous dividend that yields 4.36%.UnitedHealth Group (UNH)The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comStory continuesUnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) has the distinction of being the largest healthcare company by revenue and the largest insurance company by net premiums in the entire world. This makes UNH stock a safe bet for investors as businesses and individuals prioritize paying their health insurance premiums in good economic times and bad. This helps to explain how UnitedHealth has grown to become one of the world’s largest companies.UNH stock has proven to be a long-term winner for investors with its share price having doubled in the past five years. Investors looking for opportunities to buy a quality stock on the dip can get UnitedHealth Group on the cheap right now with the company’s share price down 7% on the year and a decent price-earnings ratio of 22.

116,b7713224-8925-3166-84da-764beb911fca,APD,2023-06-05,3 Hydrogen Stocks to Make You the Millionaire Next Door,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-hydrogen-stocks-millionaire-next-134355998.html,1685367835,STORY,"['LIN', 'PLUG', 'APD']","[Hydrogen power is good, clean, and fun. The oxidation of hydrogen can power everything from cars to cities, and its only waste product is water. And hydrogen itself can be extracted from a huge variety of sources, as it is the most abundant atom in the universe. Hydrogen is everywhere, and investing in hydrogen stocks means taking advantage of abundance over scarcity.But hydrogen must still catch up with more carbon-intensive energy sources in our modern economy. It is less energy dense than oil, meaning you need more volume to get the same amount of power. And it is more prone to seeping out of pipes than natural gas. But despite these issues, hydrogen has continued to grow as a power source in America and the world. There are currently 1600 miles of hydrogen pipelines in America. And with green energy growing in demand, there could soon be much, much more.Hydrogen power is still poised to be the future energy as nations pledge to achieve net-zero greenhouse emissions. It can not only be a transition fuel, as it can use much of the same infrastructure as natural gas, but it can also be a net-zero fuel in and of itself. Also, hydrogen as a chemical is used in various industrial processes, the demand for which will continue to grow. This is an industry you don’t want to miss out on. So here are millionaire-making hydrogen stocks to get into right now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAir Products and Chemicals (APD)Air Products truck on motorway. APD stock.Source: Bjoern Wylezich / ShutterstockAir Products and Chemicals (NYSE:APD) has become the world’s largest seller of hydrogen and a top hydrogen stock to buy. This company uses hydrogen not only as a power source but also as a chemical for creating several products. A good example is their Neom green hydrogen joint venture with ACWA power, using hydrogen to produce both energy and ammonia. Saudi Arabia plans for Neom to be a “city of the future” powered by 100% renewable energy. And this venture places Air Products as a prime supplier of that energy.Story continuesAir Products is a strong stock for growth and passive income. Its Q1 2023 earnings reported revenue of $3.2 billion, up from $2.9 billion, with an expected dividend rate of 2.4%. With both good growth prospects and a dividend, this is one of the best hydrogen stocks for millionaire status.Furthermore, the Biden administration promises big money to green hydrogen companies. And because of that, air Products is set to be a major beneficiary as they are bringing online some of the largest green hydrogen plants in America alongside partners like AES (NYSE:AES).Air Products and Chemicals currently sits as the proverbial 600-pound gorilla of the global hydrogen market. With plants and contracts around the globe, they are on course for explosive growth as governments pump more and more money into green energy. That makes them a hydrogen stock you don’t want to miss out on.Linde PLC (LIN)Production operator communicate between central control room by using radio to operate ball valve at offshore oil and gas processing platform for control gases and liquid crude oil process. Energy Stocks. CEI stockSource: Oil and Gas Photographer / Shutterstock.comLinde PLC (NYSE:LIN) is making a big play for the future of green hydrogen. While much of the world’s hydrogen is produced from natural gas, this process releases carbon dioxide. If the carbon dioxide can be sequestered, the process is carbon neutral. But sequestering carbon dioxide is an expensive endeavor in and of itself; it is far more efficient to produce the hydrogen without producing carbon dioxide.That is precisely what Linde plans to do as one of the leading producers of proton exchange membranes. These will produce hydrogen directly from electrolysis, emitting no greenhouse gasses. With their green hydrogen production, alongside a hefty $1.8 billion investment in hydrogen production in Texas, Linde is quickly establishing itself as one of the most prominent players in hydrogen. This makes them a definite buy for anyone investing in hydrogen stocks.Financially, Linde is well-positioned for the road ahead. With $8.2 billion in revenue and $1.5 billion in net income in Q1 2023, they are prepared to invest heavily in the upcoming hydrogen revolution.As a final note, Linde has eyes on using hydrogen to replace even gasoline. As a member of the Hydrogen Council, Linde has pushed for the production of hydrogen-powered cars to replace gasoline-powered ones. With the possibility of lithium shortages looming over the electric car industry, there is still room for an outside bet like hydrogen cars to supply our green transition. If that happens, Linde would again be first in line to benefit.Plug Power (PLUG)Plug Power logo on computer screen. PLUG stock.Source: Postmodern Studio / ShutterstockPlug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) has been a volatile and sometimes heartbreaking stock for its investors. But Plug has perhaps the greatest growth potential of all hydrogen stocks for investors looking to hit the big time in hydrogen.Part of Plug’s appeal is that it produces hydrogen by a less-traveled road. Producing hydrogen from methane creates carbon dioxide. Producing hydrogen from water is electrically intensive. But Plug Power is producing hydrogen using the waste produced by chloralkali production. As they are reusing a waste product, this lets Plug tap into a potentially very low-cost source of hydrogen.Another part of their appeal is the promise that they will bring hydrogen power to every corner of the market that can use it. From buses to airplanes, Plug has shown a commitment to using its hydrogen anywhere it can. The company knows that this could truly be the energy source of the future. The low-carbon fuel for when wind and solar power aren’t available.On the financial front, however, Plug does merit a word of caution. Q1 2023 revenue was 50% higher than Q1 2022, going from $141 million to $270 million. But that growth still couldn’t bring profit, and net losses grew as well from $35 million to $69 million. Plug still has $475 million in cash, so they still have time to find profit. But cautious investors may have reason to wait until they prove they can do so. Still, with such high potential in a growing market, Plug at least deserves to be on any hydrogen investor’s watch list.On the date of publication, John Blankenhorn did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

117,7bd914b9-4d33-3481-8b64-8494b2e7e23a,CMI,2023-06-05,"With 85% institutional ownership, Cummins Inc. (NYSE:CMI) is a favorite amongst the big guns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/85-institutional-ownership-cummins-inc-110048802.html,1685962848,STORY,['CMI'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Cummins' stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsThe top 25 shareholders own 50% of the company Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a businessTo get a sense of who is truly in control of Cummins Inc. (NYSE:CMI), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 85% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Cummins. Check out our latest analysis for Cummins ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Cummins?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Cummins. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Cummins, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Cummins. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.5% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.6% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.6% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 25 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of CumminsWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Cummins Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$139m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 15% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Cummins.

It added that foreign exchange headwinds have increased.Story continuesMonday's statement stands in contrast to comments from the company on April 25, when it said it had started the year ""in line with our guidance"", pointing at the time to a strong momentum despite economic uncertainty.While Viaplay also issued a profit warning last year, the size and scope of the latest downgrade still came as a shock, analysts at Jefferies said in a note to clients.Among Viaplay's Nordic subscription offers are football rights such as the English Premier League and car racing, including Formula 1.It expects second-quarter sales of between 4.5 billion Swedish crowns and 4.6 billion Swedish crowns. It also expects to have 7.7 million subscribers at the end of the second quarter which compares with 7.6 million for the first quarter.Viaplay's shares fell 58.6% by 0831 GMT to 93.40 Swedish crowns.

(NYSE:OKE) as an investment opportunity by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for ONEOK Crunching The NumbersWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.37bUS$2.32bUS$3.45bUS$3.86bUS$4.20bUS$4.49bUS$4.73bUS$4.94bUS$5.13bUS$5.30bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x3Analyst x2Est @ 11.80%Est @ 8.89%Est @ 6.86%Est @ 5.43%Est @ 4.44%Est @ 3.74%Est @ 3.25% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 11% US$2.1kUS$1.9kUS$2.5kUS$2.6kUS$2.5kUS$2.4kUS$2.3kUS$2.2kUS$2.1kUS$1.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$23bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 11%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$5.3b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (11%– 2.1%) = US$63bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$63b÷ ( 1 + 11%)10= US$23bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$45b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$58.7, the company appears quite good value at a 42% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at ONEOK as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 11%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.443. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for ONEOKStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.Dividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Oil and Gas industry.OpportunityAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For ONEOK, there are three additional aspects you should further research:Risks: For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for ONEOK (1 can't be ignored!) that you should be aware of before investing here.Future Earnings: How does OKE's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

125,b34df12e-65e3-3589-b39a-8b89478b6a3e,CL,2023-06-05,The 7 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for Your Grandchildren,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-best-dividend-stocks-buy-221536455.html,1685398536,STORY,['CL'],"[With the economy facing the prospect of a recession irrespective of the at-time-of-writing debt ceiling drama, investors may want to consider the top dividend stocks for future generations. Fundamentally, companies that enjoy a long track record of success (and facilitating passive income) stand a better chance of weathering the storm. In addition, those companies that reward their shareholders with regular income are more able to mitigate downside. After all, those payouts must come from somewhere. So, a business that’s able to provide passive income usually aligns with a relevant industry. Therefore, you usually don’t go wrong with the best long-term dividend stocks.To be sure, nothing in the market or life offers guarantees. However, if you’re worried about both current events and things that haven’t happened yet, these are the dividend stocks for generational wealth that should serve your family (and your descendants) well.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsArcher Daniels Midland (ADM)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comA multinational food processing and commodities trading firm, Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) almost provides a no-brainer for top dividend stocks for future generations. Basically, the company guarantees itself permanent relevance because of its core business. I’ve said this before but no matter how advanced we become as a society, we humans will require basic goods. Obviously, food’s one of them.Specifically for best long-term dividend stocks, I like ADM even better. According to Dividend.com, Archer Daniels carries a forward yield of 2.47%. Although it’s not the most generous source of passive income, it does beat the consumer staple sector’s average yield of 1.89%. Also, its payout ratio sits at just under 27%, which translates to strong confidence in yield sustainability.Another factor that will likely prevent management from messing with the passive income is its 51 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. You don’t want to be the executive that lost Archer Daniels its status as a dividend king. Thus, it’s an easy choice for dividend stocks for generational wealth.Story continuesColgate-Palmolive (CL)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large text.Source: iQoncept/shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Midtown Manhattan, Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) is one of the world’s top consumer product companies. Fundamentally, Colgate offers a similar magnitude of relevance to Archer Daniels. No matter what happens in the future, we’ll need to take care of our teeth. Given the company’s importance to everyday basic care, CL is another no-brainer for top dividend stocks for future generations.To be sure, Colgate itself symbolizes a boring company in a boring industry. However, that’s part of CL’s charm, especially under present circumstances. Right now, the company carries a forward yield of 2.52%, again above the average yield of the consumer staples sector. Colgate’s payout ratio is significant higher than ADM’s at just under 56%. Nevertheless, that’s a reasonable ratio all things considered. Just as well, CL features 61 years of consecutive dividend increases. Again, you don’t want to be the person responsible for removal of dividend king status. Thus, it’s a dependable idea for dividend-paying stocks for family legacy.Sempra (SRE)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockOn a financial and political level, many investors might argue that utility giant Sempra (NYSE:SRE) does not belong on this list of top dividend stocks for future generations. First, Sempra doesn’t enjoy brilliant “paper” stats. For example, its Altman Z-Score – which is a predictor of bankruptcy – sits at 1.07, representing a distressed enterprise. On the political side, many folks have decided to leave California, of which Sempra dominates the southern region. Therefore, consistently unfavorable migration trends, SRE doesn’t seem a wise investment for best long-term dividend stocks.However, utility firms generally don’t have sterling financials. Instead, they command natural monopolies. As for the politics, listen – California being a coastal state to the critical Pacific ocean, it will always be relevant. Always, always, always – take it to the bank if you want. Finally, Sempra carries a forward yield of 3.31%. While it’s a bit lower than the utility sector’s average yield of 3.75%, its payout ratio is reasonable at 49.73%. As well, it enjoys 19 years of consecutive dividend increases.Microsoft (MSFT)Source: ShutterstockTo be fair, most investors probably don’t pick up shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to make it rich. Rather, the technology stalwart provides a reliable canvas for capital gains and a modest amount of passive income. However, as an idea for top dividend stocks for future generations, MSFT holds its own. It’s not sexy but I’m almost certain it will be around for the next 100 years.Fundamentally, Microsoft Windows continues to hold a dominant position regarding desktop operating system market share. To be fair, this metric slipped sharply since the end of last year but it remains impressive at 62.65%. Also, Microsoft has its hands in myriad other platforms and innovations so it’s not going anywhere.In terms of passive income, MSFT might seem like a joke based on its forward yield of 0.82%. However, the company also enjoys 20 years of consecutive dividend increases. As well, its payout ratio sits at 24.68%, offering maximum confidence regarding yield sustainability. Plus, Microsoft continues to be a growth machine. Per Gurufocus, its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 17.4%, above 71.21% of the competition.IBM (IBM)sheet of paper marked ""dividends"" with a $20 bill on top of it to represent dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockOne of the biggest names in the tech ecosystem, IBM (NYSE:IBM) also features a rich history, founded in 1911. For full disclosure, IBM ranks among the more volatile entities in recent sessions. Since the beginning of this year, shares of “Big Blue” fell nearly 9%. In the trailing year, they’re down more than 7%. Still, IBM may qualify as one of the top dividend stocks for future generations.For quite some time, IBM fell under pressure because of its exposure to legacy business units that progressively became less relevant. However, in recent years, its evolving management team aggressively pushed into pertinent arenas, such as hybrid cloud. Also, it’s a powerhouse in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Over the next decades, IBM should really be a dominant player.While you’re waiting for this narrative to pan out, IBM also ranks as one of the high-yield stocks for grandchildren. Sure, there are companies that offer higher rates of passive income but IBM’s forward yield of 5.15% is contextually reliable. Business-wise, it continues to expand into relevant sectors. Also, it features 30 years of consecutive payout increases, making it one of the popular dividend aristocrats.Iron Mountain (IRM)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockAn enterprise information management service, Iron Mountain (NYSE:IRM) focuses on multiple critical needs. These include records management, information destruction and data backup and recovery services. According to its public profile, as of 2020, over 94% of Fortune 1000 companies used Iron Mountain’s services to store and manage their information in some capacity.Moving forward, I see IRM’s relevance only rising, making it one of the top dividend stocks for future generations. Sure, the company’s digital protection services will undoubtedly thrive as more of our data hits the cloud. However, the biggest companies and the most critical organizations will hit up Iron Mountain for physical document and equipment storage.Basically, stuff happens. Plus, the smartest hacker in the world wouldn’t be able to crack paper documents. Almost as a bonus, IRM also ranks among the high-yield stocks for grandchildren. Currently, Iron Mountain carries a forward yield of 4.62%. However, sustainability might be an issue because of its sky-high payout ratio. Still, the long-term relevancy is a strong selling point.Chevron (CVX)dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockOn surface level, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) might seem the most controversial name on this list of dividend stocks for generational wealth. After all, go-green advocates have repeatedly stated that electric vehicles are the future. And they very well might be but probably for rich people. You have to at least consider the possibility that hydrocarbons may be around for a very long time.First, you must consider the science. Like it or not, hydrocarbons command high energy density. In fairness, scientists continue to conduct intense research and development to improve the energy density of EV batteries, among other key attributes. However, such tech costs plenty of money – money that regular folks even at scale might not be able to afford.In addition, as relatively new tech, EVs will likely foster social inequities. Basically, the rich will be able to afford fast-charging EVs that deliver 600 miles of total range while everyone else may be left with electric clunkers. For this and many other reasons, Chevron should still be relevant a century from now. Plus, its 3.92% forward yield makes it one of the best long-term dividend stocks.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at Comcast’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for Comcast Is Comcast Still Cheap?Great news for investors – Comcast is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $63.94, but it is currently trading at US$39.19 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Comcast’s share price also seems relatively stable compared to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. If you believe the share price should eventually reach its true value, a low beta could suggest it is unlikely to rapidly do so anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range.Can we expect growth from Comcast?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Comcast's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since CMCSA is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on CMCSA for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy CMCSA. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.If you want to dive deeper into Comcast, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

The parent company of Burger King and Tim Horton’s among other banners, has garnered a “moderate buy” consensus recommendation from twelve research firms due to its strong earnings report.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThat may not sound like a resounding buy call. However, there’s a reason for the optimism. The company exceeded earnings expectations with an EPS of C$1.01, surpassing the consensus estimate by C$0.16. The company’s revenue for the quarter also exceeded analyst estimates at C$2.15 billion. These impressive results highlight the effectiveness of Restaurant Brands’ international business strategy.Restaurant Brands had a strong Q1, surpassing earnings expectations. Its revenue increased by 9.7% year-over-year to $1.59 billion, exceeding estimates by $30 million. The company’s earnings per share of 75 cents were 11 cents higher than predicted. Despite macro challenges, Restaurant Brands achieved growth in comparable and system-wide sales, making it a positive start to the year.Burger King is seeing record sales of Whoppers due to a viral marketing campaign. Tim Hortons has refreshed its menu and loyalty program, becoming the most popular food and drink app in Canada. Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen experienced 5.6% same-store sales growth in Q1 with the return of Ghost Pepper Wings, while Firehouse Subs saw a 6.1% rise in same-store sales.Story continuesDeere (DE)An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""Source: PX Media / ShutterstockDeere (NYSE:DE), a farm equipment manufacturer, is among the generational buying opportunities on my list right now. The company is capitalizing on increased farmer income due to high food prices, resulting in greater demand for Deere’s machinery.Deere delivered impressive results in the first quarter with a 32% increase in revenue and a significant rise in net income. With a low forward price-earnings ratio of 13-times, DE stock stands out as a top contender for a spectacular rally among short-squeeze stocks. Deere delivered an exceptional quarter, surpassing revenue and earnings expectations. However, the stock experienced volatility, fluctuating by over $31 per share in a single trading day.Deere stock is becoming increasingly undervalued and presents a compelling low-risk investment opportunity.

Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7From 2015 to 2020, oil stocks lagged behind the S&amp;P 500 due to a lack of capital discipline during a period of declining oil prices. However, companies in the industry have shifted their focus towards prioritizing returns to shareholders and implementing capital discipline. Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) stands out as a pioneer in adopting this model.Devon Energy stock dropped 17% in the past year amid falling crude oil prices and recession fears from Federal Reserve rate hikes. Despite this, the International Energy Agency forecasts record petroleum demand growth and declining global supplies, potentially pushing prices back to $100 per barrel. Billionaire investor Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates holds an $11.1 million stake in DVN stock, indicating confidence in its long-term prospects.Devon Energy has announced a quarterly dividend of $0.72 per share for shareholders of DVN stock, payable on June 30th. Shareholders as of June 15th will be eligible for this dividend, which amounts to an annual dividend of $2.88 per share.Devon Energy reported impressive Q1 earnings on May 8th, with operating revenues exceeding $3 billion and a net margin of over 31%. This translates to earnings per share of $1.46, surpassing Wall Street’s consensus estimate of $1.39.

130,864a8485-f7ca-3149-9027-46a17ab60025,MU,2023-06-05,Global Impact: Washington's chip restrictions grow longer by the day. Why is China adding to the list?,South China Morning Post,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-impact-washingtons-chip-restrictions-093000693.html,1685957400,STORY,['MU'],"[Turnabout is fair play. That must be the mood in Beijing right now after the Cyberspace Administration of China concluded its security review into Micron last month, ruling that the last company producing memory chips in the US poses a risk and can no longer sell to key information infrastructure operators, a broad category that effectively bars all sales in the country.This cybersecurity review unfolded pretty quickly. Compare it to the one against Didi Chuxing, one of the first examples of Beijing using this power. The government effectively left China's ride-hailing champion to twist in the wind for more than a year after it went public in the US.Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.The Micron investigation, on the other hand, was just launched in March. This was Beijing's big push back against Washington's escalating chip export restrictions to China (which, including collaboration with allies, seem to get stricter by the month).However, the move betrays the limited options available to Beijing. Micron chips are comparatively easy to replace. While Washington has urged South Korea to not let rivals Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix fill the market gap in Micron's absence, there is no guarantee they will not benefit.China also sees room to boost domestic companies, especially the country's largest memory chip maker, Yangtze Memory Technologies Corp (YMTC), despite the company being sanctioned by Washington.With signs that the market for memory chips may be bottoming out, YMTC has moved earlier than rivals to increase prices on its 3D NAND flash memory.There have already been some immediate effects of the Micron ban. China's top server makers, including Inspur and Lenovo, told suppliers to stop shipping components with the US company's chips.Story continuesNews of the ban also helped boost shares of domestic chip companies, which surged on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges. Something similar happened in March when the launch of the Micron probe pushed the CNI Chip Index up by over 5 per cent.Lest the market get too excited, though, Beijing moved quickly to taper expectations of further escalation. Nationalist tabloid, the Global Times, described the move as an individual case, and China's minister of commerce said the country still welcomes US business investment.A telling sign of the limits of Beijing's retaliatory options is its decision so far to avoid targeting logic chips like those from Intel, Qualcomm and Nvidia. Domestic production capabilities of advanced logic chips remain much further behind, and those chips are needed to power servers, smartphones and artificial intelligence applications. China's AI ambitions have already been set back by restrictions on certain Nvidia chips.Beijing has also been frustrated by Washington's multilateral approach to countering China's technological advance. Beyond just South Korea, the US has been working with Japan and the Netherlands to ensure its export restrictions are enforced.Last month, China's Ministry of Commerce condemned Japan's decision to update export controls to cover 23 types of chip-making technology, affecting around 10 companies. The move will ""severely damage"" the two countries' ""economic and trade cooperation"", the ministry said.Experts say the move will further constrain China's ability to expand chip production capacity, especially at the 20-nanometre level and more advanced.Meanwhile, Japan could be set to help Micron expand to the tune of US$1.5 billion in financial incentives for a new plant in the country. The company is also expanding in the US, where it is building a plant in New York.In an effort to show it still has clout with its neighbours, China issued a statement last month saying it had reached an agreement with South Korea during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation trade ministers' meeting in Detroit to boost semiconductor cooperation.Seoul made no mention of ""cooperation"", saying only that the two countries had discussed stabilising the supply and demand of raw materials and parts.Another risk for Beijing is that the Micron ban could result in additional blowback, even as Washington already seems intent on pushing the limits of trade restrictions.One American lawmaker said the US should take action against Changxin Memory Technologies (CXMT). This is one of the dynamic random-access memory chip makers that analysts said could benefit from Micron's absence.Last year, CXMT CEO Zhu Yiming warned of the harms from anti-globalisation sentiment, and now it seems his fears could be realised, just as one of his biggest foreign rivals is pushed out of the domestic market.China bans Micron chips for 'severe cybersecurity risks', drawing rebuke from Washington as tech war revs upBeijing moves to limit collateral damage from Micron sales ban with muted reaction from consumersChina shows the sword to US chipmaker Micron with ban, opening the door to local players to fill the gapMicron gauges the damage after China's sales ban, as South Korean firms stand to fill its voidChina says South Korea agrees to boost semiconductor cooperation, while Seoul stays quiet on talksOpinion: When it comes to chips, there is simply no pleasing WashingtonNvidia founder tells Taiwan graduates to seize the 'golden opportunities' of the AI revolution, which has only just begunIntel inside?

three days - to the US firm being put under investigation by the Cyber Security Review Office under the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) on national security grounds.Read morePhoto: Shutterstock alt=Photo: Shutterstock&gt;China's YMTC making progress in producing advanced 3D NAND chips with local equipmentYMTC's top secret project, which aims to use Chinese-only equipment, has placed big orders with domestic tool suppliers, including Beijing-based Naura TechnologyThe ramped up sourcing of local equipment comes after YMTC received fresh funding to the tune of US$7 billion from its state-backed investors, including the 'Big Fund'Chinese chip maker Yangtze Memory Technologies Corp (YMTC) is planning to use domestically sourced equipment to make advanced flash memory products after it was put on a US trade blacklist last year, according to industry sources.If successful, the strategy would represent a breakthrough in China's efforts to become self-sufficient in semiconductor production after the country was denied access to advanced chip making tools over Washington's concerns that the technology would end up in the hands of the Chinese military.Read morePhoto: Shutterstock alt=Photo: Shutterstock&gt;Chinese chip maker YMTC slashes equipment orders amid US sanctions, market headwindsYMTC has slashed up to 70 per cent of its orders from Naura Technology, a Chinese maker of production tools for wafer fabs, according to a sourceThe cancelled orders come amid tighter US export restrictions on China's chip industry, as well as a slowdown in the global memory marketChina's top memory chip maker Yangtze Memory Technologies Corp (YMTC) has significantly cut orders for production equipment in recent months, according to an industry source, a sign that its expansion plans have been dealt a major blow by Washington's efforts to deny Chinese access to advanced chip-making technologies.Based in Wuhan, capital of central Hubei province, YMTC has slashed up to 70 per cent of its orders from Naura Technology Group, a leading Chinese maker of etching, cleaning and chemical vapour deposition tools for wafer fabs, according to a source familiar with the matter, who declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak with media.Read morePhoto: Reuters alt=Photo: Reuters&gt;Chinese chip firms stockpile equipment ahead of US-Japan-Netherlands agreementSome of China's largest chip makers have scrambled to buy equipment and materials this year in anticipation of an agreement expected to further curb accessJapanese firms are continuing to fulfil orders while they await clarity on new rules expected in AprilChinese semiconductor companies are scrambling to stockpile chip-making equipment, spare parts and other related materials, while overseas firms continue to fulfil orders as they await clarity on tighter export rules resulting from coordination between the US, Japan and the Netherlands, according to industry insiders.Some of the country's largest chip firms have been ramping up stockpiling this year after news that Washington had reached an agreement with Tokyo and The Hague to help enforce export restrictions, which the US upgraded in October to become a de facto ban on sales to China of advanced chip-making gear. The move has fanned concerns among buyers in the country that they would continue to face escalating curbs on equipment purchases, according to two people involved in the semiconductor supply chain, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.Read moreStarved of chips, China faces 'unprecedented' pressure to become No 1 economyUS technology containment has led some international organisations to delay - if not drop entirely - forecasts that China will become the world's No 1 economyChina's digital economy accounts for 39.8 per cent of gross domestic product, but for it to power future growth, the country needs high-end semiconductor chipsSemiconductor chips are often compared to the beating heart driving technology innovation.

Rowe Price:PRIDE @ T. Rowe Price, our associate-led business resource group (BRG), is hosting an event focused on how inclusive storytelling principles and active listening can help build a safer, more inclusive workplace and support the LGBTQ+ community in the ongoing struggle for inclusion and equality.As we mark Pride Month as both a personal and communal celebration of visibility, perseverance, and dignity, a few of our associates highlighted the importance of creating space to share their lived experiences as members and allies of the LGBTQ+ community.Christian Cephas, Administrative Services Team Lead, Technology Business ManagementPride to me means living life every day as my true, authentic self, without the fear or worry of the thoughts and opinions of those around me. I'm a pansexual transgender African American male, and there are so many different boxes that I don't fit into that someone meeting me for the first time would never know at first glance. And honestly, I love it because it has allowed me to enter many spaces that others like me have not been able to join to advocate and educate about the LGBTQ+ community and beyond. I take pride in the many layers of me and hope that I can continue to use my voice and platform to educate others.Emily Davidson, Brand Historian and Corporate ArchivistUntil the Bi-Visibility Day event last year, I felt invisible as an LGBTQ+ person-at work, out in the world, even within the PRIDE BRG-because I'm ""just"" bisexual and my partner of over five years is a man. When I'm walking down the street holding his hand, I'm being my authentic queer self, but the world sees me as just another heterosexual woman. In the past, when I've been out with a woman, I'm just another lesbian at the farmer's market. I've known who I am for a long time. I'm not confused or closeted. It's not ""just a phase."" So this year, I've decided to own my identity (even if no one else can see it) and accept that, yes, Pride is for me too.Story continuesMary Louise (ML) Dixon, Regional Investment Consultant, U.S. IntermediariesAll my life I've embraced my identity in communities that tend to be more resistant to change, whether it is living in affluent suburban areas of New England or spending my career in financial services. What I have found is that telling my story not only breaks down stereotypes and misconceptions for those with minimal exposure to the LGBTQ+ community, but it also provides a sense of belonging and validation for those struggling on a similar journey. In light of recent patterns of discrimination across the country, hopefully my voice can help change a few minds to broader acceptance and inclusivity. I take pride in representing a firm like T. Rowe Price that made diversity an initiative long before it was an industrywide trend.Jen Fox, Client Processing SupervisorPride Month remains, for me, a celebration of evolution and understanding in my life. From watching a good friend's mom come out in the 90s, to supporting my sister's fiancé though his transition, I have been able to watch personal stories grow and bloom into beautiful lives. My own narrative was a very quiet one for a long time. Spending my teens and 20s figuring out myself and my relationship to the world as a bisexual woman was challenging, but coming to T. Rowe Price has presented me with an opportunity to not only feel confident in my own sexuality, but also supported by and welcomed into a community. This June, I plan on continuing to hold myself up and make room for others so that we can all bring our full, inclusive selves to our everyday lives.Nia Grant, Senior Administrative Assistant, Global Information OrganizationPride Month is a celebration of self. After living in the closet for so long, having a whole month dedicated to celebrating, sharing, and loving with the community is everything. Not everyone is able to and not everyone is accepting, so being in a space with loving and supporting friends and families helps to build and maintain our community.Ronald Mora, Senior Analyst, Data Management and ReportingTo be a first-generation American is to be aware early in life about the disadvantages and privileges you are raised with. The struggles of immigrant parents to pursue a better life were continually acknowledged during my upbringing. While I was raised to understand these disadvantages in reference to myself, as a queer man of color, I had to face new and unknown challenges about my identity without the help of my traditional family. Facing these new struggles forced me to not only grow myself, but to also build my own queer community to share the burden we all face. Throughout all of this, I have repeatedly learned the value of engaging with the LGBTQ+ communities around me to not only support myself, but to help those who find themselves in positions I have encountered. Having the space and support at T. Rowe Price through the PRIDE @ T. Rowe Price BRG allows me to not only learn more from my queer colleagues, but to also continue mentoring and advocating for their goals and challenges.Matthias Schmidt, Managing Legal CounselBeing out and proud is something I wear as a badge of honor. I am extremely happy that I have reached a point in my life in which I want to be my unapologetic self without any excuses. In my life, I have been on different sides of the closet, and this experience taught me that feelings can change and that this is OK as long as you stay true to yourself and that you don't forget that it's your life and your story and you don't need to justify it to anyone but yourself. My advice to everyone is: Love yourself, be yourself, and enjoy life because it's great. Happy Pride!Cory Yeboah, Brand MarketerTo me, Pride is an act of resistance through queer joy. It's our collective, unapologetic moment to bask in the sun regardless of whatever hate or circumstances we face. My journey to living authentically was dark and marred with shame and self-doubt. Even when I did come out, I still felt like I had to put myself in a box to be accepted. It wasn't until I found safe spaces where I could truly be seen that I came to understand the power of being me unapologetically.Joie Young-Broin, Compliance Specialist, Special Correspondence GroupPride, in many ways, was a foreign concept to me when I was just coming out, because, like so many people in the community, I had been taught that who I was was something to be ashamed of. Instead of announcing who I was ""loud and proud,"" I whispered my truth with fear and hope. My time at T. Rowe Price has been a big part of my journey to fully embracing Pride; it is the first workplace where I felt able to be fully out. The individual and institutional support I received was, in many ways, life changing. It wasn't always a grand gesture; in fact, it was mostly small showings of support and quiet conversations. Small steps transforming into revolutionary changes, mutual support, and a vast supply of hope-that's what Pride means to me.As we celebrate Pride Month and other celebrations of diversity, we invite you to learn more about our diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives and how our differences bring us together at troweprice.com/diversity.T.

Barr, the Fed vice chair for supervision, added that the central bank was ""carefully considering"" rule changes for larger regional banks.Randal Quarles, who led Fed regulations before Barr, cautioned in a 2021 speech that fully implementing the remaining Basel requirements could result in capital requirements increases of as much as 20% for the largest banks.The Wall Street Journal reported that the precise amount of capital requirements will depend on a bank's business, with U.S. megabanks with big trading businesses expected to face the largest increases.Banks such as Morgan Stanley and credit card giant American Express that are heavily dependent on fee income, such as from investment banking or wealth management, could also face large capital increases, the Journal reported.Morgan Stanley and American Express did not immediately respond to requests for comment by Reuters.

For more Warren Buffett stocks, head on over to 5 Warren Buffett Stocks Other Billionaires Are Loading Up On. Within a couple of years, investing in the stock market has become quite tricky. As the coronavirus pandemic hit the world in full force and lockdowns were imposed, investors lost billions of dollars on the market as economic sentiment was sapped. However, within a year, the market recovered and technology stocks boomed as work from home mandates changed the dynamics behind the demand for consumer products.Then, just as investors were taking a sigh of relief, the historic inflationary cycle and the Russian invasion of Ukraine jostled the world once again in 2022. This effectively divided the market into two halves. One of these was the high growth technology stocks that bled large portions of their value. The other was commodities and energy companies that saw remarkable highs. For the prudent investor, playing the macroeconomic environment would have led to significant gains even as countless others lamented their losses and licked their wounds.This year, all anyone can talk about is a recession. The Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hiking cycle that kicked off last year is designed to slow down the economy to cut down wages and reduce spending power to bring down prices. A consequence of this is a significant economic slowdown that can lead to a prolonged drop in growth which can in certain scenarios be described as recessionary.So, what does one do to invest during these times? Well, one approach is to take a look at what the professionals are doing. And the professional of professionals is none other than the Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway. Berkshire is one of the largest investment holding companies in America, and Mr. Buffett has seen his firm's share price grow by thousands of percentage points over the past couple of decades. A class A share of Berkshire, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), is the most expensive share on the stock market with one share being worth a stunning $492,000 as of June 2023. This same share was worth $985 in 1983, Accounting for inflation, $985 in 1983 would be worth $3,000 today, so it's safe to say that Mr. Buffett's firm has done a lot of things right over these past few decades.Story continuesOver the past couple of months. Mr. Buffett has shared his take on the economy several times. During an interview with CNBC a month back, he provided insights into which businesses might do well and those that were struggling. Some of his favorites, as usual, were in the insurance industry. The legendary investor's remarks were as follows:Well I know what a lot of different businesses is doing, and I just got a report from one of them that happens to be in the retail end of this. It was minus 22% in February from the year ago. In sales, profits are down a lot more than that. On the other hand, some of our businesses are doing fine, but they all are reporting that, some of them are living off of orders that were placed months earlier and that sort of thing. But, it's a tougher world out there in a great many businesses. Not in the insurance business. Insurance business should be better this year than last year. That doesn't mean it will be, because we can't predict everything that happens, but on a probability basis, it should be better than last year. And the railroad business is down, and [inaudible]. But it isn't dramatic, and of course we got the utility business, and that doesn't read very much with things. But, overall, I think people that run our business, that do have any sensitivity to the economy are surprised where they are now compared to where they felt they would be six months ago. But that doesn't mean the world is coming to an end or anything. Fifty eight years I've been running Berkshire, we've run into all kinds of problems, but that's what business is about and we run o business so that we don't depend on anything being hunky dory always! We run it so that we will be the last man standing. And that's the way millions of people are going to give me their money and tell me to take care of it. We're going to try and take care of it. And if we don't make as much money, as if we might have if we'd leveraged more or done other policies so be it!With these details in mind, let's take a look at which of Warren Buffett's stock picks are gaining attention among other billionaire hedge fund managers.

With 76% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of PPL, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for PPL ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About PPL?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.PPL already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see PPL's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in PPL. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 13% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.2% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.4% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 24 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of PPLThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of PPL Corporation. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$11m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 24% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over PPL. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Tractor Supply's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. View our latest analysis for Tractor Supply How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Tractor Supply is:57% = US$1.1b ÷ US$1.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.57 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Tractor Supply's Earnings Growth And 57% ROETo begin with, Tractor Supply has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 19% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. This likely paved the way for the modest 19% net income growth seen by Tractor Supply over the past five years. growthStory continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Tractor Supply's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 27% in the same period, which is not something we like to see.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is Tractor Supply fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.Is Tractor Supply Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?In Tractor Supply's case, its respectable earnings growth can probably be explained by its low three-year median payout ratio of 25% (or a retention ratio of 75%), which suggests that the company is investing most of its profits to grow its business.Besides, Tractor Supply has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Looking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 39% over the next three years. However, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much despite the higher expected payout ratio.ConclusionOn the whole, we feel that Tractor Supply's performance has been quite good. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. As a result, the decent growth in its earnings is not surprising. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

140,e1a3d70b-ddd9-331d-a0c7-5a6cabfc26d2,OXY,2023-06-05,INSIGHT-Energy sector's COVID recovery turns into massive CEO payday,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insight-energy-sectors-covid-recovery-100000953.html,1685959200,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'XOM', 'OXY', 'EQT', 'MPC']","[By Tim McLaughlinJune 5 (Reuters) - The CEOs of America’s biggest oil companies were paid a lot more in the first year of the COVID crisis than initially estimated, thanks to stock-heavy compensation packages that have since soared in value, according to an examination of pay disclosures over three years.The pandemic, with lockdowns the norm, resulted in a steep decline in oil and gas consumption and the loss of one in six jobs in the industry. Even so, a Reuters analysis of stock-based pay granted to CEOs at 20 U.S. oil and gas companies in 2020 more than doubled by 2023 when shares vested. That steep increase highlights a system that can richly reward executives amid mass layoffs, refinery closures and slashed capital spending.The analysis of filings by companies in the S&amp;P 500 Energy Sector Index shows stock-based CEO pay is now worth nearly $500 million, up sharply from initial estimates of $187 million.Investors, shareholder advocates and professors who study CEO pay say the eye-popping returns on COVID-era compensation reflect the problems of stock-heavy pay for energy CEOs, chiefly that it often links pay too closely to external factors including oil and gas price swings instead of to long-term financial performance.“Compensation committees need to do a better job of rewarding executives for true out-performance and not just necessarily where the commodity price is,” Aeisha Mastagni, a portfolio manager at the $307 billion California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS), said in response to the Reuters analysis.Public pensions and popular index mutual funds have endured lagging performance in the U.S. energy sector for a decade. The S&amp;P 500 Energy Sector Index’s total return has been 38% since May 2013, far behind the broader S&amp;P 500’s total return of 206%.The pay jump also comes after COVID-era damage across the oil industry, which saw huge spending cuts and widespread job losses. Several hundred employees at a Marathon Petroleum refinery in California, for example, were forced to find new jobs for much less pay, said Virginia Parks, a University of California Irvine professor who studied the plight of the laid off workers.Story continuesMarathon declined to comment about the job cuts.Meanwhile, the executives' compensation surge distorts the CEO pay ratios that companies are required to disclose to investors to demonstrate executive pay is reasonable compared to other employees. One example: Occidental Petroleum Corp said in 2020 that CEO compensation was 104 times higher than median employee pay, but Reuters reporting shows it was in fact 230 times higher after stock gains over the past three years.Occidental said its CEO pay ratio follows the rules laid out by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Christina Noel, a spokesperson for the American Petroleum Institute, noted the energy industry’s CEO pay ratio is the second lowest among 11 industry sectors featuring S&amp;P 500 companies.IT'S RELATIVE WHEN IT COMES TO RETURNSTo be sure, the value of stock-based pay shrinks when markets sour. But most energy CEOs also have a measure of built-in protection from steep declines. CEOs can receive 100% or more of the payout on stock grants tied to total shareholder return even if investors lose money.That’s because about 90% of energy companies measure stock performance against others in the same industry who tend to suffer at similar times. They use a metric called relative total shareholder return (TSR) and benchmark it against a pre-determined group of peer companies - making it possible for executives to get big payouts even if their companies’ stocks lose value.Some CEOs are also paid dividends on unvested restricted stock they technically don't own yet. At ExxonMobil, CEO Darren Woods receives several million dollars a year in cash dividends on unvested restricted stock, according to the oil giant’s pay disclosures.And since becoming CEO in 2017, the number of shares underlying Woods' annual restricted stock grant has grown 70% to 225,000, bolstering his dividend payout, company filings show.Paying dividends on unvested stock grants is opposed by top proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services. Many large companies, including Coca-Cola and Microsoft, have disavowed the practice.Exxon declined to comment on why it pays dividends on unvested stock, but it takes 10 years for each annual grant of restricted stock at Exxon to fully vest.“We believe this unique, long-term approach aligns our executives’ decisions and interests with those of our long-term shareholders,” Exxon said in an email.The $242 billion New York State Common Retirement Fund, which owned several billion dollars worth of oil and gas stocks at the end of March, agreed the 3-year vesting period that’s common in the energy sector is too short.PAY METRICS 'TOO EASY?'Some CEOs profited when the timing of their stock grants coincided with sharp declines in their companies’ share price, giving them more room to benefit from a rebound.Marathon Petroleum’s Michael Hennigan received $9.6 million in stock-based pay, most of it granted on March 17, 2020, the day he became CEO. The grant coincided with one of the lowest closing stock prices in the company’s history as a publicly traded company, according to Refinitiv data.Hennigan’s 2020 stock-based pay fully vested this March with a value of about $45 million, or nearly 5 times the company’s initial estimate. Marathon Petroleum’s total return has been a sector leader, rising nearly 500% under Hennigan.“If a CEO’s stock-based pay more than doubles from the initial estimate, it is excessive,” said Rosanna Landis Weaver, director of wage justice and executive pay at As You Sow, a shareholder advocacy group that reviewed the Reuters reporting. “It tells me that the metrics they are using to base the awards of stock on are too easy.”Some energy CEOs, also benefited from a good performance compared to peers that boosted the overall volume of restricted shares granted, according to proxy statements filed with the SEC.EQT Corp CEO Toby Rice, for example, ultimately received nearly 1.1 million performance shares as part of his 2020 grant, 32% more than the target amount estimated by the company because EQT’s stock outperformed peers and the company’s cash flow satisfied vesting conditions, EQT said in its latest proxy statement. That lifted his overall stock-based pay to about $65 million.The company did not return messages seeking comment.Many energy companies are under pressure from investors to reform CEO pay, according to disclosures in their annual proxy statements. Phillips 66, for example, like many of its peers, now details their compensation discussions with investors to show they’re responsive to their concerns and making changes.The company also capped stock awards linked to total shareholder return if investors lose money after investors complained.“...Recent changes to executive compensation reflect investor feedback,” Phillips 66 told Reuters in an email.Mastagni at CalSTRS, however, said reforms on payouts linked to negative shareholder returns still do not go far enough.“Why should we be paying anything out of shareholder coffers if you lost us money?” Mastagni asked.

One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Vertex Pharmaceuticals Is Vertex Pharmaceuticals Fairly Valued?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.41bUS$3.92bUS$4.39bUS$4.84bUS$5.34bUS$5.72bUS$6.03bUS$6.30bUS$6.54bUS$6.76bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x8Analyst x7Analyst x7Analyst x7Est @ 7.00%Est @ 5.53%Est @ 4.51%Est @ 3.79%Est @ 3.28% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% US$3.2kUS$3.4kUS$3.6kUS$3.7kUS$3.8kUS$3.8kUS$3.8kUS$3.7kUS$3.6kUS$3.5k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$36bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.8b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.1%) = US$145bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$145b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$75bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$111b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$334, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 23% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Vertex Pharmaceuticals as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Vertex PharmaceuticalsStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Currently debt free.WeaknessNo major weaknesses identified for VRTX.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

If you want to see the top ones, skip the detailed analysis and head straight to the 5 Countries With The Highest Soda Consumption.The thirst for soda, transcending geographical borders and cultural differences, knows no bounds. As one of the most widely consumed beverages globally, soda has become ubiquitous in modern lifestyles. From its effervescent bubbles to a seemingly endless array of flavors, soda has captivated the palates of millions. Yet, while soda consumption can be found worldwide, certain countries have insatiable cravings for this sugary indulgence. For example, Coca-Cola is the most consumed soft drink in almost every country, but its consumption is the highest in Mexico, Brazil, and the United States, according to the data collected by Gitnux.  According to Time Magazine, soft drinks alone contribute to a massive expenditure of $65 billion in the United States, with the average American household annually spending an estimated $850 on these carbonated beverages. Examining the Global Market for Carbonated Beverages  The global market for carbonated beverages is highly competitive, with major players such as The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and Dr. Pepper Snapple Group dominating the market. The global carbonated drinks market is projected to reach $320.1 billion by 2028, growing at a CAGR of 4.7% from 2021 to 2028.  The demand for carbonated beverages is driven by various factors such as taste, convenience, and marketing. However, the industry faces challenges due to increasing health concerns among consumers and the rise of alternative beverage options. As a result, companies are introducing new products with lower sugar content and investing in marketing campaigns that promote healthier lifestyles. Despite these challenges, the global market for carbonated beverages is expected to continue growing in the coming years. Story continuesInvestment Opportunities in High-Soda-Consuming Markets Investment opportunities in high-soda-consuming markets are worth considering, as the industry is experiencing steady growth. If you're interested in investing in soda companies themselves, it's essential to conduct a thorough analysis of the financials and market position of each company. For example, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), one of the largest soda companies in the world, had a revenue of $43 billion in 2022, with a net income of $9.5 billion. Similarly, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), another major player in the soda industry, had a revenue of $86.39 billion in the same year, with a net income of $8.91 billion.  Investing in companies producing soda-making equipment and supplies is another option. For example, SodaStream, a company that produces at-home soda-making machines, has experienced steady growth in recent years. In 2017, the company reported a revenue of $543.37 million.  Finally, investing in companies that produce healthier alternatives to soda may also be a wise choice. For example, LaCroix, a famous sparkling water brand, has seen significant growth recently, with a revenue of $563.45 million in 2021 (€500m). Similarly, companies that produce natural fruit juice brands, such as Naked Juice and Odwalla, may also be well-positioned for growth as consumers become more health-conscious. 20 Countries With The Highest Soda ConsumptionPixabay/Public DomainOur Methodology  Our methodology for ranking the countries with the highest soda consumption per capita involved collecting data from reliable sources such as Trade Exports, and 2021 Ahfes Project report, among others.

Three-quarters of Russians purchased Coca-Cola's carbonated soft drinks and lemonades in 2020, while Rich Juice, owned by Coca-Cola HBC, was a favored juice brand. Major soda companies leaving Russia created a vacuum for local players to fill up.Russia's soft drink segment is projected to reach US$2.41 billion in revenue in 2023, with an expected annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.37% from 2023-2027.

The soft drinks market in Saudi Arabia is projected to generate revenue of US$6.75 billion in 2023, with an expected annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.04% from 2023-2027, reflecting the strong demand and positive outlook for the industry in the Saudi Arabian market. 10.

Germany  Soda Consumption Per Capita (2022): 120 liters Germany has seen a significant increase in soda consumption, with a per capita intake of 120 liters annually. The popularity of caffeine-oriented drinks drives the market and features brands like Fanta, Sprite, Delta, Mezzo Mix, and Coca-Cola. However, Germany's soft drink industry's future is still being determined due to government efforts to address health concerns and an aging population. Coca-Cola is the dominant brand nationwide, except in Thuringia, where Vita-Cola holds the top position.

For more Warren Buffett stocks, head on over to 5 Warren Buffett Stocks Other Billionaires Are Loading Up On. Within a couple of years, investing in the stock market has become quite tricky. As the coronavirus pandemic hit the world in full force and lockdowns were imposed, investors lost billions of dollars on the market as economic sentiment was sapped. However, within a year, the market recovered and technology stocks boomed as work from home mandates changed the dynamics behind the demand for consumer products.Then, just as investors were taking a sigh of relief, the historic inflationary cycle and the Russian invasion of Ukraine jostled the world once again in 2022. This effectively divided the market into two halves. One of these was the high growth technology stocks that bled large portions of their value. The other was commodities and energy companies that saw remarkable highs. For the prudent investor, playing the macroeconomic environment would have led to significant gains even as countless others lamented their losses and licked their wounds.This year, all anyone can talk about is a recession. The Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hiking cycle that kicked off last year is designed to slow down the economy to cut down wages and reduce spending power to bring down prices. A consequence of this is a significant economic slowdown that can lead to a prolonged drop in growth which can in certain scenarios be described as recessionary.So, what does one do to invest during these times? Well, one approach is to take a look at what the professionals are doing. And the professional of professionals is none other than the Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway. Berkshire is one of the largest investment holding companies in America, and Mr. Buffett has seen his firm's share price grow by thousands of percentage points over the past couple of decades. A class A share of Berkshire, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), is the most expensive share on the stock market with one share being worth a stunning $492,000 as of June 2023. This same share was worth $985 in 1983, Accounting for inflation, $985 in 1983 would be worth $3,000 today, so it's safe to say that Mr. Buffett's firm has done a lot of things right over these past few decades.Story continuesOver the past couple of months. Mr. Buffett has shared his take on the economy several times. During an interview with CNBC a month back, he provided insights into which businesses might do well and those that were struggling. Some of his favorites, as usual, were in the insurance industry. The legendary investor's remarks were as follows:Well I know what a lot of different businesses is doing, and I just got a report from one of them that happens to be in the retail end of this. It was minus 22% in February from the year ago. In sales, profits are down a lot more than that. On the other hand, some of our businesses are doing fine, but they all are reporting that, some of them are living off of orders that were placed months earlier and that sort of thing. But, it's a tougher world out there in a great many businesses. Not in the insurance business. Insurance business should be better this year than last year. That doesn't mean it will be, because we can't predict everything that happens, but on a probability basis, it should be better than last year. And the railroad business is down, and [inaudible]. But it isn't dramatic, and of course we got the utility business, and that doesn't read very much with things. But, overall, I think people that run our business, that do have any sensitivity to the economy are surprised where they are now compared to where they felt they would be six months ago. But that doesn't mean the world is coming to an end or anything. Fifty eight years I've been running Berkshire, we've run into all kinds of problems, but that's what business is about and we run o business so that we don't depend on anything being hunky dory always! We run it so that we will be the last man standing. And that's the way millions of people are going to give me their money and tell me to take care of it. We're going to try and take care of it. And if we don't make as much money, as if we might have if we'd leveraged more or done other policies so be it!With these details in mind, let's take a look at which of Warren Buffett's stock picks are gaining attention among other billionaire hedge fund managers.

For more Warren Buffett stocks, head on over to 5 Warren Buffett Stocks Other Billionaires Are Loading Up On. Within a couple of years, investing in the stock market has become quite tricky. As the coronavirus pandemic hit the world in full force and lockdowns were imposed, investors lost billions of dollars on the market as economic sentiment was sapped. However, within a year, the market recovered and technology stocks boomed as work from home mandates changed the dynamics behind the demand for consumer products.Then, just as investors were taking a sigh of relief, the historic inflationary cycle and the Russian invasion of Ukraine jostled the world once again in 2022. This effectively divided the market into two halves. One of these was the high growth technology stocks that bled large portions of their value. The other was commodities and energy companies that saw remarkable highs. For the prudent investor, playing the macroeconomic environment would have led to significant gains even as countless others lamented their losses and licked their wounds.This year, all anyone can talk about is a recession. The Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hiking cycle that kicked off last year is designed to slow down the economy to cut down wages and reduce spending power to bring down prices. A consequence of this is a significant economic slowdown that can lead to a prolonged drop in growth which can in certain scenarios be described as recessionary.So, what does one do to invest during these times? Well, one approach is to take a look at what the professionals are doing. And the professional of professionals is none other than the Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway. Berkshire is one of the largest investment holding companies in America, and Mr. Buffett has seen his firm's share price grow by thousands of percentage points over the past couple of decades. A class A share of Berkshire, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), is the most expensive share on the stock market with one share being worth a stunning $492,000 as of June 2023. This same share was worth $985 in 1983, Accounting for inflation, $985 in 1983 would be worth $3,000 today, so it's safe to say that Mr. Buffett's firm has done a lot of things right over these past few decades.Story continuesOver the past couple of months. Mr. Buffett has shared his take on the economy several times. During an interview with CNBC a month back, he provided insights into which businesses might do well and those that were struggling. Some of his favorites, as usual, were in the insurance industry. The legendary investor's remarks were as follows:Well I know what a lot of different businesses is doing, and I just got a report from one of them that happens to be in the retail end of this. It was minus 22% in February from the year ago. In sales, profits are down a lot more than that. On the other hand, some of our businesses are doing fine, but they all are reporting that, some of them are living off of orders that were placed months earlier and that sort of thing. But, it's a tougher world out there in a great many businesses. Not in the insurance business. Insurance business should be better this year than last year. That doesn't mean it will be, because we can't predict everything that happens, but on a probability basis, it should be better than last year. And the railroad business is down, and [inaudible]. But it isn't dramatic, and of course we got the utility business, and that doesn't read very much with things. But, overall, I think people that run our business, that do have any sensitivity to the economy are surprised where they are now compared to where they felt they would be six months ago. But that doesn't mean the world is coming to an end or anything. Fifty eight years I've been running Berkshire, we've run into all kinds of problems, but that's what business is about and we run o business so that we don't depend on anything being hunky dory always! We run it so that we will be the last man standing. And that's the way millions of people are going to give me their money and tell me to take care of it. We're going to try and take care of it. And if we don't make as much money, as if we might have if we'd leveraged more or done other policies so be it!With these details in mind, let's take a look at which of Warren Buffett's stock picks are gaining attention among other billionaire hedge fund managers. Some top stocks on the list are Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO).10 Warren Buffett Stocks Other Billionaires Are Loading Up OnOur Methodology To compile our list of which Warren Buffett stocks are popular with billionaires, we first looked at Berkshire Hathaway's first quarter of 2023 portfolio and selected the top fifteen stocks.

Fundamentally, companies that enjoy a long track record of success (and facilitating passive income) stand a better chance of weathering the storm. In addition, those companies that reward their shareholders with regular income are more able to mitigate downside. After all, those payouts must come from somewhere. So, a business that’s able to provide passive income usually aligns with a relevant industry. Therefore, you usually don’t go wrong with the best long-term dividend stocks.To be sure, nothing in the market or life offers guarantees. However, if you’re worried about both current events and things that haven’t happened yet, these are the dividend stocks for generational wealth that should serve your family (and your descendants) well.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsArcher Daniels Midland (ADM)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comA multinational food processing and commodities trading firm, Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) almost provides a no-brainer for top dividend stocks for future generations. Basically, the company guarantees itself permanent relevance because of its core business. I’ve said this before but no matter how advanced we become as a society, we humans will require basic goods. Obviously, food’s one of them.Specifically for best long-term dividend stocks, I like ADM even better. According to Dividend.com, Archer Daniels carries a forward yield of 2.47%. Although it’s not the most generous source of passive income, it does beat the consumer staple sector’s average yield of 1.89%. Also, its payout ratio sits at just under 27%, which translates to strong confidence in yield sustainability.Another factor that will likely prevent management from messing with the passive income is its 51 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. You don’t want to be the executive that lost Archer Daniels its status as a dividend king. Thus, it’s an easy choice for dividend stocks for generational wealth.Story continuesColgate-Palmolive (CL)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large text.Source: iQoncept/shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Midtown Manhattan, Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) is one of the world’s top consumer product companies. Fundamentally, Colgate offers a similar magnitude of relevance to Archer Daniels. No matter what happens in the future, we’ll need to take care of our teeth. Given the company’s importance to everyday basic care, CL is another no-brainer for top dividend stocks for future generations.To be sure, Colgate itself symbolizes a boring company in a boring industry. However, that’s part of CL’s charm, especially under present circumstances. Right now, the company carries a forward yield of 2.52%, again above the average yield of the consumer staples sector. Colgate’s payout ratio is significant higher than ADM’s at just under 56%. Nevertheless, that’s a reasonable ratio all things considered. Just as well, CL features 61 years of consecutive dividend increases. Again, you don’t want to be the person responsible for removal of dividend king status. Thus, it’s a dependable idea for dividend-paying stocks for family legacy.Sempra (SRE)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockOn a financial and political level, many investors might argue that utility giant Sempra (NYSE:SRE) does not belong on this list of top dividend stocks for future generations. First, Sempra doesn’t enjoy brilliant “paper” stats. For example, its Altman Z-Score – which is a predictor of bankruptcy – sits at 1.07, representing a distressed enterprise. On the political side, many folks have decided to leave California, of which Sempra dominates the southern region. Therefore, consistently unfavorable migration trends, SRE doesn’t seem a wise investment for best long-term dividend stocks.However, utility firms generally don’t have sterling financials. Instead, they command natural monopolies. As for the politics, listen – California being a coastal state to the critical Pacific ocean, it will always be relevant. Always, always, always – take it to the bank if you want. Finally, Sempra carries a forward yield of 3.31%. While it’s a bit lower than the utility sector’s average yield of 3.75%, its payout ratio is reasonable at 49.73%. As well, it enjoys 19 years of consecutive dividend increases.Microsoft (MSFT)Source: ShutterstockTo be fair, most investors probably don’t pick up shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to make it rich. Rather, the technology stalwart provides a reliable canvas for capital gains and a modest amount of passive income. However, as an idea for top dividend stocks for future generations, MSFT holds its own. It’s not sexy but I’m almost certain it will be around for the next 100 years.Fundamentally, Microsoft Windows continues to hold a dominant position regarding desktop operating system market share. To be fair, this metric slipped sharply since the end of last year but it remains impressive at 62.65%. Also, Microsoft has its hands in myriad other platforms and innovations so it’s not going anywhere.In terms of passive income, MSFT might seem like a joke based on its forward yield of 0.82%. However, the company also enjoys 20 years of consecutive dividend increases. As well, its payout ratio sits at 24.68%, offering maximum confidence regarding yield sustainability. Plus, Microsoft continues to be a growth machine. Per Gurufocus, its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 17.4%, above 71.21% of the competition.IBM (IBM)sheet of paper marked ""dividends"" with a $20 bill on top of it to represent dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockOne of the biggest names in the tech ecosystem, IBM (NYSE:IBM) also features a rich history, founded in 1911. For full disclosure, IBM ranks among the more volatile entities in recent sessions. Since the beginning of this year, shares of “Big Blue” fell nearly 9%. In the trailing year, they’re down more than 7%. Still, IBM may qualify as one of the top dividend stocks for future generations.For quite some time, IBM fell under pressure because of its exposure to legacy business units that progressively became less relevant. However, in recent years, its evolving management team aggressively pushed into pertinent arenas, such as hybrid cloud. Also, it’s a powerhouse in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Over the next decades, IBM should really be a dominant player.While you’re waiting for this narrative to pan out, IBM also ranks as one of the high-yield stocks for grandchildren. Sure, there are companies that offer higher rates of passive income but IBM’s forward yield of 5.15% is contextually reliable. Business-wise, it continues to expand into relevant sectors. Also, it features 30 years of consecutive payout increases, making it one of the popular dividend aristocrats.Iron Mountain (IRM)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockAn enterprise information management service, Iron Mountain (NYSE:IRM) focuses on multiple critical needs. These include records management, information destruction and data backup and recovery services. According to its public profile, as of 2020, over 94% of Fortune 1000 companies used Iron Mountain’s services to store and manage their information in some capacity.Moving forward, I see IRM’s relevance only rising, making it one of the top dividend stocks for future generations. Sure, the company’s digital protection services will undoubtedly thrive as more of our data hits the cloud. However, the biggest companies and the most critical organizations will hit up Iron Mountain for physical document and equipment storage.Basically, stuff happens. Plus, the smartest hacker in the world wouldn’t be able to crack paper documents. Almost as a bonus, IRM also ranks among the high-yield stocks for grandchildren. Currently, Iron Mountain carries a forward yield of 4.62%. However, sustainability might be an issue because of its sky-high payout ratio. Still, the long-term relevancy is a strong selling point.Chevron (CVX)dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockOn surface level, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) might seem the most controversial name on this list of dividend stocks for generational wealth. After all, go-green advocates have repeatedly stated that electric vehicles are the future. And they very well might be but probably for rich people. You have to at least consider the possibility that hydrocarbons may be around for a very long time.First, you must consider the science. Like it or not, hydrocarbons command high energy density. In fairness, scientists continue to conduct intense research and development to improve the energy density of EV batteries, among other key attributes. However, such tech costs plenty of money – money that regular folks even at scale might not be able to afford.In addition, as relatively new tech, EVs will likely foster social inequities. Basically, the rich will be able to afford fast-charging EVs that deliver 600 miles of total range while everyone else may be left with electric clunkers. For this and many other reasons, Chevron should still be relevant a century from now. Plus, its 3.92% forward yield makes it one of the best long-term dividend stocks.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Billionaires Are Crazy About These 5 Stocks. Investors seem to have ignored all the panic around debt ceiling and are instead salivating over the possibility that the Federal Reserve might stop increasing interest rates. If the US government successfully raises the debt ceiling and avoids default, the stock market could continue its positive trajectory for a while longer. On May 3, the Federal Reserve increased interest rates for the 10th consecutive time. However, the Fed indicated that these hikes may have reached their conclusion, partly due to concerns within the banking system. According to Jerome Powell, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, a reduction in bank lending would impede an economy that the central bank was already trying to regulate as part of a larger effort to control and alleviate high inflation.Despite lingering worries about a potential recession in the later part of 2023, which have persisted for around 10 to 11 months, there is currently a sense of investor optimism. This is driven by satisfactory earnings in the first quarter and the possibility of the Federal Reserve temporarily halting interest rate hikes, which sets the stage for a strong market in June. The U.S. economy is also showcasing remarkable strength, as indicated by key factors like GDP and employment. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, there was a rise of 339,000 in total nonfarm payroll employment in May. However, the unemployment rate also increased by 0.3 percentage points to reach 3.7%. The sectors that experienced job gains included professional and business services, government, health care, construction, transportation and warehousing, and social assistance. Furthermore, the recent solid performance of financial, industrial, and material sectors disproves the notion of an impending economic slowdown, as these cyclical stocks normally drop in value before an economic downturn.Story continuesDon't Miss: 10 Chinese Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up OnMorningstar's valuations suggest that investors can benefit from a portfolio that combines both value and growth investments, while reducing exposure to core investments. Both the value and growth categories are considered undervalued, although the growth category has become relatively less undervalued compared to the start of the year due to its strong performance so far. On the other hand, the core category is less appealing in comparison to the overall market average as it is closer to fair value. In terms of market capitalization, the valuations of large-cap stocks have slightly surpassed the market average due to their strong performance in the first quarter. On the other hand, mid-cap stocks are slightly below the overall market average in terms of valuations. However, small-cap stocks are notably undervalued, as they are currently trading at a significant 33% discount, as per Morningstar’s report. Amid the stock market swings, billionaire investors exhibit a strong affinity towards lucrative investment opportunities in the realm of high-quality stocks. As per Insider Monkey’s data, some of the top stocks favored by billionaires during Q1 2023 included Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc.

Gross Bookings grew 19% year over year to $31 billion, driven by 31% Mobility Gross Bookings growth and 6% Delivery Growth Bookings growth. 4Q Adjusted EBITDA of $665 million, up $579 million year over year, significantly beating management’s $600-$630 million guidance. Management guided to continuing growth in 1Q for Gross Bookings (20%- 24% growth) and Adjusted EBITDA (of $660-$700 million).UBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with a greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates. Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now solidly profitable with the potential for substantial margin expansion and free cash flow generation to come. We view UBER as more than just ride sharing and food delivery, but also as a global mobility platform with the ability to sell to its 131 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as package and grocery delivery, travel, truck brokerage (the company had $1.5 billion in Freight revenue for 4Q22), and worker staffing for shift work. Given its $4 billion of unrestricted cash and $5 billion of investments, the company today has an enterprise value of $70 billion, indicating that UBER trades at 1.6x next year’s estimated revenue.”9.

The company is leading in most secular growth categories in computing, and especially artificial intelligence and super-computing parallel processing techniques for solving complex computational problems. Simply put. Nvidia’s computational power is a critical enabler of Al and therefore critical to Al adoption, in our view. As such, we believe Nvidia is a long-term high unit volume growth opportunity. During the period, NVIDIA reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that met expectations, as the company navigated. through an inventory correction associated with the broad macroeconomic slowdown. Moreover, management gave fiscal year earnings guidance that was better than analyst estimates. noting strong year-over-year growth in gaming and data centers.

Additionally, the net revenue for the quarter amounted to $7.99 billion, compared to the consensus estimate of $7.79 billion. The company's results for the fiscal Q2 exceeded expectations in terms of both revenue and earnings, exhibiting growth compared to the same period in the previous year.

(NYSE:V) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“We trimmed Mastercard and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) to equal weights of the Portfolio. Mastercard and Visa operate as a duopoly in a large and growing market. Over the last 50 years, global personal consumer expenditures (PCE) has grown 7-9% annualized. We expect 4-5% long-term PCE growth going forward. Additionally, the shift from cash to credit continues unabated, with a total credit penetration of only approximately 50% globally.3 This shift provides Visa and Mastercard with another ~4-6% of growth. When combined with PCE, this gives both companies high-single-digit to low-double[1]digit revenue growth opportunities. This growth estimate is before accounting for growth amplifiers like the acceleration of e[1]commerce, the shift from offline to online, and additional services. Both companies enjoy extremely strong network effects that provide strong competitive advantages.We have trimmed Visa and Mastercard because their combined weight grew to over 12% of the Global Growth Portfolio because of their recent performance and to fund our increase in Amazon’s position size. We added to both positions when their prices were depressed due to cross-border transactions deteriorating materially from the pandemic. Cross-border volumes came roaring back when travel corridors reopened, and although we are several quarters removed from the cross-border nadir, Visa still grew volumes &gt;30% in 1Q23. Total cross-border volumes are now 132% of 2019 levels. At 4.5% each, both companies remain high conviction positions for Global Growth.”7.

On May 18, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPADS of $1.56, beating market estimates by $0.21. The revenue of $30.32 billion topped Wall Street consensus by $410 million. After Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) reported its March quarter results and expressed positive expectations for user and order growth in the June quarter, BofA analyst Joyce Ju reaffirmed a Buy rating on the stock on May 19. However, the analyst lowered the firm's price target on the shares from $144 to $132.

The company remains a high-quality business with leading positions in both eCommerce and Public Cloud. We exited our position in January at around US$116 per share with the shares having rallied more than 90% since their early November lows and our China re-opening catalyst having played out. We subsequently re-entered the position in March with the shares having pulled back and with the company announcing a new organizational and governance structure. Alibaba has announced plans to split into six major business groups – Cloud Intelligence, Taobao Tmall, Local Services, Global Digital, Cainiao Smart Logistics and Digital Media and Entertainment Group. Each of these groups will be managed independently (separate CEO and board) and have the flexibility to raise external capital and potentially pursue separate IPOs. We believe this announcement is a strong catalyst to unlock the inherent sum-of-the-parts valuation discount in the company.”6. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 116Number of Billionaire Investors: 25UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) operates as a diversified health care company in the United States. In the first quarter of 2023, 25 billionaires held stakes in UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH). On April 14, the company reported a Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $6.26 and a revenue of $91.9 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.18 and $2.12 billion, respectively. On May 25, Piper Sandler analyst Jessica Tassan initiated coverage of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) with an Overweight rating and a $580 price target. Piper Sandler believes that the Optum businesses within UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) will play a crucial role in delivering consistent and exceptional earnings per share growth over the next ten years. The firm asserted that Optum will be the driving force shaping UnitedHealth's trajectory in the coming decade, serving as an increasingly important entry point to the broader enterprise.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 116 hedge funds were bullish on UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), compared to 110 funds in the earlier quarter. Billionaire Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is the biggest stakeholder of the company. Like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is on the radar of billionaire investors. Alger Spectra Fund made the following comment about UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is an integrated healthcare benefits company uniquely positioned to address rising healthcare costs for its customers, due to its vertical integration, size, and scale. The Optum health benefits services unit, which accounts for approximately 45% of the company’s operating earnings, in our view, has the potential to grow even further as customers look for ways to manage rising healthcare costs. During the period, shares detracted from performance due to several factors: 1) many 2022 healthcare winners with shorter duration profiles and persistent earnings profiles, such as UnitedHealth Group. underperformed in the first quarter of 2023, 2) uncertainty surrounding Medicare Advantage reimbursement levels from the Federal government in 2023, which will be determined later in the year, and 3) increased regulatory scrutiny in the form of potential Medicare Advantage audits across the industry. While these concerns have impacted UnitedHealth in the near-term, we believe company fundamentals remain intact given its large scale business model, competitive advantages, and medium to long- term growth prospects.” Click to continue reading and see Billionaires Are Crazy About These 5 Stocks.  Suggested articles:15 Best Healthcare Stocks To Buy Now20 Poorest Countries in Europe16 Best Retirement Communities in Florida Near the Beach Disclosure: None.

Vanguard’s Health Care ETF (NYSEARCA:VHT) is down 5% on the year, compared with a 10% year-to-date gain in the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index. Investors should view the current slump as an opportunity to take positions in leading healthcare stocks with growth potential.The current dip in healthcare stocks is largely due to investors pulling back after the pandemic when many companies saw their share prices more than double as the quest for a Covid-19 vaccine was front-and-center. However, many analysts view healthcare stocks as good bets during an economic downturn as the essential nature of medical care makes the companies and their shares recession-proof. Here are three of the most promising healthcare stocks for June 2023.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPfizer (PFE)Pfizer logo on Pfizer building. Pfizer is an American pharmaceutical corporation.Source: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.comPfizer (NYSE:PFE) is, of course, the leading pharmaceutical company behind many blockbuster medications. It was also one of the first to bring a Covid-19 vaccine to market. In 2022, the company sold $37.8 billion worth of its Covid-19 vaccine around the world. Pfizer also got good news recently when its Covid-19 antiviral pill was granted full approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.Yet despite all the positives, PFE stock has declined 30% over the last 12 months, including a pullback of 26% this year. Through five years, Pfizer’s share price is up a modest 10%. The decline over the last year has been due to concerns about waning sales of its Covid-19 vaccine now that the pandemic has ended. After racking up record annual sales of $100 billion in 2022, investors and analysts appear worried that the good times are over for the company.But Pfizer has other bestselling drugs on the market and a strong pipeline of new products in development. PFE stock also pays a generous dividend that yields 4.36%.UnitedHealth Group (UNH)The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comStory continuesUnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) has the distinction of being the largest healthcare company by revenue and the largest insurance company by net premiums in the entire world. This makes UNH stock a safe bet for investors as businesses and individuals prioritize paying their health insurance premiums in good economic times and bad. This helps to explain how UnitedHealth has grown to become one of the world’s largest companies.UNH stock has proven to be a long-term winner for investors with its share price having doubled in the past five years. Investors looking for opportunities to buy a quality stock on the dip can get UnitedHealth Group on the cheap right now with the company’s share price down 7% on the year and a decent price-earnings ratio of 22. UNH stock has slumped with the broader healthcare sector, but the decline is not likely to last long.McKesson (MCK)McKesson headquarters in Irving, TXSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comMcKesson (NYSE:MCK) is another on the list of best healthcare companies to invest in. MCK stock has also been caught in the healthcare slump, though it appears that it has bottomed and is beginning to recover. It has gained 2% in the past six months. Over the last five years, the company’s share price has risen an impressive 173%. For those unfamiliar with McKesson, the company employs an army of 80,000 workers who collectively distribute nearly a third of all pharmaceuticals used in North America. Its service is considered essential by hospitals and medical clinics.McKesson’s business continues to steadily grow. In the last two decades, MCK has increased its annual revenue by an average of 8.9% a year. That growth looks set to continue as the company raised its guidance for this year, citing increasing demand for distribution of medical devices and pharmaceutical medications.

Research verified by independent parties to establish the environmental impact of Fairy’s hand and dishwasher products across their lifecycle.Results found the majority of the carbon footprint of dishwashing - both by hand and in a machine - is related to heating of the water and additional energy needed to run an automatic dishwasher cycle in the consumer’s kitchen. On average, these processes can cause up to 93% of hand dishwashing’s carbon footprint and 72% of the carbon footprint when using a machine**.Story continuesIn line with these findings, Fairy encourages consumers to wash cooler and switch from normal to short cycles. The latest Fairy formulas are designed with a Fast Activating Cleaning System for faster action in short cycles and to work quickly even in cooler water temperatures at the sink. Hence, cutting the carbon footprint of dishwashing by reducing the energy used to heat water. With Fairy specially designed to offer a brilliant clean even in these more challenging cleaning conditions, these campaigns set to demonstrate the sustained cleaning power of Fairy to inspire a switch to more sustainable dishwashing habits that can also help users save.Oya Ongor, Senior Vice President, Procter &amp; Gamble Home Care brands, Europe, comments: ""As staple products in homes across Europe, we know we have a responsibility to help families. Our research continues to find that families need a product they can trust - if it doesn’t work in sustainable conditions, they’ll stick to the behaviors they know will get the job done, and they’ve too often been let down by poor performance. That’s why we design products that are made to help consumer save energy, with products delivering impeccable cleaning results in challenging energy efficient conditions.Our sustainability journey doesn’t stop there, of course.

That pressure poses the risk of leading to a collapse. Even absent a collapse, a substantial decline in price is highly likely. Interest rates remain high and the Fed has signaled that it may again raise rates further. Work-from-home trends continue to be an issue. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWorkers are dug in and ready to fight against a return to office. That affects these commercial real estate stocks to sell in a tangible way, as much of their business relies on office buildings and physically present workers. Renewed rounds of tech layoffs hasten the stresses on commercial real estate. So, investors should steer clear as the bottom could fall out any day leading to rapid and substantial losses.

The company operates a portfolio of office and retail space primarily in New York City, with other holdings in San Francisco and Chicago.Currently, several signs suggest that Vordano Realty Trust is already on a rapid downward trajectory. In the first three months of 2023, shareholder net income dropped to $5.168 million. A year earlier that figure stood at $26.478 million. That is a signal shareholders should think twice about holding on to VNO shares.  Further, Vordano Realty Trust announced it is postponing dividends on its shares until the end of 2023. The dividend was yielding over 11% and remained one of the prime enticements for potential investors.Story continues Generally speaking, REIT dividends are high because of the risk inherent in the business model. Once suspended, one of the major benefits of investing is gone. Boston Properties (BXP)Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of boston properties, stock market chart background. BXP stock.Source: Ralf Liebhold / ShutterstockBack in 2021, Boston Properties (NYSE:BXP) was featured in a Barron’s article about return-to-office stocks. Vaccinations and cherry-picked stories praising in-office work strengthened the narrative for BXP. A year-and-a-half later, the pendulum has swung back in the other direction and office space operators are facing significant risks.Boston Properties is the largest publicly traded U.S. firm in premier office spaces. It operates spaces in Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. It’s fair to assume that east and west-coast workers are more difficult to force back into office than some of their sun belt counterparts. That’s an important factor in states where workers’ rights are stronger. And it’s a detriment to Boston Properties in this case. Net income fell from $143 million to $77.9 million during the first quarter. The company is leaning heavily into the biotech/life sciences sector by signing leases with companies in that industry. But there is little reason to believe that can make up for the losses overall. Highwoods Properties (HIW)A photo of a person in a neon green vest holding blueprints and standing behind a white table covered with supplies like pencils, a computer, a ruler and two wooden house shapes.Source: ARMMY PICCA/ShutterStock.comHighwoods Properties (NYSE:HIW) rents exclusively within the sun belt. In sun belt states a top-down approach is more common: If employers favor RTO, then it’s much easier to implement. At first blush, that looks to be one factor resulting in stronger operations at Highwoods Properties The numbers substantiate the idea that HIW is a better firm than the two firms immediately above. Revenues increased modestly from $206.4 million to $212.75 million in the first quarter. Net income and income available to stockholders increased as well. But the company terminated more than twice as many leases a year ago during the same quarter. It also raised rents by 15.9% while increasing its footprint by roughly 35%. That larger footprint costs more now as interest rates are higher. Highwood Properties is pushing higher rents onto firms that will struggle in a recession. They may not pay at all, so those higher rents now might look good, but may be a false flag. Kilroy Realty (KRC)A shot of a single family home with a green lawn and trees in the background.Source: ShutterstockThe vast majority of Kilroy Realty’s (NYSE:KRC) portfolio is concentrated in California, with a few of properties in Seattle and Texas. remaining properties, 7 are in Seattle and 2 in Texas. The same argument applies here for KRC stock: Workers in west coast states have a lot more leverage for working from home.Shareholders continue to be skeptical about Kilroy Realty. The company’s fundamentals aren’t getting worse, though. Revenues increased by 10.3% in the first quarter and net income was up 6.7%. Yet share prices continue to slide and have lost more than 30% year-to-date.My guess is that tech fears have something to do with investor reticence around KRC. The company signed a 20,000 sq ft lease at  Indeed Tower during the quarter. Another round of tech layoffs is underway. That will affect Indeed as the labor market continues to soften for white-collar workers.SL Green Realty (SLG)Source: ShutterstockSL Green Realty (NYSE:SLG) stock represents Manhattan’s largest office landlord. The financial center of the U.S. is ground zero for the RTO vs. remote work argument. In late 2022, media reports of workers trickling back to NYC offices abounded. By early 2023 though, New York City Mayor Eric Adams was trying to force major Wall Street firms to mandate office returns. That’s a clear negative sign for SL Green Realty given its position as the largest office landlord. The firm’s revenues increased in the first quarter, up approximately 20%. Yet expenses increased a much faster 50% during the same period and SL Green Realty went from net gains to net losses. Interest expenses nearly tripled. Rental income declined. In short, it became a lot more expensive to be SL Green Realty quickly.  Mayor Adams knows his city depends on the revenues and taxes from office buildings remaining occupied. His bias in pushing for RTO is clear, but it’s not that simple. Hudson Pacific Properties (HPP)Flat cut-out image of house jammed into the crack of dry desert, symbolizing housing crisisSource: shutterstock.com/Roman BodnarchukHudson Pacific Properties (NYSE:HPP) is another of the highly concentrated commercial real estate stocks to sell. The company leases spaces to tech companies and media companies. That leaves it highly concentrated in San Francisco and Los Angeles, the respective epicenters of those sectors. Its fundamentals are flat over the first quarter. The company made about $250 million in sales and lost $20 million. That’s pretty much in line with where it was a year ago. What’s interesting about the company is how heavily it is betting on a resurgent tech sector. Over 80% of new leasing activity during the quarter occurred in San Francisco. The potential problem there is that most of the resurgence in tech in 2023 was in major tech names and AI narratives. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has held up its end of the bargain with a very strong quarter. But will that success trickle down throughout silicon valley and boost the leasees at Hudson Pacific Properties? If it doesn’t then HPP stock could be in for a real shock as those small firms ability to pay rent decreases. Cousins Properties (CUZ)A photo of a man in a mask and neon green vest in front of a home that's under construction.Source: Tong_stocker/ShutterStock.comCousins Properties (NYSE:CUZ) stock provides the antithesis to the notion that Sun Belt REITs are doing better overall.  Net income available to stockholders decreased from $28 million to $22.2 million during the first quarter. Cousins Properties leased property to Silicon Valley Bank in Phoenix. Although the company continues to receive payment on the property, the fact that it is prominently mentioned in the earnings report suggests the risk of default is high. Cousins Properties is in a position in which revenue growth of 8.5% is slower than expenses growth, at 13.1%. That is likely to result when losses continue to grow. The company also has a $62 million loan maturing June 1 for which it took out another loan to pay. In short, Cousins Properties looks to be taking out higher-interest debt to pay lower-interest debt which is a recipe for trouble in the long run. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

If you want to see the top ones, skip the detailed analysis and head straight to the 5 Countries With The Highest Soda Consumption.The thirst for soda, transcending geographical borders and cultural differences, knows no bounds. As one of the most widely consumed beverages globally, soda has become ubiquitous in modern lifestyles. From its effervescent bubbles to a seemingly endless array of flavors, soda has captivated the palates of millions. Yet, while soda consumption can be found worldwide, certain countries have insatiable cravings for this sugary indulgence. For example, Coca-Cola is the most consumed soft drink in almost every country, but its consumption is the highest in Mexico, Brazil, and the United States, according to the data collected by Gitnux.  According to Time Magazine, soft drinks alone contribute to a massive expenditure of $65 billion in the United States, with the average American household annually spending an estimated $850 on these carbonated beverages. Examining the Global Market for Carbonated Beverages  The global market for carbonated beverages is highly competitive, with major players such as The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and Dr. Pepper Snapple Group dominating the market. The global carbonated drinks market is projected to reach $320.1 billion by 2028, growing at a CAGR of 4.7% from 2021 to 2028.  The demand for carbonated beverages is driven by various factors such as taste, convenience, and marketing. However, the industry faces challenges due to increasing health concerns among consumers and the rise of alternative beverage options. As a result, companies are introducing new products with lower sugar content and investing in marketing campaigns that promote healthier lifestyles. Despite these challenges, the global market for carbonated beverages is expected to continue growing in the coming years. Story continuesInvestment Opportunities in High-Soda-Consuming Markets Investment opportunities in high-soda-consuming markets are worth considering, as the industry is experiencing steady growth. If you're interested in investing in soda companies themselves, it's essential to conduct a thorough analysis of the financials and market position of each company. For example, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), one of the largest soda companies in the world, had a revenue of $43 billion in 2022, with a net income of $9.5 billion. Similarly, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), another major player in the soda industry, had a revenue of $86.39 billion in the same year, with a net income of $8.91 billion.  Investing in companies producing soda-making equipment and supplies is another option. For example, SodaStream, a company that produces at-home soda-making machines, has experienced steady growth in recent years. In 2017, the company reported a revenue of $543.37 million.  Finally, investing in companies that produce healthier alternatives to soda may also be a wise choice. For example, LaCroix, a famous sparkling water brand, has seen significant growth recently, with a revenue of $563.45 million in 2021 (€500m). Similarly, companies that produce natural fruit juice brands, such as Naked Juice and Odwalla, may also be well-positioned for growth as consumers become more health-conscious. 20 Countries With The Highest Soda ConsumptionPixabay/Public DomainOur Methodology  Our methodology for ranking the countries with the highest soda consumption per capita involved collecting data from reliable sources such as Trade Exports, and 2021 Ahfes Project report, among others.
