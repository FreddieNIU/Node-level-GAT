A quarter ago, it was expected that this independent ratings and analytics provider would post earnings of $2.47 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.54, delivering a surprise of 2.83%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.S&amp;P Global , which belongs to the Zacks Business - Information Services industry, posted revenues of $3.16 billion for the quarter ended March 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.55%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.39 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.S&amp;P Global shares have added about 1.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 5.6%.What's Next for S&amp;P Global?While S&amp;P Global has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook.

However, the unusually rapid hikes from unprecedented, near-zero interest rates caused mayhem in the regional banking sector – leading to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SIVB). At the root of SVB’s collapse was a large amount of bank deposits in the long-term U.S. treasuries and mortgage-backed securities (assets that typically fall when interest rates rise). As word spread of SVB’s liquidity crisis and investment issues, depositors began to panic, leading to a classic bank run.Though Schwab is not a regional bank, rumors and fears are leading to real world issues for the bank. According to Bloomberg, Schwab is “facing dwindling deposits”. As if that wasn’t enough, Schwab’s costs are rising rapidly and have been doing so for years. In fact, between 2016-2022 expenses rose at a compound annual growth rate of more than 15%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIndustry WoesOur studies show that stocks within the bottom half of the Zacks industry group list tend to underperform dramatically.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance in the past, and go directly to read 5 Best May Dividend Stocks To Buy. Dividend stocks have been a popular investment option for decades, providing investors with a steady stream of income from the dividends paid out by companies. Growth investment outweighed dividend stocks historically, however, the onset of the pandemic of 2020 has made investors risk-averse and led to a renewed interest in dividend companies. Over the years, dividends accounted for between 40% to 50% of total return in the US equity market, with an even larger proportion in international markets.Companies in the S&amp;P 500 paid out a record $561 billion in dividends in 2022, up from $511.2 billion in 2021. Another reason for this tremendous growth was resilient corporate earnings and solid cash flow on corporate balance sheets. The trend is expected to continue this year as well, however, with the recent developments surrounding the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) fallout and the state of the economy, analysts now expect a modest growth in dividend payments in 2023.In the first quarter of 2023, cash dividends within the S&amp;P 500 set a record payment, growing by 0.9% from the previous quarter and by 7.9% from the same period last year, as reported by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. For the 12-month period that ended March 2023, the S&amp;P 500 dividends were up 10.1% from the prior-year period. Some of the best dividend stocks that are gaining investors’ attention include Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX).Dividend stocks also offer a short-term profit opportunity to investors. For this reason, investors often use a dividend capture strategy, which involves buying a stock just before the company pays its dividend and then selling the stock shortly after the dividend is paid.

As Schwab began the year as a 7.0% weight in the portfolio, this hurt as much as the wipeout at First Republic. The declines in First Republic and Schwab together cost us a full five percentage points of our capital. Other financial holdings M&amp;T Bank, Credit Acceptance and JP Morgan also lost value during the quarter.Moving to Schwab, there are some similarities with First Republic, but I feel pretty strongly that we’re going to be fine holding on to the stock.I sometimes describe Schwab as the Costco of financial services. Others liken it to the auto insurer Progressive: it has the lowest operating costs in a huge, commoditized industry. Schwab passes on most of the savings from its low cost structure to clients, creating loyalty and trust, which in turn builds its brand. But Schwab has, over many years, reduced fees in so many areas that today it may be overly dependent on the net interest margin it earns on cash swept into its bank…” (Click here to read the full text)6.

Quarterly adjusted earnings per share of $2.16 handily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.74. However, the bottom line was down from the prior-year quarter’s $3.80.While the decline in net revenues of the Investment Banking &amp; Equities, and Investment Management segments hampered the overall top line, lower expenses alleviated the bottom-line pressure. Amid a challenging operating environment, EVR saw a decline in assets under management (AUM).Net income available to common shareholders (GAAP basis) was $83.4 million, down from $158 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Revenues &amp; Expenses DeclineIn first-quarter 2023, net revenues of $576.3 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $512.6 million. However, the top line decreased 20.7% year over year. A decline in advisory fees, underwriting fees, commissions and related revenues, as well as asset management and administration fees, led to the fall.Total expenses declined 9.4% to $465.2 million. The fall was mainly due to lower employee compensation and benefits costs.The adjusted compensation ratio was 63.5%, up from the prior-year quarter’s 50%.The adjusted operating margin was 20%, down from the prior-year quarter’s 29.5%.Quarterly Segmental Performance (Adjusted)Investment Banking &amp; Equities: Net revenues declined 21% year over year to $577.7 million.

Moreover, current assets exceeded current liabilities by $1.5 billion as of the same date.Story continuesCapital Deployment ActivitiesIn first-quarter 2023, Evercore repurchased 2.2 million shares at an average price of $132.20 per share.Our ViewpointThe company’s financial performance in the first quarter seems disappointing, as revenues declined. Nonetheless, amid the unfavorable macroeconomic backdrop for deal-making, the company’s initiatives to boost its client base in advisory solutions and expand geographically are impressive strategic moves.Also, with strong liquidity, the company’s efforts to enhance shareholders’ value through steady capital deployment activities seem sustainable.Evercore Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Evercore Inc Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseEvercore Inc price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Evercore Inc QuoteCurrently, Evercore has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Peer PerformanceCharles Schwab’s SCHW first-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings of 93 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 90 cents. The bottom line also grew 21% from the prior-year quarter.SCHW’s results benefited from higher rates, which led to a rise in net interest income (NII). Thus, revenues improved despite lower bank deposit fees and higher volatility hurting trading income. Also, the absence of fee waivers and solid brokerage account numbers acted as tailwinds during the quarter. However, higher expenses were undermining factors for SCHW.Interactive Brokers Group’s IBKR first-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $1.35 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.40. However, the bottom line reflects a rise of 64.6% from the prior-year quarter.Interactive Brokers' results were primarily hurt by an increase in expenses. A fall in daily average revenue trades (DARTs) was another headwind. Nevertheless, an improvement in revenues was a tailwind. Also, Interactive Brokers’ capital position was strong.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.The Charles Schwab Corporation currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.79, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 14 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.79 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 14 recommendations that derive the current ABR, eight are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 57.1% and 14.3% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for SCHWBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for SCHWCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for The Charles Schwab Corporation here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying The Charles Schwab Corporation, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Story continuesZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Should You Invest in SCHW?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for The Charles Schwab Corporation, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 16% over the past month to $3.40.Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for The Charles Schwab Corporation.

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 86% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.And so it follows that institutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to US$150b last week after a 6.4% drop in the share price. Needless to say, the recent loss which further adds to the one-year loss to shareholders of 3.3% might not go down well especially with this category of shareholders. Also referred to as ""smart money"", institutions have a lot of sway over how a stock's price moves. As a result, if the decline continues, institutional investors may be pressured to sell Texas Instruments which might hurt individual investors.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Texas Instruments. See our latest analysis for Texas Instruments ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Texas Instruments?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Texas Instruments. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Texas Instruments, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Texas Instruments. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.7% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.5% and 4.1%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.After doing some more digging, we found that the top 22 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Texas InstrumentsThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Texas Instruments Incorporated. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$184m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 14% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For example, we've discovered 3 warning signs for Texas Instruments (1 is concerning!) that you should be aware of before investing here.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

Reported EPS is $4.45, expectations were $3.81.Operator Good afternoon, and welcome to Nucor's First Quarter Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise and today's call is being recorded. After the speakers' prepared remarks, I will provide instructions for callers wishing to ask questions.I would now like to introduce Jack Sullivan, General Manager of Nucor Investor Relations. You may begin your call.Jack Sullivan Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Nucor's first quarter 2023 earnings review and business update. Leading our call today is Leon Topalian, Chair, President and CEO, along with Steve Laxton, Executive Vice President and CFO. We also have other members of Nucor's executive team with us, including Dave Sumoski, Chief Operating Officer; Al Behr, responsible for Plate and Structural Products; Noah Hanners over raw materials; John Hollatz, Bar Products and Fabrication; Doug Jellison, Corporate Strategy; Greg Murphy, Business Services, Sustainability and General Counsel; Dan Needham, Commercial Strategy; Rex Query, Sheet and Tubular Products; and Chad Utermark, New markets and Innovation.This morning, we posted our earnings release and an updated slide deck to the Nucor Investor Relations website.We encourage you to access these materials, and we will cover portions of them during the call. Today's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking information within the meaning of securities laws. Actual results may be different than forward-looking statements and involve risks outlined in our safe harbor statement and disclosed in Nucor's SEC filings. The appendix of today's presentation includes supplemental information and disclosures, along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.So with that, let's turn the call over to Leon.Leon Topalian Thanks, Jack, and welcome, everyone. I'd like to begin by thanking our 31,000 team members for delivering another strong quarter for our shareholders while continuing to deliver on our most important value, the health, safety and well-being of the entire Nucor family.Story continuesWe're coming off our fourth consecutive year setting new safety records and the team is off to a strong start again in 2023, ahead of last year's record performance through the first quarter.Turning to our financial results in the first quarter. Nucor generated EBITDA of approximately $1.9 billion and net earnings of $1.1 billion, or $4.45 per diluted share. This strong performance was due in large part to the ongoing profitability of our steel products segments, along with increased volumes and margins at our steel mills segment compared to Q4. In our steel products segment, net earnings were down 10% from Q4 levels, but remained 42% ahead of the prior year quarter and significantly above historical averages. Shipments out of our steel mills rose 18%, taking utilization to approximately 80% during Q1 compared to 70% in the prior quarter.And finally, the performance of our raw materials segment improved in the first quarter due to higher volumes.Nucor has created significant long-term value over many years and cycles by executing on its strategy. And today, we continue to position the company for further value creation. We are advancing several large capital projects to drive continued earnings growth, market share gains and margin expansion in our core steelmaking businesses. In our sheet mill group, Nucor Steel Gallatin continues to ramp up production. We've invested in Gallatin mill to completely modernize its operations and more than double its capacity, and we're pleased with the progress the team has made to date. During the second quarter, we expect Gallatin will continue ramping up to its full run rate of 2.8 million tons and return to profitability.We remain confident Gallatin will be a strong contributor to Nucor's bottom line in the second half of 2023 and for many years to come.Shifting to West Virginia. Progress continues with our new sheet mill. The team has received all preconstruction state permits and is awaiting final federal permits, which we anticipate being finalized in the next few months. We expect to complete construction approximately two years after the receipt of all permits. And as previously announced, Nucor's Board of Directors approved an updated budget for the West Virginia project, which is now estimated at a net cost of $3.1 billion. Once completed, the new mill will have an annual capacity of 3 million tons per year and advanced capabilities that will enhance our ability to provide customers with high quality, low embodied carbon steel products, particularly for the demanding automotive and construction applications.Turning to our plate operations, the team at Nucor Brandenburg has had a productive quarter focused on continued commissioning of the mill and beginning shipments to customers.Photo by the blowup on UnsplashThroughout Q1, the team has made significant headway dialing in the rolling mill and caster as we bring online a mill with the broadest offering of plate products in the Western hemisphere. Every month, we continue increasing casting rates and the range of production capabilities. Over the balance of 2023 we expect the Brandenburg Mill will produce up to 500,000 tons of steel and turn profitable by year’s end. This game-changing plate mill gives us a unique capability and will play a pivoted role in building out our nation's infrastructure across multiple growth sectors.Moving to our Expand Beyond strategy, we're pleased with the success of our new platforms, especially the diversification and accelerated growth they bring to Nucor’s earning profile.As we've shared before, we look for efficient manufacturers of steel-related products when evaluating candidates to expand beyond our traditional steel making operations. The most attractive opportunities are those where we can create incremental value through operating synergies, supply chain efficiencies, and revenue enhancements. We also see companies whose values match Nucor’s, especially when it comes to taking care of their team.As part of our Expand Beyond strategy, Nucor established four new platforms helping to grow the size and diversity of our Steel Product segment. In the past three quarters in which we've owned these platforms, they have generated combined EBITDA of roughly $350 million or annualized EBITDA of approximately $465 million, which puts them on track to reach the $700 million through cycle annual EBITDA goal we described at our Investor Day in November.In the first quarter, steel products represented approximately 52% of our segment earnings mix.We plan to keep growing the earnings potential of our steel products segment over time through both organic growth and acquisitions. In fact, just last month, we announced the location of our first of two new production facilities for Nucor Towers and Structures, which will help meet the growing demands of our nation's transmission infrastructure.As we execute our Expand Beyond strategy, we are maintaining a selective and disciplined approach, seeking those that enhance our service offerings for customers and generate superior returns for our investors.Our competitive advantage lies not only in the breadth and quality of the products we produce, but in how we make them. As more customers look to reduce emissions across their supply chains the low embodied carbon and Nucor Steel is a real differentiator for us.Over the past few years, we've developed numerous supplier partnerships with the likes of General Motors and Trane. And this week we're adding to that with a supplier partnership with Johnson Controls. Nucor will recycle nearly all of the scrap from Johnson Controls facilities and repurpose it as low embodied carbon steel to be sold back to Johnson Controls for future use. This closed loop recycling partnership helps both companies pursue our decarbonization goals.In May, we will publish our updated sustainability report, which speaks to the commitment our teammates have in living our culture and protecting our environment. I encourage you to take the time to review it as it describes what makes Nucor so special. Things like our industry-leading safety record and the pride of our teammates have in working for Nucor.Being the largest recycler of any product in the Western Hemisphere allows us to make steel with a fraction of the carbon footprint compared to the global average. And the various ways we support and invest in our communities. This is what makes Nucor a world-class manufacturer as recognized by Fortune Magazine where we were ranked number one among steel companies for the second consecutive year as one of the world's most admired companies.Before turning it over to Steve, let me wrap up by sharing some perspectives on the U.S. economy. Despite the economic uncertainty, we see a constructive long-term outlook for Nucor and the broader U.S. steel industry. And when economic conditions do change, our highly variable cost structure and flexible operating model allows Nucor to toggle our production and efficiently match demand.Nucor has a track record of operating profitably through downturns and emerging from them even stronger.The long-term investments we make and our conservative capital structures are designed to withstand all economic cycles in this time is no different, but for now, the fundamentals driving non-residential construction and infrastructure projects appear to be quite healthy.Three pieces of legislation, the Infrastructure Investment Act, the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act, provide a combined $975 billion of funding or tax incentives, which will have a multiplier effect on the actual amount of capital deployed. Taken together, we believe that these three programs have the potential to generate up to 8 million tons of incremental steel demand per year over the balance of this decade.According to the American Iron and Steel Institute, an estimated 5 million tons of steel is needed for every $100 billion in infrastructure spending.On top of that, we expect IRA will derive significant investment in clean energy, adding approximately 2 million to 3 million tons of annual steel demand for wind, solar, and transmission projects. There also have been more than 30 announced semiconductor plants or expansions in response to the CHIPS Act. These are massive steel intensive factories that take billions of dollars in years to build and Nucor’s unrivaled domestic production capabilities and low carbon footprint position us favorably to provide the steel for these projects.As I've said in the past, the green and digital economies are being built with steel and the steel that they get built with matters.The future looks bright for Nucor and we're excited to continue building on our company's long track record of driving profitable growth and delivering outstanding returns to our shareholders.With that, let me turn it over to Steve Laxton, who will share additional details about our Q1 performance and outlook for Q2. Steve?Steve Laxton Thank you, Leon. Our net earnings of $4.45 per diluted share for the first quarter is the product of another strong performance by our team. In fact, with total earnings of just over $1.1 billion, our first quarter marks the eighth consecutive quarter where Nucor has exceeded $1 billion in earnings, a measure unattained prior to 2021, despite our long and profitable history as a company. These results highlight the advancement of our strategy and the growing earnings power of Nucor’s diversified portfolio and industry-leading capabilities.During the first quarter, steel mill earnings of $838 million represented a 62% increase in the prior quarter, driven predominantly by higher shipments.We also saw efficiency gains from Q1’s higher utilization rate, allowing us to achieve lower conversion cost. Improving cost for energy, alloys and consumables were also a factor.Shifting to our Steel Products segment, we again saw excellent quarterly performance with segment earnings of $971 million. While this is a slight moderation from the prior period, it remains a historically strong result. During the quarter, we realized attractive pricing from margins across many of our product lines. This performance is further evidence of the strong non-residential construction market commented on by Leon. Our Raw Materials segment produced earnings of $58 million for the quarter. We realized higher pricing in our recycling businesses and shipped higher volumes out of both DJJ scrap operations and our DRI facilities.You may recall DRI volumes in Q4 were lower than normal and large part due to planned maintenance activities.Our corporate eliminations expenses increased for the quarter in line with the outlook we shared during our fourth quarter earnings call in January. As a reminder, this segment includes several key activities including our teammate incentive compensation programs for all segments, interest expenses, selling, general and administrative expenses, and the elimination of intercompany profits.Included in this is the elimination of profits or losses on intersegment sales when one segment supplies product to another segment, but the final sale to an external customer has not yet been recognized. With roughly 20% of Nucor steel shipments going to downstream businesses and the vast majority of Nucor’s raw material shipments going to our Nucor steel segment.Our intercompany eliminations can increase or decrease meaningfully, particularly during periods of rapid price change.In addition to producing strong earnings in the first quarter, Nucor’s efficient manufacturing business model was on display again, generating cash from operations of $1.2 billion. This allowed the company to continue its long established and balanced approach toward capital allocation, investing $532 million in CapEx, while maintaining its commitment to making meaningful direct returns to shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.7 million shares valued at approximately $426 million and made dividend payments of $131 million for a total of $557 million returned directly to shareholders or 49% of our net earnings.Over the last three fiscal years, we’ve returned $7.6 billion to shareholders representing approximately half of the net earnings for the period.It’s worth noting our dividend payment in Q1 was Nucor’s 200th consecutive quarterly dividend. That’s a half a century of paying and raising our dividend and a long track record of creating shareholder returns that very few companies in any industry can point to.Nucor’s balance sheet continues to be a fundamental underpinning for Nucor’s capital allocation framework and an enabler of our value creating strategy. At quarter end, Nucor had more than $4.7 billion in cash and short-term investments, and our $1.75 billion revolving credit facility remains undrawn.Given the potential economic uncertainty, we’ve been intentional about fostering a resilient and flexible liquidity position.This position of strength gives us confidence. We can continue our balanced approach of executing Nucor’s growth strategy while also providing meaningful direct returns to shareholders.As we look ahead to the second quarter, we expect earnings from our steel mill segment to increase compared to the first quarter results on modestly higher shipments and improved margins with better results from our sheet business being the biggest driver.In our steel product segment, we expect performance will moderate slightly from the historically high earnings level of recent quarters. As the impact of lower pricing offsets the benefit we expect to see from seasonally higher volumes. Our raw material segment is expected to continue to improve on higher shipment volumes.Overall, we expect the second quarter consolidated earnings to be higher than the first quarter, and we remain optimistic that 2023 will be another strong year of earnings for Nucor.As Leon mentioned, federal support for infrastructure projects, clean energy investments and advanced manufacturing facilities will begin to impact demand in 2023.In addition, non-residential construction remains elevated and positive trends in both the automotive and energy sector will impact demand. In short, we believe medium and long-term fundamentals of our industry and key demand drivers remain relatively positive. This coupled with our strategy to grow our core and expand beyond position Nucor for strength well into the future.With that, we’d like to hear from you and answer any questions you might have. Operator, please open the line for Q&amp;A.See also 11 Best Counter Cyclical Stocks To Buy Now and 15 Biggest Airplanes in the World in 2023.Question-and-Answer SessionOperator: Thank you. We’ll now begin the question-and-answer session.[Operator Instructions] Today’s first question comes from Emily Chieng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.Emily Chieng Good afternoon, Leon, Steve and team. Thank you for taking my question. My first one is just around the state of the steel market outlooks as you see it. I guess could you help us provide some color around what level of confidence you have or what’s sort of the extent of your visibility around the outlook for steel demand in this current macro environment? And how that perhaps compares to other economic down cycles that we’ve seen in the past?Leon Topalian Yes, Emily, thanks for the question. I’ll kick it off. For the last three years, we have been focused on executing on our mission, which is to grow the core, expand beyond and live our culture, ultimately generating higher highs and higher lows and providing a capability set to our customers that provides them a differentiated value proposition.And so while there’s an awful lot of talk about looming recessions and headwinds we’re facing and whatnot, I just tell you that the objective measures as we look into Q2, we think Q2 is going to be a stronger quarter.If we look at our backlogs, our steel segment backlogs, Emily have increased 30% from the lows in the fourth quarter of last year.The demand picture as we think about automotive approaching 15 million units in 2023 remains really bright. And then some of the other things that I mentioned the opening script like the IRA and CHIPS Act and the Infrastructure Bill are already having meaningful impacts in our business segments today.But if we just take and unpacked just for a second the CHIPS Act, a $55 billion act signed into law, that $55 billion investment has spurred 34 projects that are on the books today. Those 34 projects represent $374 billion of semiconductor factories that are going to be built in the United States. And as our customers continue to shift to higher demands in what they’re looking for and what were in body carbon, it sets up incredibly well for Nucor as the most diversified product offering everywhere to help them build those facilities.Then the full cycle of that is, as they build those facilities, they’re going to provide the chips to our end use Tier 1 automotive customers, our HVAC customers and our heavy equipment customers that are all waiting for those and we’re ready to grow at that demand.So again, we look forward to, and I think the brightest days for Nucor are still in front of us. And yes, that’s really where I would point to. And again, non-res construction continues to be incredibly resilient and we think strong going forward.Emily Chieng Great, that’s really helpful, Leon. And a follow-up, if I may, around non-resi construction demand there, you’ve certainly positioned yourself quite well with the cash flow business, the warehouse racking piece there, but as you think about the mix shift in projects within this segment. Where are you seeing a lot of pent up demand for certain non-resi construction product types and what are the projects that you are seeing Nucor specifically benefit the most from?Leon Topalian Yes.Look, I appreciate that question and we are excited. We’re incredibly excited about the expand beyond piece of our businesses, the warehouse systems, the racking, the CHI Overhead Doors, and what those teams have been able to already generate in their earnings power and we’re just getting warmed up. I’m going to ask Chad Utermark, who’s over that product group and as well as the new markets and innovation teams to give you some more flavor.But I would just remind you all that, hey, that’s a segment in the construction and non-res. It represents over half of Nucor’s overall mix. It’s a market we know incredibly well, a customer base that we’ve had for going on six decades now, and one that we continue to partner with to provide a differentiated value proposition.Our investment strategies were two-thirds of the way through a $14 billion capital campaign that’s going to double Nucor’s earnings powers from pre-pandemic levels. So Chad, why don’t you provide Emily just a little more detail in what we’re seeing in the non-res sector and some of the optimism we have.Chad Utermark Yes, thank you, Leon, and hello, Emily. Thank you for the question. As Leon stated, we are very excited about the demand picture that we see in non-res. I would categorize it as healthy and resilient as we move into Q2 and Q3. Some datasets I’d like to give you would be when you look at our backlogs, most of our downstream construction product backlogs are still at historically strong levels. As an example, two of our largest businesses that serve the non-res business they’re combined backlogs are 56% higher than their average during the time period of 2017 and 2019.So you can see the health of these backlogs as we go through the year.We’re not seeing a lot of cancellations at this time as well. So we feel strong about our backlog. Dodge Construction forecast, the recent numbers are positive both in dollars and square footage when you look at the non-res space. And again, it’s obvious that the activity have come off the 2022 peaks, but they really remain above pre-pandemic levels. And what dataset I was looking at the 2023 Dodge projected non-res building starts when you look at square footage, it’s up 15% compared to that 2017, 2019 average, which was some good years.So we feel really good about what we’re seeing and then we always base these datasets compared to what we’re hearing from our customers.And our customer feedback is still positive in the non-res space. Part of your question was about new markets or new channels, and we all know that warehouse obviously was extremely strong in 2021 and 2022, and it is come off those peaks and it’s level setting and find recalibrating and finding its place.But I would remind you that even with that level setting, it’s still forecasted the warehouse space to exceed the 2018 and 2019 demand levels for warehouses, which was historic prior to COVID. So one of those areas that Leon touched on that I want to just mention would be the excitement we have around the onshoring of manufacturing. It’s strong and it keeps pushing forward. Projects such as the semiconductor chip plants, data centers, EV facilities, both the assembly facilities as well as the battery plants.They’re in our backlog and we’re quoting even more of them.Again, I’ll say it, the manufacturing sector is very strong, and let me share this dataset with the construction spending in this segment alone has nearly tripled since 2018 and 2019 levels. We’re talking about close to $100 billion of spin projected in this segment alone. So while warehouse has come off its level setting, we’re really excited about the manufacturing sector.Emily Chieng Fantastic. That’s very helpful.Operator Thank you, Emily. Ladies and gentlemen, our next question comes from Lawson Winder with BofA Securities. Please go ahead.Lawson Winder Hello gentlemen, good morning. Thank you for your presentation and congratulations on a great quarter. Wanted to ask about again, about the ramp up of Brandenburg, the cadence you see there in terms of the quarterly ramp.Thank you.Leon Topalian Yes. Thanks, Lawson. I’ll let Al Behr kind of give you some details and then back row on our Brandenburg ramp up. Al?Al Behr Yes, Lawson, thanks for the question. The Brandenburg ramp up continues to go really well. We shared there in the slide deck a couple of milestones again, that the strategy has always been about capabilities and not capacity. And so we continue to develop and explore the capabilities of this terrific machine. And we’ve rolled plate that is over 6 inches thick, which is a new milestone for us. We’ve rolled finished plate out of ingots, which is a significant milestone. We’re producing our own slabs now out of the caster, and this is one of the most capable casters, the most capable in the Western hemisphere.And so the wrap up is just going the way we’d like to see it.We still feel good about our commitment about 50 – excuse me, 500,000 tons by the end of the year. Obviously that’s heavily weighted into the back end of the year because we’re focused on capabilities. But we’re excited about what this project is going to offer our customers and ready to serve them.Lawson Winder Okay. That’s fantastic. And then if I could follow-up just up on the plate market and get your views and get an idea for what you’re seeing in terms of tightness in the market looking out to Q3 and into the end of the year.Al Behr Yes. Gosh, you start talking end of the year, you’re beyond my crystal ball, but I’ll share some thoughts of what we see now. And it is a fairly tight market. Demand is pretty good for plate.Our backlogs are up 100% year-over-year, even more than that quarter-over-quarter. So we issued a price increase. We published our prices and plate. As you probably are aware, we published an increase last night of $40 a ton. Inventories are low. There’s not a lot of slack in the supply chain. So we see continued strength in the plate market. It remains one of our more resilient markets. And I would highlight within that things like railcar manufacturing, non-res, bridge work as a result of some of the legislative successes that Leon’s highlighted. So, overall we’re pretty positive.Lawson Winder Okay. Fantastic. Thank you very much.Al Behr Thanks, Lawson.Operator And my next question today comes from Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley.Please go ahead.Carlos De Alba Yes. Thank you very much, gentlemen. So question is given the positive comments that you have on non-resi and all the term that you mentioned, how can we reconcile the year-on-year growth in your bars and structural the steel mill shipments, they declined 3% in the bars, as you know, and 60% structural. So I don’t know if you could provide some color to help us understand these numbers. And then maybe a follow-up on this – on Slide 8 of your presentation, the Dutch construction forecast is very clear that infrastructure continues to increase in the coming years. There is a little bit of plateau or flatness in non-resi and then it increases. But that is in terms of dollars, there is a line there in that chart that is non-residential building starts in 1 million of square feet.And that is – that comes down from 2023 to 2024, and then it increases from 2024 to 2027, but it’s only a gradual moderating increase. What drives your shipments? Is it more the dollar amount or the square footage of the projects that are put in place?Leon Topalian Carlos, it’s a bunch of questions. I’ll kick it off and maybe ask John Hollatz or Chad or Steve to jump in. I want to step back though to the broader sort of global environment. As you think about rebar and bar and longs, I want to begin with the humanitarian crisis in Turkey and the travesty that has befallen that nation. Obviously with zero imports coming out of Turkey in the last couple of months, they’re consuming a lot of that. Our long product businesses, in general, have provided incredible returns through a very, very long cycle for Nucor that remaining incredibly robust.And so as we think about, again, Q2 we’re positive. We look forward to again, a stronger quarter in the second quarter. As you mentioned, the structural side of things as well, maybe just very quickly touch on what you’re seeing in the project of the coming months in the structural side, John, why don’t you finish up on the long products?Al Behr Yes, some structural things. I would say the structural market is not as strong as the plate market. It remains resilient, and we see some activities in nonres construction, but it’s not as strong as what we’re seeing in some other products. But the strength is resurging in these areas of reshoring of manufacturing in the chips plants; those are areas where we’re particularly strong, both on the mill side and the downstream product side.So, I may have missed your specific question about reconciling shipments. All I’m giving you some color that’s helpful. But John, anything else on the bar side that you can share?John Hollatz Yes. I would say I think part of your question, Carlos, is what drives the steel intensity or the overall demand for steel. It’s more going to be on square footage than dollars. Obviously, there’s some inflationary impact on the dollar side. What we’re seeing with these chip facilities as they are very steel intense because of the enormous foundations that go into facilities like this, which gives us a lot of optimism that demand is going to remain strong, not just through 2023, but for the life cycle of this government spending. So, we see a lot of resilience in the market moving forward.Carlos De Alba Great.Thank you very much.Operator Thank you. And our next question today comes from Curt Woodworth with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.Curt Woodworth Yes, thank you. Good afternoon, Leon and Steve.Leon Topalian Hey, Curt.Curt Woodworth Just want to get your thoughts on the sheet market, right? So if we look at the second half of last year, the economy is still reasonably strong. Nonres was doing well, auto admittedly weaker and the pricing average around $750 a ton more or less, and here we are today, the pricing is $1,200, and arguably, maybe there’s a little bit more supply from some of the new EAF mills in the market, the lead times are out, and I’m not sure that the real economy is that much stronger today than it would have been back half of last year.So, I’m just curious how – what would you explain kind of the – how would you characterize the move in the market this year, if you could kind of parse out some of the key moving pieces?And then the second question just pertains to the steel products division. That business is, I think, is a little bit more complicated for investors to parse out. So could you kind of maybe for size at the joist and deck business versus your rebar fab business – and then within the context of IRA, semiconductors, infrastructure, where do you really play in some of those markets? Is some of that more joist and deck specific versus pure rebar fab or other areas, obviously, like towers for energy infrastructure? Thank you guys.Leon Topalian Okay. Curt, I’ll kick this off and again a bunch of different questions in there, and we’ll try to make sure we cover them all if we don’t just ask again.But let me begin with the tail end of your question. As we think about the IRA, the Chips Act and infrastructure, in the macro, we see about – is upwards of about 8 million tons of annualized capacity for the next 10 years. So if you think about 8 million tons, that’s roughly 7% of the overall ADC [ph] of this country. It is not an inconsequential number. And so well, how does that flow through? And how does that break down in the steel intensity within those three.Well, number one, it marries up incredibly well to the most diversified steel industry leader in Nucor. It matches up really well with the lowest in body carbon footprint of any steelmaker in the world that our customers are demanding these days, but it’s coming in the form of plate, structural longs, rebar, sheet, joist and deck, fasteners, buildings, warehouse systems, racking, it really is the breadth of our portfolio that is on display today.So it’s touching every segment of Nucor’s businesses.And again, with what Chad described, and again, we – we’ve worked really hard commercially in Dan Needham’s group with how we provide solutions and looking not to sell products, but how do we provide and partner with a customer to take care of their entire needs of that building envelope from the foundation all the way through to completion.As we’ve shifting a little bit to your question on sheet, and I’ll ask Rex to touch on this as well. But I would tell you in the macro, no, we do say Q1 showing more favorable demand in the back half of 2022. And so, there’s strength there. And again, ultimately drives that is our customers. It’s a supply and demand market. That’s why we’re seeing pricing go up and stick because the demand is up, the drivers are up.Our sheet business alone, Q over Q was up about 20%. Backlogs are up about 25% Q over Q. So there is real strength there. There’s – and there’s some optimism there and how we see that moving forward. So Rex maybe provide a little bit more of a picture within the sheet group and what you’re seeing through the back half of or the rest of 2023.Rex Query Yes, Curt. Thanks for the question. Actually, I’ll step back for a moment. From a big picture standpoint, looking at 2022 as you recall, with Russia’s invasion Ukraine and some uncertainty going on, you have things going on in the marketplace where customers began, I’d say placing orders in accumulating some inventory due to that uncertainty. So with uncertainty in the pipeline supply chain from that standpoint.So you saw the back half of 2022 where some of that was being worked through. So we saw some softness occurring as people working through inventory.So then you didn’t see the – I’m going to say the demand pulled through on the production side. They were working through some inventory. So we saw that softness. But – and I would say overall uncertainty from an economy standpoint. But now as we’ve entered 2023, I would tell you, we see a much more stable market. We see more confidence in the marketplace and underlying demand, and we’ve seen that on the sheet side. So you’ve now seen stabilizing in some pricing at a higher level. And we see that demand stabilizing our backlogs at this point are on par with where we were in the – at the end of first quarter in 2022.So we see that strength and as we move forward Q2 and even in the Q3, we see that continuing and more confidence in the underlying demand. Hopefully that’s helpful.Curt Woodworth Thanks, Rex. I think on joist and deck…Steve Laxton Yes. Hey, Curt. This is Steve. Just real quickly on your second question there about joist and deck and rebar fab. To give you a sense for size, joist and deck is typically about 25% of our products group’s volume. It’s a little bit higher than that in the first quarter. It’s around 27%. And rebar fab is in that same ballpark, usually a little bit under 25% of the volume we do on products. It’s in the low 20s right now. But those are typical for those businesses about what they represent for the products group.Curt Woodworth Great.Thank you very much guys.Leon Topalian Thanks, Curt.Operator Thank you. And our next question today comes from Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.Timna Tanners Yes. Hey, good afternoon, team. Why don’t to probe a little bit more the Gallatin ramp up, and I know in the past couple years you’ve talked about pulling back production if market conditions warranted. But it’s also been some talk of you’ve got this asset and you want to run it. So I’m just kind of wondering about the cadence of, first off, when does it run full out? And then would you expect it to continue to run at a pretty full clip once it started up? Thanks.Rex Query Yes, Timna. This is Rex. Appreciate the question. I’ll go ahead and just pick that up.First I’ll just comment at Gallatin at this point. We’re now over 190 days without a recordable at that team in it. Going through this ramp up process, it’s just really been impressive to watch the focus there. And at this point, I would tell you for all intents and purposes, our commissioning is basically complete. We’ve had the opportunity. I would tell you, we have the luxury as a company, the breadth of capabilities we have at other plants to support the work that’s been done at Gallatin. We utilized that fully in supplying our customers from other plants or substrate into Gallatin where we utilized the pickle galv [ph] line, which has continued to run in a tremendous fashion.So we utilized that as a group and we approached it as a group.So we didn’t have to get tons through Gallatin for ton’s sake. And I think Al mentioned this about Brandenburg on a focus on capabilities. At this point, we’ve commissioned full capabilities at Gallatin. And so you’ll begin to see us now focusing on quality and ramp up of the tonnage subject to market conditions as we get into second quarter. I would tell you we expect to be at full run rate capability by the end of second quarter, and then we'll gauge that based on the market, but it's been a great ramp up. We've done it as a team, as a group excited, the new capabilities thicker slab that we have will be higher quality capabilities and we'll be able to get into markets that we have not previously been into, and of course, the wider width we have there at Gallatin.Timna Tanners Okay, interesting.Thanks. My second question is obviously you have a huge position with service centers and they're an important counterparty for you. And our channel checks are suggesting that there are some challenges there as you can imagine with higher interest rates and also access to capital in light of banking market conditions. So just wondering if you have any observations about any impact on service center buying habits right now? Thanks.Leon Topalian Yes. Look in inventories, Timna, as you know and you're looking at the MSCI data, like we remain pretty flat, and so as you see particularly in cheap pricing coming through and the stability of that, it's a good indicator noting that we're not pulling orders forward from Q2 early because of those moves.So I would tell you while they remain at pretty flat and low numbers, look they're going to be cautious as well. Interest rates are having a big effect on them, but many of our end market customers as well are watching and evaluating projects and expansions based on what we're going to see from the Fed here next month and throughout the rest of the year. So it is touching obviously a big swath of our customers and like you we're watching all of those indicators and trying to analyze, how does that shape out. But we've been partners with our major service center customers for a long time. We're taking care of their needs and continue to do so well under the future.Timna Tanners Okay, great. Thanks very much.Leon Topalian Thanks Timna.Operator And our next question today comes from Tristan Gresser with BMP.Please go ahead.Tristan Gresser Yes. Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one in your comment you said that you're already seeing an impact on infrastructure manufacturing. I thought it would be more of a theme for the next quarter and maybe later in the year. So can you discuss a little bit timing? Have you seen things accelerate a bit? One of you competitor mentioned a very strong month of March on the non-res side. So yes, just some questions around the timing there and if you're seeing maybe those orders coming in faster than expected?Leon Topalian Yes. I'm not sure. They're faster, Tristan. What I would tell you is it's nice to see them actually materialized and so through February, March are Plate businesses, our Rebar businesses.Again the long product businesses are seeing, the order activities increase, the quoting increase and actual orders and production increase so that's taking shape as we speak. But we expect that to ramp up in the back half of 2023 even further. And again, somewhere in that 5 million to 8 million tons annually of production increase throughout the next eight to 10 years as we build out all these major projects. So guys, I didn't miss anything there, anything you'd add?Tristan Gresser Thank you. And maybe follow-up on that and thank you for the presentation, that's really helpful. The three poles of demand, you flagged the infrastructure, the clean energy and the manufacturing. Would you be able to break down for each of those three poles of demand, the split between let's say long, flat and plate?Is that something you could do?Leon Topalian Yes, we can do that. I'm not sure we'll do it on the call, but Tristan, it's something we can have our IR team follow-up with you and then give you some more details. But again one of the things to keep in mind is we think about those three projects; the breadth of Nucor's capabilities set positions us incredibly well. It's going to touch every major product group that we have. And we're really excited about the expand beyond capabilities. When you think about the overhead door businesses, the racking business is combined with the joist and deck and the building systems group going to market together as one. We are providing a solution set no one in the industry has today. So we'll get you some, some more information here Jack can follow up with you in the coming days, but maybe provide a little bit more of that breakdown.Tristan Gresser All right.Appreciated. Thank you. Leon Topalian Thanks, Tristan. Operator And our final question today comes from Alex Hacking with Citi. Please go ahead. Alex Hacking Hi, thanks. I just have a couple of quick follow-ups. Firstly, on joist and deck, the weakness there, is that just purely the slowdown we’ve seen in the warehousing build-out. And then secondly, on sheet, just to clarify there, I think, some of your comments, obviously, your sheet shipments are extremely strong. I think we’ve seen that across the industry. You mentioned that comparing it to 4Q. 4Q saw a lot of destocking. Is your view that the current level of sheet shipments is reflective of underlying demand? Or is there a restocking element that we closing those shipments? Thank you very much.Leon Topalian Yes.I’ll maybe kick it off and then Steve or Rex, I would tell you, no, I don’t think it’s restocking. If you look at the MSCI numbers are hovering around the two months on hand, which, again historically has been low. I don’t know and I don’t, we don’t anticipate these jumping to three or four anytime soon. I think that’s going to be a balanced approach for what Timna asked about interest rates and then again availability. So what I would tell you is, yes, you saw a large increase in our sheet group that is real demand. But does that – stack in that continue? Well, look, we think second quarter is going to be strong. But as we play out the rest of the year, we’ll have to sort of wait and see. But the increase within that – if you broke out that increase in shipments, some of that is the loss of imports.We’ve seen the imports drop off significantly Q-over-Q.And some of that is also establishing different partnerships with our commercial teams and how we’re going to market. We mentioned in my opening remarks, the relationships and partnerships we have with Train [ph] and General Motors and Johnson Controls. And there’s another 20 customers like that, that we’re partnering with different to provide them something unique and again, a very differentiated value proposition.Chad Utermark Yes. I’ll just jump in on the nonres part of your question, Alex. As we mentioned, manufacturing is robust and I would say, get ready infrastructure is going to be coming to support where we’re going. But you asked about the drop off. And it really is, I believe, led by warehousing has dropped off significantly from these peaks.I would just remind everyone how high that peak went and where we’re at today compared to historical levels is still pretty healthy on the warehousing side. But that – your question was what drove the drop off, and I would say warehousing was the big market.Alex Hacking Thank you.Leon Topalian Thanks, Alex.Operator Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer session. I’d like to turn it back over to the management team for any final remarks.Leon Topalian Well, thank you. And in closing, I want to thank our Nucor team for their incredibly strong start to 2023 and your continued focus on our most important value to health, safety and well-being of our team. I want to thank our shareholders for your investment and your trust.We take that stewardship incredibly seriously. We appreciate the opportunity to serve you in our customer base. Thank you all for your interest in Nucor, and have a great day.Operator Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. We thank you all for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.]"

15,e17183c0-9d51-3f5c-b79e-b7ff26c61b59,UNM,2023-04-28,Analysts Estimate Trupanion (TRUP) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-trupanion-trup-report-140202033.html,1682604122,STORY,"['TRUP', 'UNM']","[The market expects Trupanion (TRUP) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 4, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis provider of medical insurance covering cats and dogs is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.28 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -833.3%.Revenues are expected to be $251.88 million, up 22.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 5.69% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Trupanion?For Trupanion, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -16.20%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Trupanion will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Trupanion would post a loss of $0.30 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.23, delivering a surprise of +23.33%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Trupanion doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsUnum (UNM), another stock in the Zacks Insurance - Accident and Health industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $1.65 for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +21.3%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $3.06 billion, up 2.1% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Unum has been revised 1.9% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.30%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), suggests that Unum will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

QRVO is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results on May 3, after the closing bell. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 17.19%. It pulled off a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 8.44%, on average. The leading provider of core technologies and radio frequency (RF) solutions is likely to have witnessed a top-line decline year over year owing to macroeconomic uncertainty, stiff competition and soft demand trends.Factors at PlayDuring the fourth quarter, Qorvo launched single-chip battery management solutions to support battery packs with up to 20 cells in a series. There is a rising demand for longer battery backup, lightweight and fast-charging facilities. The newly-introduced PAC22140 and PAC25140 Power Application Controller (PAC) devices would address these needs as it reduces cost by around 30% and PCB (Printed Circuit Board) improve space utilization by more than 50%. The battery management solution consists of a low-power hibernate mode, which allows long storage time. It’s integrated high-voltage buck also reduces the thermal issue. This is expected to have a positive impact on company’s fourth quarter performance.In the to-be-reported quarter, Qorvo introduced an advanced power solution for phased array systems. The three-chip solution for commercial and defense radar systems optimizes performance, reduces operating costs and reduces system volume by 30%. The first chip, known as the 'ACT43950', is a high-voltage constant-current capacitor charge controller that helps minimize the power storage capacitor requirements. The second chip, the ACT43850, is designed to minimize noise and improve the radar array's overall performance. The third chip, the ACT43750, a highly-integrated drain switch and negative gate voltage regulator, minimizes the impact of device aging and temperature on RF performance. These developments are likely to have cushioned the top line.Intense competition from established players and emerging companies is likely to have strained the company’s margins. Qorvo generates a significant portion of its revenues from a small number of key customers, including major smartphone manufacturers. Lack of diverse revenue stream is making it more vulnerable to global uncertainty and economic downturns. Weak end market demand, supply chain issues and macroeconomic challenges are likely to have hurt the company’s fourth-quarter performance.For the March quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $621 million, indicating a decline from $1,166 million reported in the prior-year quarter. The consensus mark for earnings is currently pegged at 12 cents per share. It reported earnings of $3.12 per share in the year-earlier quarter.Story continuesEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not predict an earnings beat for Qorvo this time around.

AA is a common autoimmune disease that is associated with a severe psychological burden yet there are few effective treatments that are safe for long-term use. Farudodstat potently inhibits key drivers of AA disease pathophysiology and has the potential to be a novel, first-in-class treatment. This quarter we also announced strong support from BVF Partners and additional investors on a $20 million financing which we expect will enable sufficient runway for the company as we look forward to three possible clinical readouts in the next 12 months.”Story continuesFirst quarter 2023 and recent business highlights Q1 and recent clinical developments In January, ASLAN and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc (NYSE: TMO) announced a partnership to manufacture a high concentration formulation of eblasakimab for Phase 3 clinical trials. Thermo Fisher will manufacture this formulation of eblasakimab that ASLAN has developed, allowing up to 400 mg to be administered in a single, subcutaneous injection and suitable for use with different devices.In February, the final patient was enrolled in the TREK-AD (Trials with EblasaKimab in Atopic Dermatitis) study, a Phase 2b, dose-ranging, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of eblasakimab in adults with moderate-to-severe AD. ASLAN expects to report topline data from the study that is evaluating the efficacy and safety of eblasakimab in biologic naïve AD patients over a 16-week treatment period in early July 2023.In February, ASLAN announced the advancement of its clinical program to investigate farudodstat in a Phase 2a, proof-of-concept trial as a potential first-in-class treatment for AA. Farudodstat is 30-fold more potent than approved drugs in its class and has demonstrated a well-tolerated safety profile. The trial will recruit around 60 AA patients in the US and enrollment is expected to begin in the second quarter of 2023. The interim, topline readout following the first 12-week treatment period is expected in the first quarter of 2024 and will inform the design of the subsequent, Phase 2b, dose-ranging study.In March, two abstracts showcasing new data on eblasakimab were accepted for poster presentation at the first meeting of the International Societies for Investigative Dermatology (ISID), taking place from May 10 to 13, 2023, in Tokyo, Japan. The abstracts published online in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology explore eblasakimab’s efficacy across different body regions in AD patients including difficult-to-treat areas, such as the head and neck, and its potential for alleviating the underlying itch and hypersensitized sensory nerve fibers through multiple molecular pathways in AD.In April, two additional late-breaker abstracts were accepted for presentation at the ISID meeting. The late-breaker abstract on eblasakimab and the differences between IL-13Rα1 and IL4R blockade on Type 2 and Type 1 signalling in AD was accepted for oral presentation and the late-breaker abstract on the role of farudodstat in a human ex vivo model of AA was accepted for poster presentation. Additional details from the late-breaker abstracts will be shared after presentation at the conference.Corporate updates In February, ASLAN announced that it entered into a definitive purchase agreement (Purchase Agreement) to raise gross proceeds of approximately $20 million resulting from the sale of its ordinary shares (or pre-funded warrants) and accompanying purchase warrants, at a purchase price of $0.178 per ordinary share (or the equivalent of $4.45 per American Depositary Share (“ADS”) after giving effect to the ADS Ratio Change described below) to BVF Partners, K2 HealthVentures and certain existing investors. In addition, ASLAN has the potential to receive up to an additional $80 million in proceeds if all purchase warrants issued in connection with the Purchase Agreement are fully exercised.In March, ASLAN’s management team hosted a virtual farudodstat Research and Development Day with Key Opinion Leader, Brett King, MD PhD, Associate Professor of Dermatology, Yale University School of Medicine, to discuss the unmet medical need in AA and the potential for farudodstat to be a novel, first-in-class treatment for AA patients. A replay of the event and presentation materials are available within the Investor Relations section of ASLAN’s website.In March, Alan Bianchi was appointed as Commercial Lead Advisor for eblasakimab. Alan is a biopharmaceutical marketing executive with extensive product commercialization and launch experience in dermatology and immunology. He held the role of Head, HCP marketing at Sanofi for the US launch of dupilumab and, most recently, was the Executive Director and US Marketing Lead for the global launch of tralokinumab at LEO Pharma.Anticipated upcoming milestones New clinical and translational data on eblasakimab will be presented at the ISID Meeting in Tokyo, Japan, including a podium presentation for the late-breaker abstract. New translational data on farudodstat will be shared as a poster presentation. Posters will be available to view at the meeting from May 10, 2023, and will be uploaded to the “Publications” section of ASLAN’s website.The first patient is expected to be enrolled in the farudodstat Phase 2a, proof-of-concept study in AA in the second quarter of 2023.Topline data from the Phase 2b TREK-AD trial of eblasakimab is expected in early July 2023.Topline data from the TREK-DX trial of eblasakimab is expected in the first quarter of 2024.Topline interim data from the farudodstat Phase 2a, proof-of-concept study in AA is expected in the first quarter of 2024.First quarter 2023 financial highlights As of March 31, 2023, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $57.5 million.Cash used in operations for the first quarter of 2023 was $19.3 million compared to $7.2 million in the same period in 2022.Research and development expenses were $14.1 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to $9.4 million in the first quarter of 2022. The increase was due to higher clinical development and manufacturing costs for the eblasakimab studies and activities to support the commencement of the farudodstat Phase 2a, proof-of concept study.General and administrative expenses were $4.0 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to $2.5 million in the first quarter of 2022. The increase was mainly driven by costs related to financing activities completed in the first quarter and increase in corporate activities.Net loss attributable to stockholders for the first quarter of 2023 was $19.1 million compared to a net loss of $12.9 million for the first quarter of 2022.The weighted average number of ADSs outstanding in the computation of basic loss per share for the first quarter of 2023 was 14.8 million (representing 370.7 million ordinary shares) compared to 13.9 million (representing 348.7 million ordinary shares) for the first quarter of 2022.At the opening of trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market on March 13, 2023, the Company effected a change in the ratio of its ADSs to its ordinary shares from one (1) ADS representing five (5) ordinary shares to one (1) ADS representing twenty-five (25) ordinary shares (ADS Ratio Change). For the Company’s existing ADS holders, the ADS Ratio Change had the same effect as a one-for-five reverse ADS split.

(NYSE:TMO) insiders who sold US$1.3m worth of stock earlier this year are probably glad they did so as market cap slides to US$206b,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thermo-fisher-scientific-inc-nyse-140037843.html,1682604037,STORY,['TMO'],"[By selling US$1.3m worth of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) stock at an average sell price of US$583 over the last year, insiders seemed to have made the most of their holdings. After the stock price dropped 8.1% last week, the company's market value declined by US$18b, but insiders were able to mitigate their losses.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific Thermo Fisher Scientific Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Independent Director, Jim Manzi, sold US$585k worth of shares at a price of US$585 per share. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$533. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.Insiders in Thermo Fisher Scientific didn't buy any shares in the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At Thermo Fisher Scientific Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Thermo Fisher Scientific. In total, Independent Director Jim Manzi sold US$585k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Does Thermo Fisher Scientific Boast High Insider Ownership?I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Thermo Fisher Scientific insiders own about US$294m worth of shares (which is 0.1% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Thermo Fisher Scientific Insiders?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. While conducting our analysis, we found that Thermo Fisher Scientific has 2 warning signs and it would be unwise to ignore them.But note: Thermo Fisher Scientific may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's 1.96% gain on the day. At the same time, the Dow added 1.57%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 3.03%.Heading into today, shares of the fertilizer maker had lost 1.08% over the past month, lagging the Basic Materials sector's gain of 0.17% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 2.19% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from CF Industries as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be May 1, 2023. The company is expected to report EPS of $2.63, down 37.53% from the prior-year quarter.

Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseBaxter International Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Baxter International Inc. Quote Summing UpBaxter ended first-quarter 2022 on a positive note, wherein both revenues and earnings beat estimates. However, the company witnessed lower sales across five of its business units. Contraction in growth rates across two geographies — Americas and APAC — as well as in gross and operating margins is concerning. Unfavorable currency movement hurt the sales growth rate.Although majority of its segments ended in red, the company expects demand for its medically essential products to continue amid a stabilizing macroeconomic climate and healthcare marketplace. It stated that the ongoing transformational actions, announced earlier this year, will likely boost its performance going forward.The transformational actions, which include realigning its businesses and operations into four vertically integrated global business segments, are likely to complete by July 2024. Baxter is also progressing with the proposed spin-off of Kidney Care segment — comprising Renal Care and Acute Therapies product categories — into an independent, publicly traded company. This is also a part of its transformational actions.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Baxter carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Intuitive Surgical ISRG, Chemed CHE and Edwards Lifesciences EW, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

The solid overall top-line and bottom-line performances were encouraging. Robust Product and Services revenues and geographical performances were impressive.

The system is currently the only SCS System that uses artificial intelligence to optimize and maintain pain relief using individual patient responses. Positive feedback from physicians and patients regarding the ability to deliver personalized pain relief using Nevro’s big data-backed HFX algorithm raises optimism about the stock.On the flip side, dismal bottom-line performances are disappointing. Lower international revenues on a reported basis are discouraging as well. The sustained operating loss incurred by Nevro also raises our apprehension. The contraction of the gross margin also does not bode well.

SRDX delivered an adjusted loss per share of 40 cents in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, which is wider than the year-ago quarter’s loss of 22 cents per share. However, the figure was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 49 cents per share.Our projection of loss per share was 53 cents.GAAP loss per share for the quarter was 55 cents, wider than the year-earlier loss of 29 cents per share.Revenues in DetailSurmodics registered revenues of $27.2 million in the fiscal second quarter, up 4.2% year over year. The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.6%.The fiscal second-quarter revenue compares to our estimate of $26 million.The top line was boosted by solid year-over-year product sales growth from the Medical Device business. However, this was partially offset by a decrease in Surmodics’ In Vitro Diagnostics (IVD) revenues.Segmental AnalysisSurmodics operates via two reportable segments — Medical Device and IVD.In the reported quarter, sales in the Medical Device segment summed $19.7 million, up 6.8% from the year-ago quarter on the back of commercial progress for Surmodics’ innovative thrombectomy and radial access platforms. Per management, a 23% year-over-year increase in Medical Device product sales, with significant contributions from the vascular intervention products (Pounce arterial thrombectomy and Sublime radial access platforms), and Surmodics’ performance coding region drove the segmental revenues.This figure compares to our Medical Device fiscal second-quarter revenue projection of $18.7 million.In the quarter under review, IVD sales declined by 2.1% to $7.5 million, primarily resulting from lower sales of protein stabilization products.This figure compares to our IVD fiscal second-quarter revenue projection of $7.4 million.The company also derives revenues from three primary sources — Product sales, Royalties and license fees, and Research, development and other fees.Story continuesIn the quarter under review, Product sales were $15.4 million, up 9.9% from the prior-year quarter. Royalties and license fees revenues totaled $9.4 million, down 4.2% from the prior-year quarter. Research, development and other revenues were $2.4 million, up 5.3% year over year.This figure compares to our fiscal second-quarter revenue projections of $15 million, $9.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively.Surmodics, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseSurmodics, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseSurmodics, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Surmodics, Inc. QuoteMargin TrendIn the quarter under review, Surmodics’ gross profit rose 2.2% to $21.5 million. Gross margin contracted 153 basis points to 78.9%.Selling, general &amp; administrative expenses rose 16.7% to $12.9 million. Research and development expenses declined 5.7% year over year to $12.9 million. Adjusted operating expenses of $25.9 million rose 4.3% year over year.Adjusted operating loss totaled $4.4 million compared with the prior-year quarter’s adjusted operating loss of $3.8 million.Financial PositionSurmodics exited second-quarter fiscal 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $19.2 million compared with $26.4 million at the fiscal first-quarter end. The company ended second-quarter fiscal 2023 with total debt of $29.3 million compared with $29.5 million at the fiscal first-quarter end.Cumulative net cash used in operating activities at the end of second-quarter fiscal 2023 was $16.6 million compared with net cash used in operating activities of $11.2 million a year ago.Fiscal 2023 GuidanceSurmodics has revised its full-year financial outlook.The company now projects fiscal year revenues to be within the range of $103 million-$106 million, representing an increase of 3-6% over the comparable prior-year period. This is narrower than the previous outlook of $102 million-$106 million, representing an increase of 2-6% over the comparable prior-year period. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $105.6 million.Adjusted diluted loss per share for fiscal 2023 is now expected within the range of $1.98-$1.68, compared with the prior outlook of adjusted diluted loss per share of $2.09-$1.69. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at a loss of $1.93 per share.Our TakeSurmodics exited the second quarter of fiscal 2023 with better-than-expected results. The solid uptick in the overall top line was impressive. The company registered robust revenues from its Medical Device segment, as well as from its Product sales, and Research, development and other revenues. During the quarter, Surmodics witnessed strong contributions from sales of its Pounce and Sublime products, indicating their continued solid demand. This looks promising for the stock.In March, Surmodics announced its receipt of a positive, formal feedback from the FDA related to the company’s proposed approach to submit an amended premarket approval application for the SurVeil drug-coated balloon. In April, the company announced the first successful patient use of the Sublime radial access microcatheter. These raise our optimism about the stock.However, the company’s dismal year-over-year bottom-line results in the fiscal second quarter are concerning. Lower revenues from the IVD segment and a decline in Royalties and license fee revenues are discouraging. The gross margin contraction also does not bode well for the stock. Surmodics continued to incur operating losses in the reported quarter, which further raised our apprehension.Zacks Rank and Key PicksSurmodics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation EW, Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 62 cents.Our TakeEdwards Lifesciences exited the first quarter of 2023 on a bullish note with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The company also registered year-over-year growth on both fronts. The company’s TMTT segment registered strong growth, driven by the continued adoption of the PASCAL Precision system in Europe. During the quarter, the company completed enrolment of the TRISCEND II pivotal trial for the EVOQUE Tricuspid Valve Replacement System. Further, growth within Surgical Structural Heart was lifted by the increased adoption of Edwards' premium products across all regions. The company raised its full-year 2023 guidance, which is encouraging too.However, the contraction of both margins is discouraging. The choppy market conditions due to the persistent foreign exchange impact and stiff competition within the medical device industry is a concern.Zacks Rank and Upcoming ReleasesEdwards Lifesciences currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Bio-Rad Laboratories BIO, Henry Schein, Inc.

The rise in revenues was primarily due to a 3% increase in days of care and an increase in the geographically weighted average Medicare reimbursement rate of nearly 2.9%.Roto-Rooter reported sales of $250 million in the first quarter, up 7.9% year over year.Total Roto-Rooter branch commercial revenues improved 10.1% from the last year on a 4.0% increase in drain cleaning revenues, a 10.7% rise in commercial plumbing, 26.2% growth in excavation revenues and a 7.4% hike in commercial water restoration revenues.Total Roto-Rooter branch residential revenues registered 7.5% growth over the prior-year period on a 2.9% decrease in residential drain cleaning revenues, a 3.6% improvement in plumbing, a 3.9% increase in excavation and 27.4% growth in residential water restoration.Margins in DetailThe gross profit declined 2.3% year over year to $189.5 million in the first quarter of 2023.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at $20.8, suggesting 5.6% growth over the 2022 adjusted figure.Our TakeChemed ended the first quarter of 2023 with both earnings and revenues missing estimates.On a positive note, the strong performance across both VITAS and Roto-Rooter drove the top line. Within the Roto-Rooter branch, the aggregate commercial and residential revenue growth was supported by substantial increases in commercial drain cleaning, plumbing, excavation and water restoration revenues in the quarter under review.Meanwhile, mounting costs and expenses weighed on the company’s margins. In the first quarter, 200 additional licensed healthcare staff were hired for the VITAS segment, which has negatively impacted margins by approximately 50 bps.Zacks Rank and Other Key PicksChemed currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation EW, Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

While some of the deals you get truly are good, there's a lot of psychology employed in marketing tactics to get you to find them and spend money on them.Costco's Best Deals? Employee Reveals 10 Standout Buys for Your MoneyCan't Miss: How To Build a Financial Plan From ZeroBig-box store Walmart isn't a low-price leader for nothing -- it knows how to price, market, stage and shelve items and make sure you come away from your shop feeling like you got the best deals on everything you came for and a handful of items you didn't even know you needed. Here we look at several of the ""money traps"" Walmart employs to get you to part with even more of your money when shopping there.nanoqfu / iStock.comThe Scent of Baked GoodsEveryone loves the smell of something yummy baking, from fresh bread to chocolate chip cookies, the smell of baked goods can draw you in like a cartoon character following a cloud of steam. According to the American Baker's Association, stores that include a bakery up front are more likely to draw customers in with their delectable smells and the emotional connections that it brings. Walmarts with a bakery typically put them up front, and they likely help drive sales.Take Our Poll: What Are You Worth to Your Company?jetcityimage / iStock.comA Bigger CartYou're not that gullible, you might think -- surely just having a bigger shopping cart doesn't mean you're going to buy more things. Well, according to Mashed, it might be that simple. Walmart's shopping carts are bigger than the average grocery store. While that might not drive you to buy more things straight up, when you pass a case or palette that just looks like a steal and hey, it also fits in your cart, you'll be a lot more likely to go for it than if you're carrying a basket or pushing a small cart. What's more, though they don't appear to be in effect yet, Walmart applied for a patent to create ""biometric"" shopping carts that would be able to read info like blood pressure and heart rate while you shop -- who knows how that might be used to market things to you.Story continuesSundry Photography / Shutterstock.com'Everyday Low Prices'What's wrong with low prices, you might ask? Nothing at all, and while it's often true that Walmart prices are lower on many products than at other stores, they've built in a concept that creates customer loyalty, known as ""Everyday Low Prices."" You can expect certain low prices on items all over the store, and they want to make sure you don't forget it. According to Mashed, consumer experts say that an individual store may have as many as 100 signs reminding customers of this fact. After a while, that messaging gets in your head and makes you keep coming back or purchasing more.Photointoto / Shutterstock.comPopular Items in The BackWhile every Walmart is sized differently, they range from 15,000-square-foot ""express"" stores to 260,000-square-foot ""supercenters,"" according to 24/7 Wall Street. And the more foot traffic you put into those stores, the more likely you are to see things you want to purchase. Thus, Walmart often puts popular items in the back of the store, requiring customers to traverse more products on their trek to what they need.Read: 10 Items You Should Always Buy at Dollar TreeChekyravaa / Shutterstock.comRollback PricingWalmart could just put something on ""sale"" but instead, it calls a temporary discount on an item ""rollback pricing."" This makes it sound as though it is being kind or doing customers a favor, and rolling back costs just for you. Who wouldn't want to take advantage of that? The unspoken message within this framing is that the price will eventually roll back to its original, higher price, so you should get it while it's low.Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.comThey Utilize 'Action Alley'In a big-box store, there's typically a wide aisle that runs in a big square all around the store. It can include items for sale as well as paths to walk. This is known as ""Action Alley"" and according to the 8th and Walton blog, this alley has long been a crucial part of Walmart's marketing strategy. Walmart stores tried to do away with merchandise in Action Alley around 2008 and 2009 after feedback that customers thought the aisles were too cluttered. Yet when it did, sales fell. It eventually brought them back in high traffic areas, driving sales.Here's How Much Every Living US President Is Worth: Where Does Biden Rank?QualityHD / Shutterstock.comLast-Minute NeedsThe term for buying something you didn't know you needed until you lay eyes on it is ""impulse buying"" and Walmart is notorious for stocking up on the kind of impulse-buy items that customers realize they need as they checkout: candy, small toys, magazines and other items, according to Business Insider.Take Our Poll: Are You Planning To Buy or Sell a House This Year?More From GOBankingRates10 Aldi Brand Products Worth BuyingLearn To Master Your Money With These Financial TipsHow To Build Your Savings From ScratchFinancial Insight in Your Inbox: Sign Up for GBR's Daily NewsletterThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 7 Secret Money Traps at Walmart]"

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Raymond James Financial (NYSE:RJF).

Adjusted earnings of $2.03 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.17 by a considerable margin. The bottom line, however, was up 25% from the prior-year quarter. We had projected adjusted earnings per share of $2.15.A weak investment banking performance amid heightened geopolitical and macroeconomic ambiguities hurt the Capital Markets segment’s results. Also, RJF recorded bank loan provision for credit losses during the quarter on the deteriorating macroeconomic outlook. Further, expenses increased during the quarter.Yet, higher interest rates and a rise in loan demand acted as tailwinds, which led to a substantial jump in net interest income (NII). Further, the performance of the Private Client Group was robust. Also, the acquisitions over the past years supported the company’s financials to some extent.Net income available to common shareholders (GAAP basis) was $425 million, up 32% year over year.Revenues &amp; Costs RiseNet revenues were $2.87 billion, up 7% year over year. The top line, however, marginally missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.88 billion. Our estimate for net revenues was the same as the consensus number.Segment-wise, in the reported quarter, RJ Bank registered a surge of 174% from the prior year in net revenues. Also, the Private Client Group recorded 12% growth in net revenues. Capital Markets’ top line declined 27%, while Asset Management’s net revenues fell 8%. Others recorded revenues of $10 million against negative revenues of $18 million in the prior-year quarter.Non-interest expenses rose 3% to $2.32 billion. Our estimate for non-interest expense was $2.27 billion. Also, RJF recorded a bank loan provision for credit losses of $28 million, up from $21 million in the prior-year quarter.As of Mar 31, 2023, client assets under administration were $1.22 trillion, down 3% from the end of the prior-year quarter. Financial assets under management of $194.4 billion were relatively stable.Story continuesStrong Balance Sheet &amp; Capital RatiosAs of Mar 31, 2023, Raymond James reported total assets of $79.18 billion, up 3% from the prior quarter. Total equity grew 1% sequentially to $9.88 billion.Book value per share was $46.67, up from $41.38 as of Mar 31, 2022.As of Mar 31, 2023, total capital ratio was 21.4% compared with 25% as of Mar 31, 2022.

The bottom line also grew 21% from the prior-year quarter. Our estimate for adjusted earnings was the same as the consensus number.SCHW’s results benefited from higher rates, which led to a rise in net interest income (NII). Thus, revenues improved despite lower bank deposit fees and higher volatility hurting trading income. Also, the absence of fee waivers and solid brokerage account numbers acted as tailwinds during the quarter. However, higher expenses were an undermining factor.Interactive Brokers Group’s IBKR first-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $1.35 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.40. However, the bottom line reflects a rise of 64.6% from the prior-year quarter. Our estimate for adjusted earnings was also $1.35.Results were primarily hurt by an increase in expenses. A fall in daily average revenue trades was another headwind. Nevertheless, an improvement in revenues was a tailwind for IBKR.

Moreover, the figure climbed 13.7% from the prior-year quarter’s tally.The quarterly results reflect a year-over-year increase in same-store residential rental revenues driven by solid lease rate growth. The same-store average rental revenue per occupied home and occupancy improved sequentially. AVB also raised its core FFO per share outlook for 2023.Total revenues in the quarter came in at $674.7 million, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $665.6 million.

Moreover, the reported figure climbed 15.7% year over year.This residential REIT’s quarterly results were driven by an increase in the average effective rent per unit for the same-store portfolio. MAA also raised its outlook for 2023 core FFO per share.Equity Residential’s EQR first-quarter 2023 normalized FFO per share of 87 cents increased 13% year over year but narrowly missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 88 cents.Results reflected continued healthy demand and lower-than-anticipated bad debt. EQR also noted that it experienced better payment and move-out activity related to delinquent residents than assumed in its February 2023 guidance.However, higher expenses due to repair and maintenance work resulting from severe California rain storms, coupled with increased property-related legal and administrative expenditures, acted as a dampener. Also, there was a contraction in physical occupancy.UDR Inc. UDR reported first-quarter 2023 FFO as adjusted (FFOA) per share of 60 cents, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a whisker.Revenues from rental income of $398.3 million, too, lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $404.5 million.Quarterly results reflect lower-than-anticipated revenues. A fall in occupancy and higher same-store expenses act as dampeners. Nonetheless, UDR benefited from a rise in blended lease rates and past accretive external growth investments.

47,17221422-caff-38f3-b8e8-aa9aaddfd78d,XYL,2023-04-28,Xylem (XYL) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xylem-xyl-earnings-expected-grow-140202657.html,1682604122,STORY,"['FLS', 'XYL']","[Xylem (XYL) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 4. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis water and wastewater treatment company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.62 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +31.9%.Revenues are expected to be $1.34 billion, up 5.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.33% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Xylem?For Xylem, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.89%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Xylem will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Xylem would post earnings of $0.80 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.92, delivering a surprise of +15%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Xylem appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Manufacturing - General Industrial industry, Flowserve (FLS), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.26 per share for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +271.4%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $899.73 million, up 9.6% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Flowserve has been revised 1.5% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 3.71%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), suggests that Flowserve will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Fifth, we are dynamically managing through the current environment, bolstering capital and liquidity. We're also incrementally optimizing the balance sheet and loan growth while continuing to proactively manage the expense base. Finally, we are well positioned operate through uncertainty with a focus on our long-term strategy and our commitment to top quartile returns. I believe Huntington is built to thrive during times like this, and ultimately to benefit and to capture opportunities as they arise. Moments of market disruption present opportunities to take market share, to win new customers and to hire great talent. We are confident in our strategy and strong position.Moving on to Slide 5, we entered this period of disruption in the best position the company has been since I've joined over a dozen years ago.The reputation our colleagues have created a best-in-class customer service, results in customer confidence and trust in us. The 2023 JD Power award for Customer Satisfaction reflects our colleagues' efforts. Grounded in our fairplay philosophy, we continue to acquire and deepen primary bank relationships, resulting in our granular and diversified deposit base. For many years, we focused on gathering deposits that are sticky operating accounts, and proactively placed larger deposits off balance sheet. We continue to invest across the franchise to drive deposit growth.We are also incrementally optimizing loan growth to generate the highest returns and ensure the capital we deploy is put to the highest and best use. And we remain focused on delivering the revenue synergies we previously shared, accelerating the growth of our fee businesses and deepening our customer relationships.In regards to capital CET1 increased 19 basis points from the prior quarter to 9.55%. And we plan to build capital to the high end of our range over the course of 2023. Our credit reserves are top tier in the peer group at 1.9%. We will continue to be proactive in our expense management. In the first quarter, we completed a number of actions to support our ongoing efficiency programs such as the 31 branch consolidations, the voluntary retirement program, and our organizational realignment with reductions in personnel. And in addition to operation accelerate, we have a roadmap to deliver continued efficiencies going forward. Importantly, risk management is embedded within all our business lines. At Huntington, everyone owns risk, and we continue to operate within our aggregate moderate to low risk appetite.Rawpixel.com/Shutterstock.comFinally, I want to reiterate, Huntington is built for times like this. We have a strong well diversified franchise with a distinctive brand and loyal customers. Our high-quality deposit base, robust liquidity, and solid credit metrics are the direct result of focused and disciplined execution over many years. We have an experienced management team supported by highly engaged colleagues executing on our strategy. And as you know, management is collectively a top 10 shareholder. And we are fully committed to driving top tier performance and growing shareholder value. Zach over to you to provide more detail on our financial performance.Zach Wasserman Thanks, Steve. And good morning, everyone. Slide 6 provides highlights of our first quarter results.We reported GAAP earnings per common share of $0.39, and adjusted EPS of $0.38. Return on tangible common equity, or ROTCE came in at 23.1% for the quarter, adjusted for notable items. ROTCE was 22.7%. Further adjusting for AOCI, ROTCE was 17.8%. Pre-provision net revenue expanded 41% year-over-year to $844 million. Loan balances continued to grow, as total loans increased by $1.5 billion from the prior quarter. Liquidity coverage remains robust, with over $60 billion of available liquidity representing a peer leading coverage of uninsured deposits of 136%. Credit quality remains strong, with a net charge-offs of 19 basis points and allowance for credit losses of 1.9%.Turning to Slide 7. Average loan balances increased 1.3% quarter-over-quarter driven by commercial loans, which increased by $1.5 billion, or 2.2% from the prior quarter.Primary components of this commercial growth included distribution finance, which increased $800 million tied to continued normalization of dealer inventory levels, as well as seasonality, with shipments of spring equipment arriving to dealers. Corporate and specialty banking increased $242 million, primarily driven by growth in mid-corp, healthcare and tech and telecom. Other assets financed businesses contributed growth of $216 million. Auto floorplan continued normalization, with balances higher by $214 million. Business banking also increased $92 million. In consumer, growth continued to be led by residential mortgage which increased by $316 million. Partially offsetting this growth were home equity balances, which declined by $159 million.All other categories including RV Marine and auto declined by a collective $123 million.Turning to Slide 8. We continued to deliver average deposit growth in the first quarter. Balances were higher by $472 million, primarily driven by consumer, which more than offset lower commercial balances. On a year-over-year basis, average deposits increased by $3.2 billion or 2.3%.Turning to Slide 9. I want to share more details behind Huntington's deposit franchise. Our deposit base represents a leading percentage of insured deposits at 69% as of Q1. Our deposit base is highly diversified with consumer deposits representing over half of our total deposits and the average consumer balance being $11,000.Turning to Slide 10. Complementing our diversified deposit base is the stability and growth of our deposits over time.During last year, we consistently delivered deposit growth well above peer levels despite the backdrop of rising rates and quantitative tightening. Through year-end 2022, cumulative deposit growth was 2.4%, nearly 6 percentage points better than the peer median. Over the course of Q1, monthly average deposit balances were stable at approximately $146 billion. Within consumer deposits, balances have increased for four months in a row. Total commercial balances were modestly lower, consistent with expected seasonality. During March, in addition to seasonality, commercial customers also incrementally utilized our off-balance sheet liquidity solutions.Turning to Slide 11. We have a sophisticated approach to customer liquidity management that comprises both on balance sheet deposit products as well as off-balance sheet alternatives.Over the past four years, we have invested substantially to build out these solutions to ensure we're managing our customers' overall liquidity needs. The enhanced liquidity solutions allow us to manage the full customer relationship with primary bank and operating deposits on balance sheet and utilizing our off-balance sheet solutions for investment or non-operational funds.Over the course of 2020 and 2021, we intentionally leveraged these off-balance sheet solutions in order to support our customers' excess liquidity. This resulted in fewer surge deposits coming on sheet as well as less commercial deposit runoff during 2022 compared to the industry. On a year-over-year basis, our Commercial Banking segment on balance sheet deposits increased 11% and our off-balance sheet liquidity balances increased 54%.During March, this approach yet again showed its value for both Huntington and our customers. We saw customers moving a modest amount of deposit balances into treasuries and other products, while we were able to maintain those primary operating accounts on our balance sheet.Of the total change in Commercial segment deposit balances between March 6 and the end of Q1, we estimate that approximately half the delta was attributable to normal seasonality, and the remainder was mainly the result of shifts into our off-balance sheet solutions. The bottom table highlights these movements as well as trends in the first two weeks of April. On-balance sheet deposits have returned to the March 6 level and off-balance sheet continues to grow.Turning to Slide 12.Our liquidity capacity is robust. Our two primary sources of liquidity, cash and borrowing capacity at the FHLB and Federal Reserve represented $10 billion and $51 billion, respectively, at the end of Q1. As part of our ongoing liquidity management, we continually seek to maximize contingent borrowing capacity. And as of April 14, our total cash and available borrowing capacity increased to $65 billion. At quarter-end, this pool of available liquidity represented 136% of total uninsured deposits, a peer leading coverage.On to Slide 13. For the quarter, net interest income decreased by $53 million or 4% to $1.418 billion driven by lower day count and lower net interest margin. Year-over-year, NII increased $264 million or 23%. Net interest margin decreased 12 basis points on a GAAP basis from the prior quarter and decreased 11 basis points on a core basis, excluding accretion.The reduction in GAAP NIM included 5 basis points from lower spreads, net of free funds, due to funding mix and marginally accelerated interest costs. It also included 5 basis points from the first substantive negative carry impact from our long-term downrate NIM hedging program and 3 basis points from higher cash levels.Slide 14 highlights our ongoing disciplined management of deposit costs and funding. For the current cycle to date, our beta on total cost of deposits was 25%. As we've noted, we expect deposit rates to continue to trend higher from here over the course of the rate cycle. Given the recent market environment, at the margin, we do expect a steeper near term trajectory.Turning to Slide 15. Our hedging program is dynamic, continually optimized and well diversified.Our objectives are to protect capital in up-rate scenarios and to protect NIM in down-rate scenarios. During the first quarter, we added to the hedge portfolio with both of these objectives in mind. On the capital protection front, we added $1.6 billion in additional pay fixed swaps and $1.5 billion in forward starting pay fixed swaptions. Throughout the quarter, we were deliberate in managing the balance sheet to benefit from asset sensitivity. We also incrementally added to our hedge position to manage possible downside rate risks over the longer term as well as took actions to optimize the near-term cost of the program. During the quarter, we executed a net $400 million of received fixed swaps, terminated $4.9 billion of swaps and entered into $5 billion of floor spreads.As we've noted before, our intention is to manage NIM in as tight a corridor as possible as we protect the downside and maintain upside potential if rates stay higher for longer.Turning to Slide 16. On the securities portfolio, we saw another step up in reported yields quarter-over-quarter. We benefited from higher reinvestment yields as well as our hedges to protect capital. From a portfolio strategy perspective, we expect to continue to add to the allocation of shorter duration exposures to benefit from the inverted yield curve and further enhance the liquidity profile of the portfolio. You will note that fair value marks at the end of March were lower than year-end, both in the AFS and HTM portfolios, as market interest rates moved lower sequentially.Importantly, we have also shown the $700 million total positive fair value mark from our pay fixed hedges, which are intended to protect capital.Moving on to Slide 17.Non-interest income was $512 million, up $13 million from last quarter. These results include the $57 million gain on the sale of our retirement plan services business during the quarter. Excluding that gain, adjusted non-interest income was $455 million. This result was somewhat lower than the guidance we provided in early March, driven by lower capital markets revenues given the disruptions at the end of Q1. The first quarter is generally a seasonal low for fee revenues. As we've noted previously, we see Q1, excluding the RPS sale, being the low point and for fees to grow over the course of the year, driven by solid underlying performance in our key areas of strategic focus capital markets, payments and wealth management.Moving on to Slide 18.GAAP noninterest expense increased by $9 million. Adjusted for notable items, core expenses decreased by $18 million, driven by lower personnel expense, primarily as a result of reduced incentives and revenue driven compensation. We're proactively managing expenses and have taken actions over the last several quarters to orient to a low level of expense growth in order to deliver positive operating leverage and self-fund strategic investments.Slide 19 recaps our capital position. Common equity Tier 1 increased to 9.55% and has increased sequentially for three quarters. OCI impacts to common equity Tier 1 resulted in an adjusted CET1 ratio of 7.6%. As a reminder, the reported regulatory capital framework does not include OCI impacts in the capital calculation.Our tangible common equity ratio, or TCE, increased 22 basis points to 5.7%.Note that we were holding higher cash balances at the end of Q1, which reduced the TCE ratio by 13 basis points. Adjusting for AOCI, our TCE ratio was 7.27%.Tangible book value per share increased by 7% from the prior quarter to $7.32. Adjusting for AOCI, tangible book value increased to $9.23, and has increased for the past four quarters. Our capital management strategy for the balance of 2023 will result in expanding capital over the course of the year, while maintaining our top priority to fund high-return loan growth. We intend to grow CET1 to the top end of our 9% to 10% operating range by the end of the year. We believe this is a prudent approach given the dynamic environment. Based on our expectation for continued loan growth, we do not expect to utilize the share repurchase program during 2023.Turning to Slide 20.Our capital plus reserves is top quartile in the peer group and gives us substantial total loss absorption capacity. On Slide 21, credit quality continues to perform very well. As mentioned, net charge-offs were 19 basis points for the quarter. This was higher than last quarter by 2 basis points and up 12 basis points from the prior year as charge-offs continue to normalize. Non-performing assets declined from the previous quarter and have reduced for seven consecutive quarters. Allowance for credit losses was flat at 1.9% of total loans.Turning to Slide 22. We have provided incremental disclosures on our commercial real estate balances. This portfolio is well diversified and at 14% of total loans is in line with the peer group with no outsized exposures.The majority of the property types are multifamily and industrial. Over the last two years, we have grown our CRE book at a slower pace relative to the industry and peers. We remain conservative in our credit approach to CRE with rigorous client selection. Total office CRE comprises less than 2% of total loans, and the majority are suburban and multi-tenant properties. Reserve coverage on our total CRE portfolio is 3% and the office portfolio is 8%.Let's turn to our 2023 outlook on Slide 23. As we have discussed, we analyze multiple potential economic scenarios to project financial performance and develop management action plans. We also remain dynamic in the current environment as we execute on our strategies. Our guidance is anchored on a baseline scenario that is informed by the consensus economic outlook.We have also based our guidance on a range of interest rate scenarios, bounded on the low end using the forward curve as of the end of March to one at the higher end, where rates are higher for longer with Fed funds remaining at approximately today's level over the rest of the year. On loans, our outlook range continues to be growth between 5% and 7% on an average basis. And as before, we expect this growth to be led by commercial with more modest growth in consumer.As we entered the year, we were trending to the middle to higher portion of that growth range. Given the market disruption and our incremental focus on optimizing loan growth for the highest returns on capital, we now expect to be in the lower half to midpoint of this range. On deposits, we are guided by our core strategy of acquiring and deepening primary bank relationships.We're narrowing our outlook with a slightly lower top end of the range and still expect to grow average deposits between 1% and 3%. However, the composition of deposit growth from here, we now expect to be primarily consumer-led with relatively less commercial growth.Net interest income is now expected to increase between 6% and 9%. This is driven by slightly lower loan growth and marginally higher funding costs. Non-interest income on a core full year basis is expected to be flat to down 2%. The updated guidance reflects modestly lower expected growth in capital markets fees and includes the go-forward impact of the RPS business sale. As noted, we expect Q1 to be the low point for fees, growing over the course of the year, led by capital markets, payments and Wealth Management.On expenses, we are proactively managing with a posture to keep underlying core expense growth at a very low level.We're benefiting from our ongoing efficiency initiatives, such as Operation Accelerate, branch optimization, the voluntary retirement program and the organizational realignment, providing the capacity to self-fund sustained investment in our key growth initiatives.Given a somewhat lower revenue outlook, we are taking actions to incrementally reduce the expense growth in 2023. For the full year, we now expect core expense growth between 1% and 3%, plus the incremental expenses from the full year run-rate of Capstone and Torana and the increased FDIC insurance expense. Overall, our low expense growth, coupled with expanded revenues, is expected to support another year of positive operating leverage. We continue to expect net charge-offs will be on the low end of our long-term through-the-cycle range of 25 to 45 basis points.Finally, turning to Slide 24.As you heard from Steve, the foundation we have built at Huntington over the last decade has created an institution that is well prepared for this environment. We will leverage the strength of our deposit base. We're focused on growing capital and maintaining robust liquidity. We remain disciplined in our credit posture, and we're executing our core strategy. The work we have done to build the franchise positions Huntington to outperform and be ready to opportunistically seize on pockets of growth. We will remain disciplined and dynamic in our management approach as we continue to generate long-term value for our shareholders.With that, we will conclude our prepared remarks and move to Q&amp;A. Tim, over to you.Tim Sedabres Thanks, Zach. Operator, we will now take questions.We ask that as a courtesy of peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow-up. And if that person has additional questions, he or she can add themselves back in the queue. Thank you.See also 20 Biggest Power Generation Companies in the World and 16 Largest Grocery Chains in the World.Question-and-Answer SessionOperator: Thank you. And at this time, we will conduct our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question. Manan Gosalia Hey, good morning. Tim Sedabres Good morning, Manan. Manan Gosalia As I look through your deposit flows for the quarter, you've clearly done better than peers, whether it's on total deposits or even just non-interest-bearing deposits. Can you break out what you saw in the background? Was there a lot of movement with new accounts coming in and some of those existing commercial clients moving off balance sheet?And if so, can you talk about how sticky you think some of those new account openings are?Zach Wasserman Thanks, Manan. This is Zach. I'll take that question, and it's a good one. Overall, what we saw in our deposit base during the quarter was tremendous stability and that continued, not only through the month of March, but into early April. And we've tried to provide some incremental disclosures around that, so that you could get the visibility. And for us, it's not surprising as we've noted quite a bit. It's very granular, very diversified and, overall, it didn't happen by accident, it was a function of a really long strategy we have to focus on primary bank relationships, as you know. And to develop this commercial off balance sheet capability that we described in the prepared remarks.To get to your question, in particular, what we saw generally, I would note, by the way, that when you're looking at balances on a day-by-day basis as we've provided them in that disclosure, you have to take them with a note of caution.It really matters what day of the week what week of the month, et cetera payroll days and tax payments, et cetera. Generally, we expect the end of March to be a seasonal low for commercial. And so most of the movement, around half the move we saw in commercial from, let's say, the average of March down to the end of March was really just BAU movements of commercial clients largely paying out payroll. The other half was largely movements of deposits off balance sheet as very marginal amount of customers used some of those off-balance sheet solutions to leverage that product set. Interestingly, what you can see, we provide this disclosure out into the first two weeks of April is that essentially completely came back in terms of the overall balance of commercial deposits.So it's very stable net, virtually no movement.On the question of what we saw ins and outs, we, of course, saw some acquisition and we continue to acquire in every segment that we're operating in, consumers, continue to acquire [ph] business banking and commercial as well. And so we feel good about that kind of long-term program, which is one of the things that underlies our continued expectation for its positive growth throughout the rest of this year, just continuing to stay on strategy of acquiring and deepening primary banking relationships.Manan Gosalia Great. And then just separately, can you talk about the funding and liquidity side of the balance sheet? So despite the low level of deposit outflow, I think you built up some cash and liquidity levels by taking on more wholesale funding.So how should we think about that as we get through the rest of this year?Zach Wasserman Yeah. In terms of overall funding mix, we've talked about this a number of times in prior quarters. We really like where we are coming to this rate cycle from a perspective of lots of balanced options to fund the business. We're growing loans at this point between 5% and 7% and deposits are between 1% and 3%, around 2%, call it, the midpoint of that range. So that allows us to also leverage other sources of funding to overall fund the balance sheet, and we're in a great position to be able to do that.I will tell you, internally, we really like that. It creates quite a bit of attention in the system where the next unit of of funding is coming and really that is optimized from an economic perspective.And so our expectation is to continue to essentially add to each of those funding categories over the foreseeable future while still maintaining a level that's comparatively quite good relative to history for us. So that's the overall plan. On the topic of liquidity, I would just note a couple of things. This is a key risk that the company has been focused on managing for more than a decade. We purposely create exceptionally robust pools of convention liquidity to cover any potential issue. I think we noted in the prepared -- in the deck some of the key sources of, and also noted that we continue to, over time, add to them.I will tell you that one of the statistics that's in the document today highlights $65 billion of contingent cash and borrowing capacity as of last Friday.I'm pleased to report that as of this morning, based on incremental efforts we've done now $84 million, which, in total, represents 187% of relative to our term deposits. So exceptionally strong liquidity profile, and, as I said, kind of very balanced funding mix.Manan Gosalia Great. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore. Please state your question.John Pancari Good morning. You mentioned the actions you've taken incrementally to lower expense growth across the firm. Are those actions factored into your 1% to 3% expense guidance? And also what are those actions involved? Thanks.Zach Wasserman Yeah. It's a great question, John. This is Zach. I'll elaborate on that. So the short answer to your question is yes.Our guidance of 1% to 3% underlying core growth includes those actions. And I think just back to the sort of strategic intent of it, as we've said for a while, we are very intense on driving a low level of overall expense growth and really leveraging our ongoing program of efficiency initiatives to do that even while we continue to drive outsized growth and self-fund investments within that overall low growth framework. And so as we came into this updated guidance period, and we saw somewhat lower revenue trajectory. For us, it was important and to kind of continue to execute on the discipline of driving the positive operating leverage to also ratchet down expenses. I think the kind of things that we do, we always enter the year with a contingent set of expense management options menu, you could think about it as a different kind of options we could undertake if we need to.And that's essentially what we're going to go through now. We'll modulate the pace of hiring. We'll be very judicious in the discretionary expense categories, and we will look at sort of every possible area of expense control to ratchet back expenses and offset a good amount of what was otherwise profit and revenue pressure. So that's the playbook, and we -- that's something we've done numerous signs over the course of the years. And so we feel really good about our ability to do it again now.John Pancari Okay. Great. All right. And then on the -- back to the balance sheet. Can you just give us your expectation in terms of an updated through cycle deposit beta? I believe you had expected 35% previously. But if you can update us there on what you're thinking, and also what net interest margin outlook is baked into your up 6% to 9% net interest income projection?Thanks.Zach Wasserman You got it. Let me elaborate more on that. Overall, pulling back, overall, the strategy we have is to continue to drive sustained growth in net interest income on a dollar basis, and to do that, driving continual growth in higher-term loan categories coupling that with the management of NIM around in a tight corridor as we can, where the top end benefits from our continued asset sensitivity and we stand to really benefit if rates do stay a lot higher for longer, but also at the lower end, protected with our hedge portfolio. And all that adds up to the 6% to 9% NII growth that we're guiding to.On beta, in particular to your question, it clearly is a market-positive environment, and, hence, it's realistic to expect some higher beta and, frankly, an earlier impact than we had previously seen.I do expect now a few percentage points higher than the original -- than the prior guidance of 35% beta. I will note that we provide a guidance on beta because we want to give you an indication of where we think that's going. But for us, the most important thing is the execution day-to-day of driving the deposit growth and staying incredibly disciplined in terms of the overall funding mix as I noted in my prior response.How beta ultimately plays out here over the end game is going to be clearly a function of where the yield curve goes. But I do think that a few -- a few percent higher than 35% is a reasonable range based on the new scenarios I laid out. In terms of overall spread, as we noted, we've moved the guidance range from what was previously 8% to 11% to 6% to 9%, so down about 2% in terms of that guidance range.About 40% of that is just slightly lower loan growth and the rest is spread. As I think about the kind of the way the year plays out, I would expect that kind of a more front-loaded impact of spreads than we were previously expecting. So we would expect to see $1 decline in NII, in Q2 about the same as we saw in Q1, but then growing from there. And I think the NIM range that we have there is sort of consistent with that dollar trends.John Pancari Great. Thanks, Zach. Zach Wasserman Thank you. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please state your question.Ebrahim Poonawala Hey, good morning. Zach Wasserman Good morning, Ebrahim. Ebrahim Poonawala Two questions. One, in terms of the deposit growth outlook, I think you mentioned it's expected to be more consumer-led.Just give us a sense of strategically how either the interest rate environment or the events of the last month have changed how you're thinking about deposit acquisition? And has it materially changed the pricing on new deposit growth relative to the how you thought about it back in January?Rich Pohle Yeah. Thanks, Ebrahim. Overall, I would say, as we noted, tighten the range with a kind of a lower top end but still expect growth and pretty consistent with what we had thought before in terms of the overall amount growth. So we still see nice traction -- and I think we've seen that a little bit in some of the disclosures we've given just in the first month of the first week of into, for example. With that being said, I think the mix will be different.And we now expect commercial to be largely flat from here. And really the growth to be consumer-led. Frankly, from our perspective, it's a great highlight of the strength of the consumer franchise that we've got that we can lean in now and continue to support high profit loan growth with that consumer funding. I think the dust has not fully settled in terms of all of the competitive and customer behavioral impacts of the last month, but I think one of them will clearly be more moderated commercial growth that will just be leveraging off-balance sheet structures that much more. So I'm sure that what we do have on sheet is incredibly stable.And on the consumer side, it's just running the same playbook that we have. And we have invested so much over the last few years and capabilities to build our marketing technology and customer targeting capability with the consumer that we really have the opportunity to optimize and to drive incremental consumer-oriented acquisition, not only of higher rate categories, but just fundamentally, we're growing -- we noted 2% growth in primary bank relationships on the Consumer side, 4% growth in business banking.And so it's a very balanced source of growth, and we just going to lead into it at this point to continue to grow overall balances.Ebrahim Poonawala Got it. And just as a follow-up, I guess, on the lending side. So I appreciate your comments in terms of where the growth has been in the outlook. But if you could give us a sense of just customer sentiment, given your business mix, some of the legacy TCF businesses, just the health of the economy in terms of when you speak to your customers, are you seeing a slowdown in demand also occurring at the same time, which increases the likelihood of a potential downturn and a recession based on what you're saying?Steve Steinour Ebrahim, this is Steve, and thank you for the question. We are seeing customers become more cautious, in some cases, deferring investments and/or postponing on acquisitions or other transactions.And this has increased during the quarter, it's one of the reasons we've sort of guided without changing the loan range to the lower end of that low range from where we would have been at the upper end of that loan rate at the end of '22. There's a clear -- clearly more angst about, is there a recession, and what 2024 looks. Having said that, many of these customers are doing quite well in '23 thus far and remain optimistic. But again, there's been a lot of media, a lot of headline noise and it's having an impact in addition to what the Fed's doing.Ebrahim Poonawala Thanks, Steve. Thanks for taking my questions. Steve Steinour Thanks, Ebrahim. Operator Thank you. Next question comes from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please state your question.Scott Siefers Good morning, everyone.Thank you. Hey, Zach, I was hoping you could expand upon some of the NII comments from a question or so ago. So I think if I interpreted you correctly, I guess, NII will take a step down in the second quarter. What would cause that margin or NII to start expanding from there in light of, I guess, fairly limited overall balance sheet growth through the remainder of the year? Just curious about the nuances as you see them.Zach Wasserman Yeah. I mean, mainly, it's going to be volume from there, Scott, just continue to sequentially grow loans from second into the third and third into the fourth quarter is the primary driver. We see the spreads much more flat in the back half than kind of accelerated impact. What I -- just to make elaborating a little bit on kind of the NIM trajectory that we see overly precise.When we walked into the year, we were expecting, frankly, a pretty ratable trend in NIM over the course of the year. I think at the time we provided some guidance around single-digit basis points kind of trajectory throughout the course of the year. Most of that we now see kind of front-loaded just based on the shape of the curve and kind of how the outlook has shaped up at this point. So that's really the driver. Overall, my outlook for NIM is going to be 5 or 6 basis points lower on a 400 basis to give you a sense a portion of which is yield with both of which is just funding costs being slightly higher.Scott Siefers Okay.Steve Steinour Remember, we are a large equipment finance lender. And that generally has much more activity in the fourth quarter.That's part of this second half build-a-tech, records.Scott Siefers Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then can you guys speak broadly to some of the trends you're seeing in the auto portfolio. I mean I know your portfolio, just given the quality and tenure of it, it tends to be a lot different than the industry as a whole. But at least in the media, you would think the industry is sort of collapsing, I guess. Just curious at top level trying to sort of appetite from you guys and then what you're seeing at sort of overall?Rich Pohle Scott, it's Rich. I can take that and then Zach and Steve can tack on to it. So from my standpoint, on the credit side, as we showcased during Investor Day, I mean, this is really a business we like through all sorts of cycles.I mean it just become truly the core competency of the bank. If you look at what we saw in the first quarter, it was a continued gradual normalization in both delinquencies and charge-offs. But it's still trending well below the historic losses that we would normally see. It was 14 basis points in the first quarter, up from 12 in the fourth quarter. From my standpoint, I look really closely at the origination metrics that we've got, we're still originating at FICOs north of 17-18 and the loan to values are remaining relatively constant, reflecting a little bit more mix in new versus used. So from my standpoint, we're going to expect this portfolio to continue to surpass [ph] that past performance. And unemployment rates are still low, which is certainly going to help the credit metrics here.That's the big driver of losses. So I'm feeling good about it. And maybe Zach can talk about the optimization that we've got from a return on capital standpoint.Zach Wasserman Sure. I'll just tack on to that. Just I second the comment that the first feel great about the trajectory of the portfolio and we still see sustained demand and great relationships by the way, by a dealer. So I think we're a core and integral funding partner for our dealers, which really gives us great access. In terms of optimization, that is one of the loan categories that we are actively modulating. We kind of detailed this at Investor Day last November, should you remember, that's a business that is so effectively managed with respect to pricing and volume trade-offs that you can really pull those levers quite effectively to drive higher return and higher yield times that we want to need to, and this is certainly one of them.And so we're bringing back production a bit and seeing really strong returns as a result of it. So we'll see some of that and continue to optimize as we go forward for the rest of the year. But that is still a really important business for us and one we're pleased with kind of where we have seen it. Scott Siefers Okay. Perfect. Thank you for all the color. Zach Wasserman Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. Please state your question.Zach Wasserman Hi, Erika. Erika Najarian I just had 1 follow-up question for Steve. Steve, your starting point of CET1 is 9.5%. You accrete about 20 basis points of capital or more in the quarter. And like you said, your allowance already accounts for a tougher economic environment.I think your shareholders absolutely appreciate the focus on returns. But do you see an opportunity for Huntington to perhaps, as we have a little bit more clarity on the downside to the macro backdrop, take advantage of that capital and reserve resilience, so to speak, and perhaps start thinking about being more opportunistic in market share taking?Steve Steinour Yeah, Erika, thanks for the question. We do -- we have focused on and will continue throughout the year building the capital position of the company, strengthening it. We're quite pleased with the results delivered in the first quarter and look for comparable results as we go through the year. We're intending to be at or near the high end of our CET1 rank. And we're doing that with a view that this threat of a recession is increasing.And there's also a backdrop of that there's going to be some kind of regulatory action at some point in the foreseeable future around capital requirements. So with that in mind, that's the purpose of it.Having said that, we intend to be opportunistic. We've got a lot of organic growth potential in the business lines. We're very focused on our execution. And as you saw last year with the acquisition of Capstone and Torana, we're always looking to build out ancillary fee businesses within the company. Beyond that, in times of disruptions, there tend to be people or teams that might be available, and we will again be -- look to be opportunistic there. And we see this in aggregate as a moment to take market share, and that's what we're driving towards.We're investing the businesses. The outlook Zach has shared with you, we'll have continued investment in the businesses, all of which is designed to enhance our flow our earnings and enhance our returns.Erika Najarian Got it. And just to be clear, Steve, I was asking about organic opportunities. That wasn't a hidden bank acquisition question.Steve Steinour Well, I'm glad you clarified that. I thought, you might go in a different direction.Erika Najarian Yeah, absolutely. And just as a follow-up to that, Zach, heard you loud and clear in terms of continuing to optimize the right-hand side of your balance sheet. As you think about senior debt issuance, I suspect that everything that you may be doing in the future would have lens towards the potential for TLAC eligibility.Zach Wasserman It's certainly on the thought process, yes, we're watching that development carefully.Still pretty early days, clearly to see where that might play in, but it's part of the thought process.Erika Najarian Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please state your question.Ken Usdin Thanks. Good morning. Just 1 follow-up on the capital front. Zach, you show on that Slide 19, where the current potential impact of AFS would be on CET1. I'm just wondering, do you have a rule of thumb if we kept all rates equal on just how fast that would pull to par either on a sequential basis or maybe by the end of '24?Zach Wasserman Yeah, it's a great question, and a considerable analysis of this. It's around 5% to 10% a year kind depending on which year in it is which our maturities are so like a totally flat curve basis.I'll give you a sense, we've just read this analysis on the forward curve as of March, it will be 42% recaptured by the end of 2024 in a forward curve scenario is benefiting in that one of interest rates declining relative to [indiscernible] scenario.Ken Usdin Great. Thank you. And just 1 question on the asset repricing side. You guys have some fixed rate assets that are still repricing even though I understand how you're slowing production. Just can you give us a sense on just what your front book, back book benefits are in some of your fixed rate portfolios? And have we even really started to see some of those benefits come through given where rates have moved to?Zach Wasserman Yeah, it's a great question. We look at that very carefully.And we're seeing really nice step-up in loan yields. To give you a sense, new volume rates up almost 50 basis points -- sorry, new volume up almost 70 basis points, back book up almost 50 basis points in Q1. We estimate that our loan beta at this point through Q1 is 37%, and that could easily be over the next couple of years approaching 60% so if you just sort of model the yield curve. So we're a little further through the loan beta than we are at the deposit beta, but not much. And there's certainly much more room to go in terms of loan yields from here. Just given kind of about just over 10% of the portfolio in auto, that turns pretty quick, just over two years. So going to get the benefit of that repricing and some at delays but impactful beta there.And then obviously, the sort of the longer-dated loan book likewise is seeing a nice reset in terms of rates, and it's about a benefit for us over the coming quarters as well.Ken Usdin Okay. Thanks, Zach. Operator Next question comes from Jon Arfstrom with RBC. Please state your question.Jon Arfstrom Thanks. Good morning, everyone. A few questions here. Zach, on Slide 14, that green line on the bottom, the last time you said, it took a couple of quarters for deposit cost to roll over after the Fed stop. If we're done in May, do you think that relationship holds? Does it -- is it two quarters and deposit costs stopped going up? Is that fair?Zach Wasserman That's generally the expectation we've got, John, yes, based on just the prior basis.Obviously, the [indiscernible], it could be a kind of function of the pace with which rates might begin to decline and also what the kind of economic environment, hence, the loan growth environment across the industry that would affect the competitive environment of deposits. So that will clearly play into it. But generally, our planning assumption is, as you know, which is very much in keeping with what we've seen, not only in the last year's cycle, but in multiple recycles for that.Jon Arfstrom Okay. Fair enough. Steve or Rich, maybe for one of you. You used the term in the deck rigorous client selection for commercial real estate. Can you talk a little bit more about that, what you go through? Help us understand the type of work you do and do you think this is different than what your peers are doing?Rich Pohle I really can't speak to what our peers are doing, but I can tell you that we, for four years now, have developed a process of really fine-tuning who we do business with in this space.As you know, real estate cycles and you have to be able to depend on who you're doing business with to support the projects. And so we really narrowed the funnel around the types of the sponsors that we work with. And we said -- we cure them. We look at their -- just how long they've been in business. We look at their financial wherewithal. We look at their liquidity. And more importantly, we look at how they've behaved in past cycles. And we cure them and are curing how much we'll have out to any particular sponsor how [indiscernible] single project we will have to them and other metrics associated with that. So we -- right now, we are focused on serving the core and that has served us well going forward.Steve Steinour Jon, we're always disciplined in our credit.And I think that's going to prove to be the case as we come through the cycle. Obviously, pleased with where we are at the moment. So we'll see. But I can tell you, especially in [indiscernible] where we had enormous challenges in '08-'09 we have sustained a discipline here since that time. And Rich has been a big part a bit along with that, our lending fees.Jon Arfstrom Good. One more for you, Steve. I know this seems like a softball, but if not, I'm genuinely curious. But what surprised you the most over the past six weeks as you manage through some of this disruption?Steve Steinour The speed of the one on the banks was a surprise, Jon, faster than that we've seen that I can ever recall. And I think, as a consequence, it lead -- the regulators and others, maybe a little behind what they would become they didn't expected either.And that's why I think it's a couple of weeks to go as we be resolved and signature as well. Normally, there's more front-end planning. They have a chance to line things up. This turned into a little bit more of a scramble. Having said that, I thought the reaction that something from treasury and as just -- it was just outstanding timing and fully appropriate.Jon Arfstrom Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos with JP Morgan Chase. Please state your question.Steven Alexopoulos Hi, everybody. Steve Steinour Hi, Steven. Steven Alexopoulos I want to start. So on the net interest income, outlook, which has taken down a bit. Given everything is actually detailed on the swaps and the forward curve, as of right now, where do you see yourself trending within that?Is there a bias either to the upside or downside within that range right now?Zach Wasserman When we set these ranges, we try to set them with our general expectation to be the right at the midpoint. So that's kind of the baseline expectation. I think kind of what -- the puts and takes that would take you to the high and the low end codes volume on one hand just sort of the shape of the yield curve and the competitive drive on the other hand. So it's hard to generalize, but we feel quite good about landing in that range at this point, and that’s what we're driving for.Steven Alexopoulos Got it. And is the way we should think about it, so if we're at the low end, say, of the NII range, should then we should be at the low end of the expense guidance?Should we just connect those 2?Zach Wasserman Generally speaking, that is the way we think about it. We throttled the expense growth based on where the revenue trajectory is going. And that's why we try to have a really disciplined forecasting process with as we've said, multiple economics in there so we try to do that. Obviously, the expense level takes some time to pull. And so you need to have a good line of sight to where that's going and it's possible if there's a rapid move but a surprising movement, but that's not possible at given short time period, but over the longer term, yes.Steven Alexopoulos Got it. Okay. So maybe just one last one for Steve. Just following up on your response just now to Jon's question, given the speed at which deposits went out, Silicon Valley Bank, when you look at that, do you view that from a distance as a unique one-off event?Or are there lessons that you're now applying the way you think about managing capital risk, liquidity that even a stable regional bank like yourself will change potentially fairly materially than the aftermath of what we just saw? Thanks. Steve Steinour Steve, I think there are always lessons learned. But the business model is of SVB and Signature were so different from us and other regional banks, but particularly from us. The concentrations of the uninsured deposit level of 95%, just in retrospect, it seems rather clear that the liquidity risk was very, very different and a huge miss combined with their asset liability. In terms of lessons for us, even that much more aware of liquidity. We've always seen this as a prime risk. We've always had good back up, and we've been very granular and advantaged to have that best-in-class uninsured to total deposit ratio.But we'll probably be even more cautious, not probably, we will be even more cautious given the speed at which things move as we go forward. Having said all that, we're in a very strong position today. We expect to grow deposits as we continue through the year. And so it's like extra vigilance. We may give some policy adjustments to reinforce and strengthen further, but that will be of a minor nature, I don't think it will impact our performance.Steven Alexopoulos Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Zach Wasserman Thank you. Operator And ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Steinour for closing remarks.Steve Steinour So thank you very much for joining us today.And as you've heard, we're operating from a position of strength with the foundation that's been built over a long period of time. We're very, very focused on continued growth and intend to be opportunistic. We're confident in our ability to continue creating value for shareholders. And as a reminder, the Board executives and our colleagues are a top 10 shareholder collectively, reflecting our strong alignment with our shareholders. So thank you for your support and interest in Huntington. Have a great day.Operator Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.]"

""Approval of our targets is an important step in our ongoing journey to address climate change and is a testament to our fierce commitment to corporate climate leadership.""MGM Resorts received validation for the following goals:Reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 50% by 2030, which is in line with a 1.5°C trajectoryReduce absolute scope 3 GHG emissions from purchased goods and services, fuel-and energy-related activities, waste generated in operations, and employee commuting by 30%Recognizing that emissions extend to the global value chain, MGM Resorts set a scope 3 emissions reduction target, setting a precedent for an industry in which most emissions come from the value chain, including purchased goods and services.For the combined scope 1 and 2 target, the Company aims to substantially reduce scope 2 emissions associated with electricity use in the U.S by pursuing a separate but related goal to source 100% renewable electricity in the U.S. by 2030. The MGM Resorts Mega Solar Array provides up to 90% of daytime electricity use at Las Vegas Strip resorts and approximately 30% of total Las Vegas resort electricity use (day and night). For the scope 3 target, progress toward the goal will be activated by applying multiple levers across significant categories, with an emphasis on reducing embodied emissions in purchased goods and services, particularly those related to food.Story continuesMGM Resorts strives to lead the hospitality industry in its response to a changing climate with transparency, accountability and actions informed by the latest climate science. In 2022, CDP placed MGM Resorts on its A-List for climate change and water security, making it one of only 57 companies worldwide to achieve this recognition.

Indeed, such companies are often known as blue-chip stocks that will never go out of style.There are many factors that render these timeless blue-chip stocks largely impervious to competition. For one, the tremendous power of their brands and the high barriers to entry in their sectors, provide pricing power. Accordingly, these companies are less-exposed to increased competition, and can enjoy higher profitability for longer.However, there are some downsides to owning blue-chip stocks. Notably, these companies are unlikely to surge 10- or 20-times over the span of a few years. That’s because these companies are already at scale, and tend to grow less-quickly.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNevertheless, for older and more conservative investors, reliable blue-chip stocks should constitute the lion’s share of a given portfolio. I think the following three names are great candidates to be included, for investors seeking timeless exposure to blue-chip stocks.MGMMGM Resorts$44.75VWAGYVolkswagen$16.67FSLRFirst Solar$209.90MGM Resorts (MGM)A photo of the MGM logo on the MGM casino building.Source: Michael Neil Thomas / Shutterstock.comMGM (NYSE:MGM) is extremely well-leveraged to Las Vegas’ gambling boom, owning no fewer than 14 casinos in Sin City. Showing how well Las Vegas is performing, the revenue of Nevada’s casinos jumped 11.2% year-over-year to $1.24 billion. February was the 24th straight month that the winnings of the state’s casinos came in over $1 billion.Given MGM’s 50% stake in BetMGM, one of the leading online sports betting companies, MGM is also well-positioned to benefit tremendously from the massive growth of sports betting. Sports betting gross gaming revenue soared almost 75% to $7.5 billion in 2022. Thus, with more states poised to legalize online sports betting, the sector’s boom should continue for many years.Story continuesMGM has a powerful brand in Las Vegas, as it owns many famous casinos on the city’s iconic Strip, including Bellagio, MGM Grand, and Luxor. Moreover, BetMGM has become a compelling brand in the online sports betting space. And there are very high barriers to competition on both fronts, as it takes a tremendous amount of money to acquire casinos on the Strip, or build a widely-used sports betting app.Volkswagen (VWAGY)the Volkswagen logo displayed on the grille of a carSource: Helmut Seisenberger / Shutterstock.comAs the world’s second-most famous automaker, Volkswagen (OTC:VWAGY) has a compelling brand. Notably, the automaker’s brand looks poised to strengthen as electric vehicles reign supreme. That’s because the automaker has one of the world’s top EV makers, with its EV sales climbing 24% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2022.Meanwhile, new-vehicle registrations in Europe, where Volkswagen is based, jumped 29% year-over-year last month, showing that the continent’s auto market remains strong. Given Europe’s status as one of the world’s wealthiest geographies, the continent’s auto market should grow significantly for the foreseeable future.In light of Volkswagen’s long history of making quality cars and the popularity of its electric vehicles, it will be challenging for competitors to de-throne Volkswagen from its perch near the top of the world’s automakers.Despite these strengths, VWAGY stock has a meager forward price-earnings ratio of just 5.2-times.First Solar (FSLR)First Solar logo on smartphone in front of computer screen with graphs. FSLR stockSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comFirst Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) has become one of the world’s leading makers of solar panels, and the company has established fruitful relationships with many extensive utilities that are beginning to rely on solar to a larger extent. In other words, First Solar has a very strong brand in the minds of utility executives.Another factor making FSLR one of the most reliable blue-chip stocks to buy is its head start in manufacturing solar panels in the U.S. First Solar already has a major solar panel factory in Ohio. The company is also building another plant, while expanding its existing factory. Those factories will allow the company to benefit from the new extensive U.S. tax credits for U.S.-made solar panels.Showing how robust First Solar’s business is becoming worldwide, and the extent to which solar is proliferating, First Solar recently won government grants from India for its 3.4-gigawatt plant in that nation. First Solar also obtained a vast 1.8-gigawatt deal from French company EDF Renewables last month.As of the date of publication, Larry Ramer owned shares of MGM.

In the last reported quarter, the company reported a negative earnings surprise of 16.9%.The Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 43 cents per share, indicating an improvement of 76.4% from a loss of $1.82 reported in the year-ago quarter. For revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $1.76 billion. The projection suggests an improvement from $521.9 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Let's find out how things have shaped up in the quarter under review.Factors at PlayNorwegian Cruise’s first-quarter results are likely to reflect benefits of improving booking trends, fleet expansion efforts and robust passenger ticket revenues. Earlier, the company had said that the cumulative booked position for 2023 is higher than the 2019 reported levels.Also, the removal of COVID testing requirements from countries like Canada, Bermuda, Greece and South America have been aiding the company. For first-quarter 2023, our model predicts passenger ticket, and onboard and other revenues to increase 353.6% and 10.6% year over year to $1,553.3 million and $198.6 million, respectively.However, high costs are likely to have hurt the bottom line in the quarter to be reported. We expect total cruise operating expenses to increase 72.6% year over year to $1,269.3 million. In fourth-quarter 2022, NCLH’s performance was negatively impacted by the absence of premium-priced Baltic itineraries and the trend is likely to have continued in first-quarter 2023.Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.45 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +11.5%.Revenues are expected to be $11.35 billion, up 3.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.5% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate.

Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss.

Until now, it has been based on five British and Norwegian North Sea crudes.The companies that run the North Sea crude streams, known as the operator, issue planned cargo loading lists which the industry monitors as an indication of supply. June programmes for the five North Sea crudes were issued this week.However, Platts told customers in September that U.S. Gulf Coast terminals may not be able to provide month-ahead loading schedules. It said terminals should make clear their typical monthly allotment of slots for potential cargoes, and inform the market promptly of any planned maintenance or major disruptions.The company told Reuters on Thursday it didn't see any problems around this given that the market has been preparing for the changes for months and participants had told Platts they were comfortable with the process.""We see no reason for issues,"" said Joel Hanley, global director, crude and fuel oil, at S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights.""With the increasing real-time tools in ship tracking, supply chains and flow data and the transparency that price assessments bring, we believe the marketplace has more information about supplies and flows than it ever has before.""Oil traders said there is no WTI Midland programme because the U.S. crude does not have a single operator and several terminals can supply cargoes. Platts will accept 11 U.S. Gulf Coast terminals as supply points for WTI Midland.Story continuesTrading veterans Adi Imsirovic and Kurt Chapman wrote last month that ""generally, U.S. Gulf terminals do not have a right to publish loading dates"" and can only do so if instructed by the cargo owners.A North Sea trader said the lack of a WTI Midland loading programme could make trading more difficult although he expected some information on loading dates to become available.Potential volumes of WTI Midland coming to Europe are large according to tanker-tracking data. Shipments to Europe hit 1.25 million barrels per day in March, according to Kpler, greater than the other five dated Brent grades combined.Thomson Reuters competes with S&amp;P Global Platts in providing news and data about the oil market.(Reporting by Alex Lawler; Additional reporting by Rowena Edwards; Editing by Kirsten Donovan)]"

Last year at this time, a barrel of U.S. crude was trading above $100, about 30% higher than today.A month after the invasion of Ukraine began Exxon said that it would pull out of Russia, where it valued its operations in excess of $4 billion, and cut off new investment in the country. In October, the company said its operations had been expropriated by Moscow after it had tried to wind them down in an orderly fashion,The company boosted production in Guyana by 40% since then, which “more than offset our divestments in the expropriation of one which we no longer account for but which importantly remains part of global supply,” said Chairman and CEO Darren Woods on Friday.Exxon earned a record $11.43 billion, or $2.79 per share, for the three months ended March 31. Per-share adjusted earning were $2.83, topping Wall Street projections of $2.65, and it more than twice the $5.48 billion, or $1.28 per share, it earned during the first quarter last year.Exxon does not adjust its reported results based on one-time events such as asset sales.Revenue for the Irving, Texas-based company was $86.56 billion, down from $90.5 billion a year earlier, and just shy of analyst expectations.Net production was 3.8 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, up nearly 160,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day compared with the year-ago period. Excluding divestments, entitlements and the Sakhalin-1 expropriation, net production climbed almost 300,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day driven by projects in Guyana and the Permian.Story continuesThe price for a barrel of benchmark U.S. crude has fallen more than 6% this year, however, and it's fallen 29% over the past 12 months. Central banks have been attempting to cool their respective economies because of elevated inflation and evidence of those maneuvers have begun to appear.The U.S. reported this week that its economy slowed sharply from January through March, decelerating to just a 1.1% annual pace as higher interest rates hammered the housing market and businesses reduced their inventories.U.S. benchmark crude oil was at $75.25 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange on Friday, while brent crude, the international standard, was at $78.74 per barrel.Chevron Corp., based in San Ramon, California, posted a profit of $6.57 billion. Its adjusted earnings totaled $3.55 per share, while revenue came in at $50.79 billion.The company refining operations churned out nearly $1 billion in profits, more than doubling earns from a year ago in that division.Shares of Exxon Mobil Corp. rose more than 2% at the opening bell while shares of Chevron rose less than 1%.]"

Chevron said it conducts business in compliance with all laws, regulations and a sanctions framework provided by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).Valero Energy Corp also has received cargoes from Chevron with tanker Caribbean Voyager discharging about 500,000 barrels at its 340,000-bpd St. Charles, Louisiana, refinery on Thursday.The top independent refiner did not immediately respond to a request for comment, however, Gary Simmons, its chief commercial officer, said in an earnings call on Thursday that Venezuelan production is forecast to grow and help ease tight supplies of heavy sour crude oil.Chevron has sent Venezuelan crude to its 369,000-bpd Pascagoula, Mississippi, refinery and this month shipped a cargo to a Bahamas oil-storage terminal, PDVSA's schedules showed.(Reporting by Arathy Somasekhar and Marianna Parraga in Houston; Editing by Marguerita Choy)]"

That is our ultimate goal"", Shi Chao, director of the intelligence department at the Hongliulin mine, said during a media tour this week.The nearby Xiaobaodang mine, also owned by Shaanxi Coal, has cut its underground staff by 42%.The project in China comes after a more than decade-long push by top global miners like Rio Tinto and BHP Group to add automation to improve safety, cut costs and better attract workers.Coal mines in China, which produced more than half the world's coal last year, are among the deadliest, with accidents causing almost 250 deaths in 2022, a six-year high.China's National Energy Administration is urging miners to accelerate their adoption of ""smart mining"" technology in a bid to improve safety and efficiency as coal output grows with Beijing's efforts to bolster energy security even as it expands its use of renewable sources.""Mining is a highly regulated industry - the regulator has a very strong voice in this, especially in China,"" said Xu Jun, chief technology officer of Huawei's mines team during the mine tour in China's northwestern Shaanxi province.Story continuesThe miner declined to comment on cost savings, but use of 5G-enabled automated mining systems from China Mobile and ZTE in the nearby Dahaize coal mine reduced coal costs by 12 yuan per tonne ($1.84) and labour costs by 20 million yuan ($2.89 million) per year, according to a 2021 study by GSMA, a global smart mobile networks industry association.Huawei says the Hongliulin mine spent about 200 million yuan on installing intelligent mining.More than 1,000 Chinese coal faces with total production capacity of 620 million tonnes per year now use smart technology, the National Energy Administration said this month, accounting for around 14% of last year's output.The market could be worth 600 billion yuan, Xinda Securities estimated last year, based on demand from 3,000 mines.(Reporting by Andrew Hayley; additional reporting by Amy Lv in Beijing and Muyu Xu in Singapore; Editing by Jamie Freed)]"

Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki has said securities firms must make every effort to deal carefully with their customers, and the country’s financial regulator has said brokerages must give thorough explanations to affected clients.Switzerland’s rescue last month of Credit Suisse wiped out the AT1 bonds issued by the bank, leaving global investors with about $17 billion in losses. The Japanese brokerage, one of two joint ventures of MUFG and Morgan Stanley, isn’t able to say yet if there were any improper sales cases, according to Yamamoto. It plans to check whether clients understood the risks of their purchases through follow-up discussions with them over coming days, he said.Story continues“I don’t think there was any problem in sales practices because we understand that our employees have followed the rules, offering customers explanations,” Yamamoto said. “However, we certainly find it necessary to confirm details with each client.”MUFG’s approach on the AT1 sales contrasts with several major financial firms in Asia. Nomura Holdings Inc. said this week it decided against selling these bonds to individual retail clients because they could become worthless under some conditions, while United Overseas Bank Ltd. in Singapore said it advised clients to get out of this Credit Suisse debt last year.Doubling ProfitYamamoto said the company intends to “firmly proceed” with its business of proposing portfolios to clients through its wealth management and business advisory services. “We of course are taking the latest incident seriously and will consider making changes to upgrade our services if we find anything that needs reviewing,” he added.Net income at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities more than doubled to 13 billion yen in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago, according to a statement, the best performance in five years.--With assistance from Taiga Uranaka.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekA Tax Loophole Makes EV Leasing a No-Brainer in the USGood Luck Paying for Those $10,000 Obesity Drugs Everyone’s Talking AboutAt Charles Schwab, Being a Big Bank Has Become a Big ProblemMusk Bets the House of Tesla on Low Prices and Razor-Thin MarginsBiden Sparks a $2 Trillion Arms Race Over Chips, Green Subsidies©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

As Wall Street debates the cause of First Republic’s (FRC) troubles, one analyst blames the nation’s top financial regulators. Fed Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen were “advocates of the strategy called ‘go big at the Fed’,” Chris Whalen, Whalen Global Advisors Chairman tells Yahoo Finance.“After 2018…we had a big problem in the money markets, so I think Chairman Powell…panicked in Washington, and they decided to provide more reserves.”As the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the central bank acted again, bringing the Fed’s balance sheet to nearly $9 trillion. “What they did, in essence, was throw a lot of money at a perceived problem, but they’ve created a real problem now, which is that interest rates have risen,” Whalen says.""The Fed has created a huge market risk, so these outliers like Silicon Valley, First Republic, have tipped over in a difficult funding market.”In his full interview, Whalen spoke with Brad Smith and Julie Hyman about the issues First Republic (FRC) is facing.Key Video Moments00:00:05: Powell and Yellen's strategy00:01:10: Huge market risk00:01:35: Unrealized losses on balance sheetsVideo Transcript- Why is it Jay and Secretary Yellen's fault?CHRIS WHALEN: Well, particularly, Chairman Powell, but also, I think, Secretary Yellen, were advocates of a strategy that's called go big at the Fed. After 2018, you recall at the end of the year, we had a big problem in the money markets. And so I think Chairman Powell and some of his colleagues panicked in Washington, and they decided to provide more reserves. They did so in 2019. And then we had COVID, and they even went bigger.And they expanded the Fed's balance sheet to almost $9 trillion. So what they did, in essence, was throw a lot of money at a perceived problem, but they've created a real problem now, which is that interest rates have risen. All the paper that was originated in 2020 and '21 is now trading 15, 20 points below the price where it was issued. And the banks are facing huge losses. Also other investors-- bond investors, REITs, all sorts of people that own these high-quality triple-A rated securities-- we're talking about treasuries, Ginnies, Fannies, Freddies, right-- which are supposed to be low-risk, but the Fed has created huge market risk. And so these outliers, like Silicon Valley, First Republic, have tipped over in a difficult funding market. And even JP, even Bank of America, you can see how their cost of funds is rising. It's very rapidly year over year.Story continues- Their cost of funds is rising, Chris. Hey, it's Julie. It's good to see you.CHRIS WHALEN: Hey.- Their cost of funds is rising. However, the whole issue of unrealized losses sitting on their balance sheets, like that in and of itself, isn't that much less of an issue, if it isn't-- isn't it even almost a moot point at the biggest banks-- at everybody besides the banks that seem the most distressed? I mean, those banks don't have to do anything with that stuff, right?CHRIS WHALEN: No. You see, that's the issue. In a way, yes, it's an optics problem. So back at the end of the third quarter last year, it was horrible. It was almost a trillion dollars in market-to-market losses on available for sale, and also held to maturity securities. But the problem, Julie, is that we originated $25 trillion for the securities in '21 and '21, of all descriptions. That paper has very low cash flow. So if I'm holding Ginnie Mae II's and my cost of funds is now 5, I'm losing money. OK? And so the embedded cash flow loss is the problem.And that's why you've seen some banks actually taking assets to the curb, taking the loss on a 2% or 3% asset, right? So they can go by a 6% or a 7%. And the whole industry is going to have to do this, Julie. They have no choice.]"

(NYSE: FE) today reported first quarter 2023 GAAP earnings of $292 million, or $0.51 per basic and diluted share, on revenue of $3.2 billion. In the first quarter of 2022, the company reported GAAP earnings of $288 million, or $0.51 per basic share of common stock ($0.50 diluted), on revenue of $3.0 billion. Results for both periods include the special items listed below.FirstEnergy Corp.

Operating (non-GAAP) earnings in the first quarter of 2022 were also $0.60 per share.Significant earnings drivers in the first quarter of 2023 include the company's long-term regulated investment strategies, lower operating expenses and higher investment income. These were primarily offset by the impact of mild winter temperatures, which negatively impacted usage by $0.12 per share compared to the first quarter of 2022, and lower pension credits.""Despite record-high temperatures across our footprint this winter, we're off to a good start in 2023 as we continue positioning FirstEnergy for greater resiliency and growth by strengthening our financial position, enhancing our operations and optimizing the customer experience,"" said John W. Somerhalder II, FirstEnergy board chair, interim president and chief executive officer. ""So far this year, we've made progress on those goals with numerous regulatory filings, announcing the sale of an additional interest in our FirstEnergy Transmission business and driving for performance excellence in operations.

Under his leadership, I'm confident FirstEnergy will continue advancing these strategies to create long-term value for our investors, customers, employees and communities.""Story continuesFirstEnergy updated its full-year 2023 GAAP earnings forecast to $1,350 million to $1,465 million, or $2.35 to $2.55 per share based on 574 million shares outstanding, and affirmed its operating (non-GAAP) guidance range of $2.44 to $2.64 per share. In addition, the company is providing a guidance range of $230 million to $285 million, or $0.40 to $0.50 per share for the second quarter of 2023, based on 573 million shares outstanding.The company affirmed its long-term, 6% to 8% targeted annual operating earnings per share growth rate, which is based off the previous year's operating earnings guidance midpoint.Segment ResultsIn the Regulated Distribution business, extremely mild temperatures across the company's service area drove a $0.12 per share decrease in customer usage compared to the first quarter of 2022. Operating results were also impacted by higher interest expense and lower pension credits, partially offset by higher revenue related to investment programs, stronger weather-adjusted customer demand and lower operating expenses. Total distribution deliveries decreased 5.3% compared to the first quarter of 2022 due to lower weather-related usage in the residential and commercial sectors and nearly flat industrial sales. Residential and commercial sales decreased 8.4% and 7.1%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2022, while sales to industrial customers decreased less than 1%. On a weather-adjusted basis, residential sales increased more than 5%, while commercial deliveries increased 1.5% over the period.In the Regulated Transmission business, first quarter 2023 operating results benefited from the company's ongoing Energizing the Future investment program, offset by the impact of the FirstEnergy Transmission 19.9% minority interest sale that closed on May 31, 2022. During the first quarter of 2023, the company made nearly $350 million in regulated transmission investments, a 60% increase compared to the same period of 2022.In Corporate/Other, first quarter 2023 operating results improved as compared to the first quarter of 2022 due to a higher earnings contribution from the company's legacy investment in Signal Peak and lower interest expense from holding company debt redemptions during 2022. Consolidated GAAP Earnings Per Share (EPS) to Operating (Non-GAAP) EPS* ReconciliationFirst Quarter2023 Estimates20232022Full YearEarnings Attributable to FirstEnergy Corp.(GAAP) - $M$292$288$1,350 - $1,465Basic EPS (GAAP)$0.51$0.51$2.35 - $2.55Excluding Special Items*:Regulatory charges0.010.010.01FE Forward cost to achieve0.05—0.05Investigation and other related costs0.030.010.03Debt-related costs—0.06—Strategic transaction costs—0.01—Total Special Items*0.090.090.09Operating EPS (Non-GAAP)$0.60$0.60$2.44 – $2.64Per share amounts for the special items above are based on the after-tax effect of each item divided by the number of shares outstanding for the period. The current and deferred income tax effect was calculated by applying the subsidiaries' statutory tax rate to the pre-tax amount if deductible/taxable. The income tax rate ranges from 21% to 29%. Basic EPS (GAAP) and Operating EPS (Non-GAAP) is based on 572 million shares for the First Quarter 2023, 573 million shares for the Second Quarter 2023, 574 million shares for Full Year 2023, and 570 million shares for the First Quarter 2022.   Non-GAAP financial measures * Operating earnings (loss) excludes ""special items"" as described below, and is a non-GAAP financial measure. Special items represent charges incurred or benefits realized that management believes are not indicative of, or may obscure trends useful in evaluating the Company's ongoing core activities and results of operations or otherwise warrant separate classification. Special items are not necessarily non-recurring. Management cannot estimate on a forward-looking basis the impact of these items in the context of long-term annual operating EPS growth rate projections because these items, which could be significant, are difficult to predict and may be highly variable. Consequently, the Company is unable to reconcile long-term annual operating EPS growth projections to a GAAP measure without unreasonable effort. Management uses Operating earnings (loss) and Operating earnings (loss) per share to evaluate the Company's performance and manage its operations and frequently references these non-GAAP financial measures in its decision making, using them to facilitate historical and ongoing performance comparisons. Additionally, management uses Operating earnings (loss) per share by segment to further evaluate the Company's performance by segment and references this non-GAAP financial measure in its decision making. Operating earnings (loss) per share and Operating earnings (loss) per share for each segment is calculated by dividing Operating earnings (loss), which excludes special items as discussed herein, for the periods presented by the number of shares outstanding. Basic EPS (GAAP) and Operating EPS (Non-GAAP), as well as Basic EPS (GAAP) and Operating EPS (Non-GAAP) for each segment, are based on 570 million shares for the first quarter 2022, 571 million shares for the full year 2022, 572 million shares for the first quarter 2023, 573 million shares for the second quarter 2023 and 574 million shares for the full year 2023. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures of Operating earnings (loss) and Operating earnings (loss) per share, and Operating earnings (loss) per share by segment provide consistent and comparable measures of performance of its businesses on an ongoing basis. Management also believes that such measures are useful to shareholders and other interested parties to understand performance trends and evaluate the Company against its peer group by presenting period-over-period operating results without the effect of certain charges or benefits that may not be consistent or comparable across periods or across the Company's peer group. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures are intended to complement, and are not considered as alternatives to, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Also, the non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, FirstEnergy has provided, where possible without unreasonable effort, quantitative reconciliations within this presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.Investor Materials and TeleconferenceFirstEnergy's Strategic and Financial Highlights presentation is posted on the company's Investor Information website – www.firstenergycorp.com/ir.

Flowserve’s Manufacturing-General Industrial Industry is in the top 27% of over 250 Zacks Industries.As a leading manufacturer and aftermarket service provider of comprehensive flow control systems, Flowserve is well positioned to benefit from a strong business environment with stellar top and bottom line growth expected.Q1 Preview: Flowserve’s first-quarter earnings are expected to soar 271% year over year at $0.26 per share compared to EPS of $0.07 in Q1 2022.

More impressive, annual earnings are projected to climb 53% this year at $1.68 per share compared to EPS of $1.10 in 2022. Plus, fiscal 2024 earnings are expected to jump another 26%.

74,17221422-caff-38f3-b8e8-aa9aaddfd78d,FLS,2023-04-28,Xylem (XYL) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xylem-xyl-earnings-expected-grow-140202657.html,1682604122,STORY,"['FLS', 'XYL']","[Xylem (XYL) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 4. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis water and wastewater treatment company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.62 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +31.9%.Revenues are expected to be $1.34 billion, up 5.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.33% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Xylem?For Xylem, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.89%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Xylem will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Xylem would post earnings of $0.80 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.92, delivering a surprise of +15%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Xylem appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Manufacturing - General Industrial industry, Flowserve (FLS), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.26 per share for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +271.4%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $899.73 million, up 9.6% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Flowserve has been revised 1.5% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 3.71%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), suggests that Flowserve will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

75,d58a2d81-f419-3e78-92b5-a9ee66ecc412,FLS,2023-04-28,4 Stocks to Buy as Durable Goods Orders Rebound in March,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-buy-durable-goods-120112122.html,1682596872,STORY,"['PH', 'FLS', 'IR', 'HUBB']","[Orders for U.S.-made factory goods rebounded in March after two straight months of decline. While soaring commodity prices have made spending difficult for consumers, higher interest rates are making raw materials expensive. However, the latest report from the Census Bureau comes as inflation is showing signs of easing lately.The manufacturing sector has been struggling amid price pressures but higher orders for transportation equipment helped boost orders for durable goods in March. Given this scenario, stocks like Hubbell Incorporated HUBB, Parker-Hannifin Corporation PH, Ingersoll Rand Inc. IR and Flowserve Corporation FLS are expected to benefit in the near term.Durable Goods Order JumpOn Apr 26, the Census Bureau said that orders for goods made in U.S. factories jumped a solid 3.2% in March or $8.6 billion, surpassing estimates of a 0.8% increase. The rebound follows a 1.2% decline in February.Excluding defense, orders for new goods increased 3.5% in March. The jump in March was led by a solid increase in orders for transportation equipment.Orders for transportation equipment also bounced back after monthly declines in January and February. Transportation equipment orders rose $8.1 billion or 9.1% to $97.4 billion.Excluding transportation, orders for durable goods rose 0.3% in March.Shipments of manufactured durable goods grew 1.1%, or $2.9 billion, in March to reach $277 billion. This follows a 0.8% decline in February.New orders for nondefense capital goods jumped $8.4 billion or 10.4% to $89.6 billion in March. Shipments for nondefense goods climbed $3 billion, or 3.6% to $85.8 billion.The manufacturing sector has been struggling lately amid inflationary pressures. Production at U.S. factories has been declining for the past few months. However, signs of a rebound can finally be seen. The report came days after the Fed said that industrial production rose 0.4% in March, surpassing estimates of an increase of 0.2%. Year over year, industrial production grew 0.5% in March.Story continuesAlso, capacity utilization, which indicates overall demand and growth in the economy, rose 0.2% to 79.8% in March, surpassing estimates of 79.1%.The rebound in both industrial production and new orders for durable goods comes as inflation showed signs of easing in February.The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, increased 0.3% in February, beating analysts’ expectations of a rise of 0.4% and but coming in lower than January’s jump of 0.5%On a year-over-year basis, PCE increased 4.6% in February, slightly lower than the January level. The decline definitely is helping the manufacturing sector as evident from the solid jump in orders for durable goods in March.Our ChoicesGiven this scenario, it will be prudent to invest in stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank that are poised to gain from the solid durable goods orders. We narrowed down our search to four such stocks. Each of these stocks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Hubbell Incorporated is engaged in the design, manufacture and sale of electrical and electronic products to commercial, industrial, utility and telecommunications markets. HUBB’s products include plugs, receptacles, connectors, lighting fixtures, high voltage test and measurement equipment, and voice and data signal processing components.Hubbell Incorporated’s expected earnings growth for the current year is 6.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.4% over the last 60 days. HUBB carries a Zacks Rank #2.Parker-Hannifin Corporation is a global diversified manufacturer of motion &amp; control technologies and systems. PH provides precision-engineered solutions for a wide variety of mobile, industrial and aerospace markets.Parker-Hannifin Corporation’s expected earnings growth for the current year is 5.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.3% over the past 60 days. PH presently has a Zacks Rank #2.Ingersoll Rand Inc. is a global industrial company, with expertise in industrial and mission-critical flow creation technologies.

Against a backdrop of a looming recession, most financial commentators are talking up the prospect of more uncertainty ahead.But not everyone. In fact, the strategy team at Bank of America believes there are plenty of reasons for owning stocks right now. Market sentiment is resolutely bearish, and a recession is practically accepted by everyone – both offering a chance for a contrarian take. And there’s trillions in ‘dry powder’ waiting to enter the market, while there’s also the prospect of the Fed taking a step back from its rate-hiking activities.BofA also has an idea where the best opportunities are right now. “In what feels like a conviction-less market, we have high conviction in upside risk cyclical sectors within the S&amp;P 500 this quarter,” said team leader Savita Subramanian.So, let’s take a look at a couple of names that fit such a description. We opened the TipRanks database and got the lowdown on two stocks that share a particular set of attributes: cyclical stocks by nature, part of the S&amp;P 500, and both boasting a Strong Buy consensus rating. Here are the details.Constellation Brands (STZ)We’ll start with Constellation Brands, a giant of the consumer-packaged goods segment. The alcoholic beverage leader oversees a drinks portfolio with many household names amongst the 100+ brands. From Corona, Modelo Especial and Negra Modelo on the imported beers list to spirits including Svedka vodka, High West Whiskey and Casa Noble Tequila to a wine collection including Robert Mondavi, the Prisoner Wine Company and Ruffino. Aside from being the U.S.’s biggest beer importer by sales, Constellation also boasts of cannabis and healthcare investments.Investors seemed sanguine about the company’s latest financial statement, for F4Q23, despite the report not hitting all the right notes. Revenue hit $2 billion, coming in $20 million below expectations although the company highlighted the beer business’s outperformance which showed depletion growth of over 6% with Modelo Especial and Corona Extra leading the way. At the other end of the scale, EPS of $1.98 fared better than the $1.84 forecast.Story continuesFor the year ahead, the company sees EPS hitting the range between $11.70-$12.00, at the midpoint above consensus at $11.80. Constellation also announced that the quarterly dividend would rise by 11.3% to $0.89 from $0.80 per share. The payout currently yields 1.43%.Assessing Constellation’s prospects, RBC analyst Nik Modi thinks the latest financial results should go some way toward assuaging prior worries.“This quarter’s performance and guidance should ease some investor concerns regarding the underlying health of Constellation’s beer business,” the 5-star analyst writes. “Better-than-expected depletions (despite the poor weather in CA) and initial FY’24 guidance that was in line with management’s previous commentary should also give the bulls something to be encouraged by… Mgmt. called out STZ has been doing extremely well in shelf reset situations with their portfolio representing more than 80% of the growth in beer. Distribution gains (on and off premise) should support STZ growth in markets once weather trends normalize.”Accordingly, Modi rates STZ shares an Outperform (i.e., Buy), while his $295 price target implies 29% upside potential from current levels. (To watch Modi’s track record, click here)Most on the Street agree with Modi’s thesis. The stock garners a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 13 Buys vs. 3 Holds. (See STZ stock forecast)PG&amp;E Corporation (PCG)Let’s continue with a big name in the utilities space. PCG is the holding company behind Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company, an electric and gas utility offering services to 16 million people across Northern California. Specializing in energy, utility, power, gas, electricity, solar and sustainability, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric has 5.5 million electric customer accounts and 4.5 million gas customer accounts under its belt. With a workforce numbering roughly ~26,000 employees, it is one of the biggest utility names in the US.That said, the company comes with a loaded history and was forced to go bankrupt in January 2019 following devastating wildfires caused by its equipment. Since then, the company has improved its safety measures, undergone leadership changes, and committed to investing in infrastructure to prevent future disasters.Last month the company submitted to California’s Office of Energy Infrastructure Safety its new WildfireMitigation Plan, whereby it intends on spending $18 billion in wildfire prevention through 2025.It’s the concerted efforts to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past which forms part of Ladenburg Thalmann analyst Paul Fremont’s thesis.“Following the completion of the company’s plan to underground 10,000 miles of its distribution lines, we believe the company will have effectively eliminated its exposure to wildfires,” the analyst explained. “Meanwhile, California has set aside a $20 billion wildfire fund to pay for near term fire exposure. Additionally, the current level of rate base investment supports our forecast of 10% EPS growth through 2025 which is among the highest in the utility sector.”To this end, Fremont rates PCG shares a Buy, while his $20.50 price target suggests the shares will climb 20% higher in the year ahead. (To watch Fremont’s track record, click here)Elsewhere on the Street, the stock garners an additional 5 Buys and one Hold, all coalescing to a Strong Buy consensus rating.

79,e16f3f4d-967c-39c4-a9ef-19b34e2c4031,NWS,2023-04-28,Analysts Estimate News Corp. (NWSA) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-news-corp-nwsa-140202970.html,1682604122.0,STORY,"['NWSA', 'WWE']","[News Corp. (NWSA) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis publishing company whose flagship is The Wall Street Journal is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.06 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -62.5%.Revenues are expected to be $2.4 billion, down 3.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 14.82% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for News Corp.For News Corp.The Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -47.06%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that News Corp. Will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that News Corp. Would post earnings of $0.25 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.14, delivering a surprise of -44%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.News Corp. Doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsWorld Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), another stock in the Zacks Film and Television Production and Distribution industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.41 for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -46.8%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $285.46 million, down 14.4% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for WWE has been revised 4.7% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -4.88%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that WWE will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A Look At Its Intrinsic Value",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/align-technology-inc-nasdaq-algn-110158549.html,1682679718,STORY,['ALGN'],"[Key InsightsUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Align Technology fair value estimate is US$259Align Technology is estimated to be 23% overvalued based on current share price of US$318Our fair value estimate is 25% lower than Align Technology's analyst price target of US$346How far off is Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Align Technology Step By Step Through The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$502.2mUS$670.4mUS$678.3mUS$817.2mUS$1.00bUS$1.11bUS$1.20bUS$1.28bUS$1.34bUS$1.39bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 10.67%Est @ 8.09%Est @ 6.28%Est @ 5.02%Est @ 4.13% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3% US$468US$582US$549US$616US$704US$726US$731US$724US$709US$688(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$6.5bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.4b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.3%– 2.1%) = US$27bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$27b÷ ( 1 + 7.3%)10= US$13bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$20b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$318, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Align Technology as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.885. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Align TechnologyStrengthCurrently debt free.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Significant insider buying over the past 3 months.ThreatRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price exceeding the intrinsic value?

QuoteSegments in DetailIn the first quarter, revenues in the Clear Aligner segment were down 2.5% year over year to $789.8 million. Revenues were unfavorably impacted by lower volumes and lower Average Selling Price (ASP), including a foreign exchange headwind of approximately $29.1 million (or 3.6%) year over year. This was partially offset by higher non-case revenues.Total Clear Aligner shipments during the quarter amounted to 575,395, down 3.9% year over year.Revenues from Imaging Systems &amp; CAD/CAM Services were down 6.2% to $153.3 million in the quarter.

ALGN’s GAAP operating margin for 2022 was 17.2%, while the adjusted operating margin was 21.5%.For 2023, the company expects investments in capital expenditures to exceed $200 million (unchanged). Capital expenditures are primarily related to building construction and improvements and additional manufacturing capacity to support Align Technology’s international expansion as well.For the second quarter of 2023, ALGN anticipates revenues to be in the range of $980 million-$1000 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $946.5 million.Align Technology anticipates its adjusted gross margin to remain flat to slightly rise from the first quarter and the adjusted operating margin to be up by approximately 1 point sequentially.Our TakeAlign Technology exited the first quarter of 2023 with an earnings and revenue beat. The company’s Clear Aligner non-case revenues increased year over year, driven by continued growth from the Invisalign Doctor subscription program and sales of Vivera Retainers. ALGN’s recent launch of the Invisalign Comprehensive three and three product was also well received in the market and holds potential for faster revenue recognition than traditional Invisalign comprehensive products.On the flip side, the year-over-year performance was sluggish. The quarter also witnessed a significant foreign exchange impact.The contraction of both margins is worrisome. Align Technology’s operating expenses reported during the quarter increased due to higher incentive compensations and continued investments in sales and R&amp;D activities. This was partially offset by controlled spending on advertising and marketing as part of ALGN’s efforts to manage costs efficiently.Recently, Align Technology announced a $75 million equity investment in Heartland Dental, a multidisciplinary DSO with GDP and ortho practices across the United States. The collaboration underpins the company’s efforts to accelerate the adoption of digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry.Zacks Rank and Key PicksAlign Technology currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Insulet PODD, Avanos Medical AVNS and Henry Schein HSIC.Insulet, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), reported a fourth-quarter 2022 adjusted EPS of 55 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 129.2%.

To see more such stocks, click 5 Best Staffing Company Stocks To Buy Now.The 2022 stock market crash, rising inflation and the Federal Reserve's flurry of rate hikes are forcing companies to announce massive layoffs to cut costs. As employers cut back on spending, staffing and HR-related services companies were affected. But there’s another side to this picture. Amid layoffs, more and more individuals sign up for workforce and job hunting platforms to find new jobs, ultimately helping staffing companies. Data also shows that a major chunk of the laid off workforce are able to find new jobs pretty soon. Jobs platform company ZipRecruiter recently conducted a survey to see the state of the employees who were laid off between December and January. The survey included about 2,000 people. Results show that almost half of the surveyed individuals are working in new jobs, while another quarter said they already have new job offers in hand.The survey said that people from advertising, auto and transportation sectors were most likely to have received job offers after getting laid off.While major technology companies made headlines earlier this year with huge layoffs, there are companies that are continuing to hire more and more workers. For example, Boeing plans to hire 10,000 workers this year. Chipotle also plans to hire about 15,000 workers. Hiring in industries that were devastated by the pandemic and are in recovery mode remains strong. These areas include restaurants, airlines and hotels.Analysts also believe that once inflation gets under control and the Federal Reserve begins to pause and eventually cut interest rates, companies across the board will hire again, which could help staffing and HR platforms.More and more young people are turning to digital staffing platforms to find jobs, upskill themselves and network. The biggest example is Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s LinkedIn, where growth and engagement are making new records. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s CEO Satya Nadella said the following about LinkedIn during the company’s latest earnings call:Story continuesPeople and companies continue to look to LinkedIn to connect, learn, sell and get hired. We once again saw record engagement among our more than 900 million members.Three members are signing up every second. Over 80% of these members are from outside the United States. And as the members come to the platform to find and share professional knowledge and expertise, newsletter creation was up 10x year-over-year. Skills are the new currency and people are increasingly investing in their skill-building to keep up with their changing roles in industries. We offer more than 20,000 courses in 11 languages and companies are also turning to a skills-based approach in place of degree or pedigree to identify qualified talent, with more than 45% of the hires on LinkedIn explicitly using skills data to fill their roles. Finally, LinkedIn Marketing Solutions continues to be a leader in B2B digital advertising, helping companies deliver the right message to the right audience on a safe and trusted platform.Best Staffing Company Stocks To Buy NowMethodologyFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and their holdings and picked top 12 companies that offer staffing, HR, workforce, payroll and related solutions and services.

The Microsoft Cloud delivered over $28 billion in quarterly revenue, up 22% and 25% in constant currency, demonstrating our continued leadership across the tech stack. We continue to focus on three priorities. First, helping customers use the breadth and depth of the Microsoft Cloud to get the most value out of their digital spend. Second, investing to lead in the new AI wave across our solution areas and expanding our TAM. And third, driving operating leverage, aligning our cost structure with our revenue growth.Now I'll highlight examples of our progress, starting with infrastructure.Azure took share as customers continue to choose our ubiquitous computing fabric from cloud to edge, especially as every application becomes AI-powered. We have the most powerful AI infrastructure and it’s being used by our partner, OpenAI, as well as NVIDIA and leading AI start-ups like Adept and Inflection to train large models.Our Azure OpenAI Service brings together advanced models, including ChatGPT and GPT-4 with the enterprise capabilities of Azure. From Coursera and Grammarly to Mercedes-Benz and Shell, we now have more than 2,500 Azure OpenAI Service customers, up 10x quarter-over-quarter. Just last week, Epic Systems shared that it was using Azure OpenAI Service to integrate the next generation of AI with its industry-leading EHR software.Azure also powers OpenAI API and we are pleased to see brands like Shopify and Snap use the API to integrate OpenAI's models.More broadly, we continue to see the world's largest enterprises migrate key workloads to our cloud. Unilever, for example, went all in on Azure this quarter in one of the largest ever cloud migrations in the consumer goods industry.IKEA Retail, ING Bank, Rabobank, Telstra and Wolverine Worldwide, all use Azure Arc to run Azure services across on-premises, edge and multi-cloud environments. We now have more than 15,000 Azure Arc customers, up over 150% year-over-year. And we are extending our infrastructure to 5G network edge with Azure for Operators. We are the cloud of choice for telcos, and at MWC last month, AT&amp;T, Deutsche Telekom, Singtel and Telefonica all shared how they are using our infrastructure to modernize and monetize their networks.Now on to data.Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comOur Intelligent Data Platform brings together databases, analytics and governance, so organizations can spend more time creating value and less time integrating their data estate. Cosmos DB is the go-to database, powering the world's most demanding workloads at any scale. OpenAI relies on Cosmos DB to dynamically scale their ChatGPT service, one of the fastest-growing consumer apps ever, enabling high reliability and low maintenance.The NBA uses Cosmos DB to ingest more than 10 million data points per game, helping teams optimize their gameplay. And we are taking share with our analytics solutions. Companies like BP, Canadian Tire, Marks &amp; Spencer and T-Mobile all rely on our end-to-end analytics to improve speed to insight.Now on to developers.From Visual Studio to GitHub, we have the most popular tools to help every developer go from idea to code and code to cloud, all while staying in their flow. Today, 76% of the Fortune 500 use GitHub to build, ship and maintain software. And with GitHub Copilot, the first at-scale AI developer tool, we are fundamentally transforming the productivity of every developer from novices to experts.In three months since we made Copilot for Business broadly available, over 10,000 organizations have signed up, including the likes of Coca-Cola and GM as well as Duolingo and Mercado Libre, all of which credit Copilot with increasing the speed for their developers. We're also bringing next-generation AI to Power Platform so anyone can automate workflows, create apps or web pages, build virtual agents and analyze data using only natural language.More than 36,000 organizations have already used existing AI-powered capabilities in Power Platform.And with our new Copilot in Power Apps, we are extending these capabilities to end users who can interact with any app through conversation instead of clicks. All up, we now have nearly 33 million monthly active users of Power Platform, up nearly 50% year-over-year.Now on to business applications. From customer experience and service to finance and supply chain, we continue to take share across all categories we serve as organizations like Asahi, C.H. Robinson, E.ON, Franklin Templeton, choose our AI-powered business applications to automate, simulate and predict every business process and function.And we are going further with Dynamics 365 Copilot, which works across CRM and ERP systems to bring the next generation of AI to employees in every job function, reducing burdensome tasks like manual data entry, content generation and notetaking.Now on to our industry and cross-industry solutions.Our Cloud for Sustainability is seeing strong adoption from companies in every industry, including BBC, Nissan and TCL as they deliver on their respective environmental commitments. Our Cloud for Healthcare was front and center at HIMSS last week as we expanded our offerings for payors and added new AI-powered capabilities for providers.We showcased the first fully AI-automated clinical documentation application, Nuance DAX Express, which will bring GPT-4 to more than 550,000 existing users of Dragon Medical. And at Hannover Messe manufacturing trade show, Siemens shared how it will use a Teams app integrated with Azure OpenAI Service to optimize factory workflows.Now on to future of work. Microsoft 365 Copilot combines next-generation AI with business data in the Microsoft Graph and Microsoft 365 applications, removing the drudgery and unleashing the creativity of work.Copilot works alongside users embedded in the Microsoft 365 applications millions use every day, and it also powers Business Chat, which uses natural language to surface information and insights based on business content and context. We've been encouraged by early feedback and look forward to bringing these experiences to more users in the coming months.Teams usage is at an all-time high and surpassed 300 million monthly active users this quarter, and we once again took share across every category from collaboration to chat to meetings to calling as we add value for existing customers and win new ones like ABN AMRO, Jaguar Land Rover, Mattress Firm, Unisys and Vodafone. We announced a new version of Teams that delivers up to 2 times faster performance while using 50% less memory so customers can collaborate more efficiently and prepare for experiences like Copilot.Teams is also expanding our TAM.Nearly 60% of our enterprise Teams customers buy Teams Phone, Rooms or Premium. Teams Phone is the undisputed market leader in cloud calling, helping our customers reduce cost with a three year ROI of over 140%. Teams Rooms revenue more than doubled year-over-year and Teams Premium meets enterprise demand for AI-powered features like intelligent recaps. Now generally available, it's one of our fastest-growing Modern Work products ever with thousands of paid customers just two months in.With Microsoft Viva, we have created a completely new suite for employee experience. Viva brings together goals, communications, learning, workplace analytics and employee feedback. Across industries, companies like Dell, Mastercard and SES are using Viva to help their employees thrive.Just last week, we announced Copilot for Viva, offering leaders a new way to build high-performance teams by prioritizing both productivity and employee engagement.And with Viva Sales, we have extended the platform to specific job functions, helping sellers apply large language models to their CRM and Microsoft 365 data so that they can automatically generate content like customer mails. All this innovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365, Ferrovial, Goldman Sachs, Novo Nordisk and Rogers all chose E5 to empower their employees with our best-in-class productivity apps along with advanced security, compliance, voice and analytics.Now on to Windows. While the PC market continues to face headwinds, we again saw record monthly active Windows devices and higher usage compared to pre-pandemic.We're also seeing accelerated growth in Windows 11 commercial deployments. Over 90% of the Fortune 500 are currently trialing or have deployed Windows 11.And with Windows 365 and Azure Virtual Desktop, we continue to transform how our employees at companies like Mazda and Nationwide access Windows. All up, over one-third of our enterprise customer base has purchased cloud-delivered Windows to-date. And new Windows 365 Frontline extends the power and security of Cloud PCs to shift workers for the first time.Now on to security. Our comprehensive AI-powered solutions spanning all clouds and all platforms give the agility advantage back to defenders. Among analysts, we are the leader in more categories than any other provider. And we once again took share across all major categories we serve and we continue to introduce new products and functionality to further protect customers.With Security Copilot, we are combining large language models with a domain-specific model informed by our threat intelligence and 65 trillion daily security signals to transform every aspect of the SOC productivity.And we also added new governance controls and policy protections to better secure identities along with resources they access. Nearly 720,000 organizations now use Azure Active Directory, up 33% year-over-year.And all up, nearly 600,000 customers now have four or more security workloads, up 35% year-over-year, underscoring our end-to-end differentiation. EY and Qualcomm, for example, both chose our full security stack to ensure the highest levels of protection and visibility across their organizations.Now on to LinkedIn. We once again saw record engagement as more than 930 million members turn to the professional social network to connect, learn, sell and get hired. Member growth accelerated for the seventh consecutive quarter as we expanded to new audiences.We now have 100 million members in India, up 19%. And as Gen Z enters the workforce, we saw 73% year-over-year increase in the number of student sign-ups.In this persistently tight labor market, LinkedIn Talent Solutions continues to help hirers connect to job seekers and professionals to build the skills they need to access opportunity. Our hiring business took share for the third consecutive quarter. The excitement around AI is creating new opportunities across every function from marketing, sales and finance to software development and security. LinkedIn is increasingly where people are going to learn, discuss and up-level their skills with more than 100 AI courses. And we have introduced new AI-powered features, including writing suggestions for member profiles and job descriptions and collaborative articles.Finally, LinkedIn Marketing Solutions continues to be a leader in B2B digital advertising, helping companies deliver the right message to the right audience on a safe, trusted platform.More broadly, we continue to expand our opportunity in advertising. Our exclusive partnership with Netflix brings differentiated premium video content to our ad network, and our new Copilot for the web is reshaping daily search and web habits.Two months since the launch of new Bing and Edge, we are very encouraged by user feedback and usage patterns. All up, Bing has more than 100 million daily active users. We are winning new customers on Windows and mobile. Daily installs of the Bing mobile app have grown 4 times since launch. We are making progress in share gains. Edge took share for the eighth consecutive quarter and Bing once again grew share in the United States.We continue to innovate with first-of-their-kind AI-powered features, including the ability to set the tone of chat and create images from text prompts powered by DALL-E.Over 200 million images have been created to date and we see that when people use these new AI features their engagement with Bing and Edge goes up.As we look towards a future where chat becomes a new way for people to seek information, consumers have real choice in business model and modalities with Azure-powered chat entry points across Bing, Edge, Windows and OpenAI’s ChatGPT. We look forward to continuing this journey in what is a generational shift in the largest software category, search.Now on to gaming. We are rapidly executing on our ambition to be the first choice for people to play great games whenever, however and wherever they want. We set third quarter records for monthly active users and monthly active devices. Across our content &amp; services business, we are delivering on our commitment to offer gamers more ways to experience the games they love.Our revenue from subscriptions reached nearly $1 billion this quarter.This quarter, we also brought PC Game Pass to 40 new countries, nearly doubling the number of markets we are available. Great content remains the flywheel behind our growth. We have now surpassed 500 million lifetime unique users across our first-party titles. And I’ve never been more excited about our pipeline of games, including the fourth quarter launches of Minecraft Legends and Redfall.In closing, we are focused on continuing to raise the bar on our operational excellence and performance as we innovate to help our customers maximize the value of their existing technology investments and thrive in the new era of AI. In a few weeks times, we'll hold our Build conference, and we will share how we are building the most powerful AI platform for developers and I encourage you to tune in.I could not be more energized about the opportunities ahead.And with that, let me turn it over to Amy.Amy Hood Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter revenue was $52.9 billion, up 7% and 10% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.45 and increased 10% and 14% in constant currency.

In Office 365 stand-alone products, we saw improvement in new business growth, while growth trends in EMS and Windows Commercial standalone products remained consistent with Q2.In Azure, customers continued to exercise some caution as optimization and new workload trends from the prior quarter continued as expected.In our consumer business, PC demand was a bit better than we expected, particularly in the commercial segment, which benefited Windows OEM and Surface even as channel inventory levels remain elevated, which negatively impacted results. Advertising spend landed in line with our expectations.We have seen share gains in Azure, Dynamics, Teams, Security, Edge and Bing as we continue to focus on delivering high value as well as new innovative solutions to our customers, including next-generation AI capabilities. Commercial bookings increased 11% and 12% in constant currency on a strong prior year comparable with a declining expiry base and 3 points of unfavorable impact from the inclusion of Nuance in the prior year. The better-than-expected result was driven by strong execution across our renewal sales motions mentioned earlier.Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 26% to $196 billion.Roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 18% year-over-year. The remaining portion, which will be recognized beyond the next 12 months increased 34%. And this quarter, our annuity mix was again 96%. FX impact on total company revenue, segment level revenue and operating expense growth was as expected. FX decreased COGS growth by 2 points, 1 point favorable to expectations.Microsoft Cloud revenue was $28.5 billion and grew 22% and 25% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points year-over-year to 72%, a point ahead of expectations driven by cloud engineering efficiencies. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased slightly, driven by lower Azure margin.Company gross margin dollars increased 9% and 13% in constant currency, including 2 points due to the change in accounting estimate.Gross margin percentage increased year-over-year to 69%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased slightly, driven by a lower mix of OEM revenue.Operating expense increased 7% and 9% in constant currency, about $300 million lower than expected. Operating expense growth was driven by roughly 2 points from the Nuance and Xandr acquisitions as well as investments in cloud engineering and LinkedIn.At a total company level, head count at the end of March was 9% higher than a year ago. Operating income increased 10% and 15% in constant currency, including 4 points due to the change in accounting estimate. Operating margins increased roughly 1 point year-over-year to 42%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins decreased slightly and increased slightly in constant currency.Now to our segment results.Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $17.5 billion and grew 11% and 15% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, primarily driven by better-than-expected results in Office commercial. Office commercial revenue grew 13% and 17% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 14% and 18% in constant currency, slightly better than expected with the strong renewal execution mentioned earlier and E5 momentum.Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 11% year-over-year to over 382 million, with installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments. Seat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings. Office commercial licensing declined 1% and increased 5% in constant currency, better than expected with 11 points of benefit from transactional strength in Japan.Office consumer revenue increased 1% and 4% in constant currency with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 12% to 65.4 million.LinkedIn revenue increased 8% and 10% in constant currency, driven by growth in Talent Solutions. Dynamics revenue grew 17% and 21% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 25% and 29% in constant currency, with healthy growth across all workloads.Segment gross margin dollars increased 14% and 18% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased slightly, driven by improvements in Office 365, partially offset by sales mix shift to cloud offerings. Operating expenses increased 4% and 5% in constant currency, and operating income increased 20% and 27% in constant currency, including 4 points due to the change in accounting estimate.Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment.Revenue was $22.1 billion, increasing 16% and 19% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue increased 17% and 21% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 27% and 31% in constant currency. In our per user business, enterprise mobility and security installed base grew 15% to nearly 250 million seats.In our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 2% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency with continued demand for our hybrid offerings, including Windows Server and SQL Server running in multi-cloud environments, offset by transactional licensing. Enterprise Services revenue grew 6% and 9% in constant currency with better-than-expected performance across Enterprise Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services.Segment gross margin dollars increased 15% and 18% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased slightly.Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage declined roughly 3 points, driven by sales mix shift to Azure and the lower Azure margin noted earlier. Operating expenses increased 19% and 20% in constant currency, including roughly 3 points of impact from the Nuance acquisition. Operating income grew 13% and 17% in constant currency, with roughly 6 points from the change in accounting estimate.Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $13.3 billion, decreasing 9% and 7% in constant currency with better-than-expected results across all businesses. Windows OEM revenue decreased 28% year-over-year and Devices revenue decreased 30% and 26% in constant currency, both ahead of expectations. We saw better-than-expected PC demand, as noted earlier, particularly in the commercial segment, which has higher revenue per license, although results continue to be negatively impacted by elevated channel inventory levels.Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 14% and 18% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations, primarily due to the strong renewal execution with higher in-period revenue recognition noted earlier.Search and news advertising revenue ex TAC increased 10% and 13% in constant currency, including 2 points from the Xandr acquisition. Results were driven by higher search volume with share gains again this quarter for our Edge browser globally and Bing in the U.S.And in Gaming, revenue declined 4% and 1% in constant currency, ahead of expectations. Xbox hardware revenue declined 30% and 28% in constant currency on a high prior year comparable that benefited from increased console supply. Xbox content and services revenue increased 3% and 5% in constant currency, driven by better-than-expected monetization in third-party and first-party content and growth in Xbox Game Pass.Segment gross margin dollars declined 9% and 5% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased slightly year-over-year.Operating expenses declined 5% and 3% in constant currency, even with 3 points of growth from the Xandr acquisition. Operating income decreased 12% and 7% in constant currency.Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases were $7.8 billion to support cloud demand. Cash paid for PP&amp;E was $6.6 billion. Cash flow from operations was $24.4 billion, down 4% year-over-year as strong cloud billings and collections as well as lower supplier payments were more than offset by a tax payment related to the R&amp;D capitalization provisions and employee payments primarily related to headcount growth and an increase in employee compensation.Free cash flow was $17.8 billion, down 11% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of this tax payment, cash flow from operations increased 1% and free cash flow declined 5%.This quarter, other income and expense was $321 million, higher than anticipated, driven by net gains on foreign currency remeasurement. Our effective tax rate was approximately 19%. And finally, we returned $9.7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.Now moving to our Q4 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S. dollar basis. My commentary for the next quarter and FY '24 does not include any impact from Activision, which we continue to work towards closing in fiscal year 2023, subject to obtaining required regulatory approvals.Now to FX. Based on current rates, we expect FX to decrease total revenue growth by approximately 2 points with no impact to COGS or operating expense growth. Within segments, we anticipate roughly 2 points of negative FX impact on revenue growth in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud and roughly 1 point in More Personal Computing.Overall, our outlook has many of the trends we saw in Q3 continue through Q4.In our largest quarter of the year, we expect customer demand for our differentiated solutions, including our AI platform and consistent execution across the Microsoft Cloud to drive another quarter of healthy revenue growth. Last year, we had our largest commercial bookings quarter ever with a material volume of large multiyear commitments.On that comparable, we expect growth to be relatively flat. We expect consistent execution across our core annuity sales motions with strong renewals and continued commitment to our platform as we focus on meeting customers' changing contract needs, which include shorter term, quick time to value contracts in this dynamic environment.Our key focus remains on delivering customer value.Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be up roughly 2 points year-over-year, driven by the accounting estimate change noted earlier. Excluding that impact, Q4 cloud gross margin percentage will be relatively flat as improvements in Office 365 will offset the lower Azure margin and the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. We expect capital expenditures to have a material sequential increase on a dollar basis, driven by investments in Azure AI infrastructure. Reminder there can be normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure build-out.Next, to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 10% and 12% in constant currency or $17.9 billion to $18.2 billion.In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365, with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be roughly 16% in constant currency. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the low 30s.In Office consumer, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect mid-single digit revenue growth driven by Talent Solutions with continued strong engagement on the platform. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the mid- to high teens, driven by continued growth in Dynamics 365.For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 15% and 16% in constant currency or $23.6 billion to $23.9 billion.Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per user business and from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect revenue growth to be 26% to 27% in constant currency, including roughly 1 point from AI services. Growth continues to be driven by our Azure consumption business, and we expect the trends from Q3 to continue into Q4, as noted earlier.Our per-user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect continued moderation in growth rates given the size of the installed base. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline low single digits as demand for our hybrid solutions, including Windows Server and SQL Server running in multi-cloud environments, will be more than offset by unfavorable FX impact.And in Enterprise Services, revenue should be relatively unchanged year-over-year as growth in Enterprise Support Services will be offset by a decline in Microsoft Consulting Services.In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue of $13.35 billion to $13.75 billion. PC demand should be similar to Q3, and given channel inventory still remains elevated, our revenue will lag overall market growth as it continues to normalize. Therefore, Windows OEM and Devices revenue should both decline in the low to mid-20s.In Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue should decline low to mid-single digits. While we expect healthy annuity billings growth driven by continued customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions, a reminder that our quarterly revenue growth can have variability, primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts.Search and news advertising ex TAC revenue growth should be approximately 10%, roughly 5 points higher than the overall search and news advertising revenue, driven by growth in first-party revenue is similar to Q3.And in Gaming, we expect revenue growth in the mid- to high single digits. We expect Xbox content services revenue growth in the low to mid-teens, driven by third-party and first-party content as well as Xbox Game Pass.Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS to grow between 3% and 4% in constant currency or $16.8 billion to $17 billion and operating expense to grow approximately 2% in constant currency or $15.1 billion to $15.2 billion. Other income and expense should be roughly $300 million as interest income is expected to more than offset interest expense.As a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio, which can increase quarterly volatility. We expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be in line with our full year rate of approximately 19%.And finally, as a reminder, for Q4 cash flow, we expect to make a $1.3 billion cash tax payment related to the R&amp;D capitalization provision.Now I'd like to share some closing thoughts as we look to the next fiscal year. With our leadership position as we begin this AI era, we remain focused on strategically managing the company to deliver differentiated customer value as well as long-term financial growth and profitability. As with any significant platform shift, it starts with innovation. And we are excited about the early feedback and demand signals for the AI capabilities we have announced to date.We will continue to invest in our cloud infrastructure, particularly AI-related spend as we scale with the growing demand, driven by customer transformation.And we expect the resulting revenue to grow over time. As always, we remain committed to aligning cost and revenue growth to deliver disciplined profitability. Therefore, while the scaled CapEx investments will impact COGS growth, we expect FY '24 operating expense growth to remain low.As a team, we have continually focused on pivoting our resources aggressively to the future as we execute at a high level in the moment to deliver value to our customers. That balance has enabled the company to successfully lead across a number of platform shifts over a number of decades. Therefore, we are committed to leading the AI platform wave and making the investments to support it.With that, let's go to Q&amp;A. Brett?Brett Iversen Thanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&amp;A.Out of respect for others in the call, we request that participants please only ask one question. Joe, can you please repeat your instructions?See also Kevin O'Leary’s Stock Portfolio: 10 Stock Picks for 2023 and 25 Cheapest Countries in the World.Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions]Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.Keith Weiss Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and congratulations on really a fantastic set of results in what we all know to be a still difficult environment out there. I think it really illustrates Microsoft's advantages and a lot of these technology innovations that you guys have been talking about. I wanted to ask you a question that I get probably more often than anything else and one that I frankly don't have a good answer to, and that's around the OpenAI partnership and particularly the accounting for that partnership.So I was hoping you could give us a little bit of color about how -- whether or not revenue is flowing from OpenAI into Microsoft on the CapEx side of the equation, whether there's any impact. Just give us a better understanding of how the comping around that relationship is working.Amy Hood Thanks, Keith. In some ways, let me start by saying, it's a great partnership. We're proud to have worked together for a number of years, leading to some of the announcements that you've heard us make more recently. And we talked about the foundation of our partnership remains that when we both are successful, the other benefits. When we grow, it helps them, and when they grow, it helps us. But specifically to your question on how does it show up, it's easiest in this situation, to think about them as a customer of ours like any other customer who would use the Azure infrastructure and our Azure AI services in service of supporting their end customers.And so when they do that, like any other customer who has a commercial relationship with us, we recognize revenue on that behalf. That's probably the simplest frame, Keith, that I hope is helpful.Keith Weiss Yeah. That’s super helpful. I appreciate that.Brett Iversen Thanks, Keith. Joe, next question, please.Operator Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.Mark Moerdler Congratulations on the quarter and the guidance and thanks for taking my question. I'd like to drill into Azure and more specifically, Azure IaaS/PaaS consumption. IaaS/PaaS consumption has really stepped down recently, and it's important to understand the macro versus macro and optimization that will rebound, whether it's going to rebound quickly or is there a more fundamental issue?In other words, is it simply purely macro and everyone is stepping back a little bit and they're going to hit the pedal as soon as this comes back or is there something more fundamental that is driving corporate maybe to step back and that, that slowdown could sustain even when the IT spending rebounds. Thank you.Satya Nadella Thanks, Mark for the question. Maybe I'll make three comments. And it's also important, I think to distinguish between what I'd say, macro or absolute performance and relative performance because I think that's perhaps a good way to think about how we manage our business.First is optimizations do continue. In fact, we are focused on it. We incent our people to help our customers with optimization because we believe in the long run that the best way to secure the loyalty and long-term contracts with customers when they know that they can count on a cloud provider like us to help them continuously optimize their workload.That's sort of the fundamental benefit of public cloud, and we are taking every opportunity to prove that out with customers in real time.The second thing I'd say is, we do have new workloads started because if you think about it, during the pandemic, it was all about new workloads and scaling workloads. But pre pandemic, there was a balance between optimizations and new workloads. So what we're seeing now is the new workloads start in addition to highly intense optimization driven that we have.The third is perhaps more of a relative statement because of some of the work we've done in AI even in the last couple of quarters, we are now seeing conversations we never had, whether it's coming through you and just OpenAI's API, right? If you think about the consumer tech companies that are all spinning essentially Azure meters, because they have gone to open AI and are using their API.These were not customers of Azure at all.Second, even Azure OpenAI API customers are all new, and the workload conversations, whether it's B2C conversations in financial services or drug discovery on another side, these are all new workloads that we really were not in the game in the past, whereas we now are. So those are the three comments that I'd make, both in terms of absolute macro, but more importantly, I think, what is our relative market position and how it's being changed.Amy Hood Mark, maybe the one thing I would add to those comments is, we've been through almost a year where that pivot that Satya talked about from we're starting tons of new workloads, and we'll call that the pandemic time, to this transition post, and we're coming to really the anniversary of that starting.And so to talk to your point, we're continuing to set optimization. But at some point, workloads just can't be optimized much further. And when you start to anniversary that, you do see that it gets a little bit easier in terms of the comps year-over-year. And so you even see that in a little bit of our guidance, some of that impact from a year-over-year basis.Mark Moerdler That was incredibly helpful. I really do appreciate. Thank you for the color and again, congratulations on what's happening.Satya Nadella Thanks, Mark.Brett Iversen Joe, next question, please.Operator Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceedBrent Thill Thanks. On Copilot monetization, can you just give us a sense of how much shows up, where we're going to see it?And ultimately, is there a simple price lift that you think you can get through Copilot, say, 10%, 20%, 30% above where you saw the regular components of the Suite or is it too hard to factor in? Thank you.Satya Nadella I mean, overall, we do plan to monetize a separate set of meters across all of the tech stack, whether they're consumption meters or per user subscriptions. The Copilot that's priced and it is there is GitHub Copilot. That's a good example of incrementally how we monetize the prices that are there out there and others are to be priced because they're in preview mode. But you can expect us to do what we've done with GitHub Copilot pretty much across the board.Amy Hood Yeah, Brent. The best way of thinking about this is when we believe we’re adding a lot of value.And frankly, that’s what the Copilots are doing and some productivity improvement, you can expect that we will have this price for those and you’ll be able to look at that as we get to release, and to Satya’s point, GitHub Copilot is a great example.Brent Thill Thanks.Brett Iversen Joe, next question, please.Operator Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceedRaimo Lenschow Thank you. Congrats from me as well. Just staying on the AI theme and more thinking about the gross margin impact on Azure. Can you just, Satya, can you maybe a little - talk a little bit about like how you see the cost of compute for AI workloads versus kind of the classic workloads and how do you think that will evolve over time?Thank you.Satya Nadella Yes, a couple of them. One is clearly the accelerated compute is what gets used to drive AI. And the thing that we are very, very focused on is to make sure that we get it very efficient in the usage of those resources. If you think about sort of what the hyperscaler does, it's not just rack and stack sort of hardware. They use software to optimize the performance of a given workload and, in fact, heterogeneous workloads on a given set of hardware.And so we have many knobs that we’ll continuously continue to drive optimization across it. And you see it even in the -- even for a given generation of a large model, where we started them to the cost footprint to where we end in the cost footprint even in a period of a quarter changes.So you can expect us to do what we have done over the decade plus with the public cloud to bring the benefits of, I would say, continuous optimization of our COGS to a diverse set of workloads.The other thing I'd mention is that there are a lot of workloads now. Like one of the reasons why we got together with OpenAI primarily was we came out and said, this type of workload, whether it's a training or an inference workload is going to be much more generally relevant for us, not just in the context of AI. And so you can see us apply it in other context as well.Amy Hood And Raimo, we talked a bit about this when we talked about the new Edge and the new Bing with analysts. And I think one of the important things to keep in mind, which Satya is pointing to is that it's not really just the cost of Azure and the ability to optimize across the Azure workloads.It's that really even our first-party workloads and apps that are built, right, are built on the same platform, and we're able because we are a hyperscaler and because we have a large commercial cloud first-party as well as consumer apps like Bing that are first party, we're able to take advantage of that and GPU utilization, AI services utilization across the stack. And so it's not just sort of where Satya wanted to see even a broader benefit of being a hyperscaler.Raimo Lenschow Thank you.Brett Iversen Thanks, Raimo. Joe, next question please.Operator Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO. Please proceedKeith Bachman Good afternoon. Good evening. Thank you for taking the question. I want to address this up to you, if I could.On your prepared remarks, you commented that you thought that operating expense growth would be lower. I was hoping to just maybe flesh that out with some broader comments. Could you talk about how you see any kind of directional color on how you see gross margins evolving, given mix and particularly supporting generative AI and/or any other comments that might help shape our thinking as we begin to look at the operating margin for the next fiscal year? Thank you.Amy Hood Thanks, Keith. It's probably a good opportunity to explain a bit about how I think about where we are, which is -- if you look at all of the businesses we're in and we look about our competitiveness in those businesses. And this is before Satya started to comment a bit about our relative performance versus absolute.And I'll tell you that the energy and focus we put right now is on relative performance and share gains.Right now, we have the largest commercial cloud with increasing commitments by customers, with new workloads, new TAM opportunities that something you're talking about with customers. And our focus is going to be and will be on continuing to take a growing share of that while we continue to focus on our customers' success in getting a ton of value out of what we are selling, whether that's the E5 product, the Microsoft 365, whether that's Windows 365 to help, maybe it's on compute costs and PC cost, whether it's working across the Azure stack.And so with that opportunity plus in our consumer business, the largest number of active devices we've had in Windows, are still being used more being able to focus on edge share and being share and gaming -- bringing it to the PC as well across to mobile, these are the opportunities that we focus on as we think about next year.And so if we feel like and I do, that we are well positioned to continue to take share in so many key places, then I say, great, and we want to be able to focus on investing in AI, which I talked about, will increase COGS growth, but we're committed to making sure we have healthy profitability by keeping operating expenses low.And so what really this past year has been about, but really what Q3 starts to show is our willingness to pivot to the future to make sure we can keep all those commitments that Satya listed.So while I know that's not giving specificity, it is, in fact, how we think about long-term success, in being well positioned in big markets, taking share in those markets, committing to make sure we're going to lead this wave, staying focused on gross margin improvements where we can. Some of them will come in AI over time, given our commitment to the build-out. We will charge for those AI capabilities and then ultimately will deliver operating profit.Satya Nadella Yeah. I mean, just to add to it, during these periods of transition, the way I think as shareholders, you may want to look at is what's the opportunity set ahead.We have a differentiated play to go after that opportunity set, which we believe we have. Both the opportunity set in terms of TAM is bigger, and our differentiation at the very start of a cycle, we feel we have a good lead and we have differentiated offerings up and down the stack.And so therefore, that's the sort of approach we're going to take, which is how do we maximize the return of that starting position for you all as shareholders long term. That's sort of where we look at it. And we'll manage the P&amp;L carefully driving operating leverage in a disciplined way but not being shy of investing where we need to invest in order to grab the long-term opportunity. And so obviously, we will see share gains first, usage first, then GM, then OPInc, right, like a classic P&amp;L flow.But we feel good about our position.Keith Bachman All right. Many thanks for the answer.Brett Iversen Thanks, Keith. Joe, next question, please.Operator Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceedKarl Keirstead Thanks. We've had a lot of questions on AI and Azure, so maybe just to round it out. Just on the Office 365 business, Amy. 16% constant currency guide for June, not really seeing much seat degradation despite obviously a tight labor market, so it's proven to be very resilient. Could you just unpack the sensitivity to that headcount reduction, given that across your customer base, at least slower rate of hiring, just given that this is an enormous seat-based business? It doesn't seem to be showing up.Maybe you could just help us understand what's driving that continued seat growth and how durable that is?Amy Hood Thanks, Karl. I think I would step back and say we have seen, I mean, the Office 365 suite but broadly, the Microsoft 365 suite adds a ton of value for users. And so if you think about the users and on the global base, we've been able to add users, which you continue to see. We still have in the frontline scenario at an SMB opportunity to continue to grow. And in the enterprise, where we are a basic productivity tool, the labor market is still tight in most places, and we continue to see customers committed to the value they're getting.And so I -- this is not something that -- I think our focus has really been on continuing to get healthy renewals, continue to add new products at renewal where it makes sense to save customers money and increase value.And so I think that's the story of the resilience you're seeing. And of course, we did have a good E5 quarter, which you're starting to see and it helps on ARPU.Brett Iversen Joe, next question, please.Operator Our next question comes from the line of Rishi Jaluria with RBC. Please proceedRishi Jaluria Hi, Satya. Hi, Ami. Thanks so much for taking my question. Nice to see continued resilience in the business. I wanted to get back to the topic of AI but I think maybe a little bit longer term. What -- how are you thinking about the potential for regulation around AI, some of the concerns around data and customer privacy and governance? And what do you think you can do to maybe quell some of those fears that governments and customers and organizations have around that?Thanks.Satya Nadella Yeah. Thanks, Rishi for the question. So overall, we've taken the approach that we are not waiting for regulation to show up. We are taking an approach where the unintended consequences of any new technology is something that from day 1, we think, about as first class and build into our engineering process all the safeguards. So for example, in 2016 is when we put out the AI principles, we translated the AR principles into a set of internal standards that then are further translated into an implementation process that then we hold ourselves to internal audit essentially.So that's the framework we have. We have a Chief AI Officer who is sort of responsible for both thinking of what the standards are and then the people who even help us internally audit our following of the process.And so we feel very, very good in terms of us being able to create trust in the systems we put out there. And so we will obviously engage with any regulation that comes up in any jurisdiction. But quite honestly, we think that the more there is any form of trust as a differentiated position in AI, I think we stand to gain from that.Rishi Jaluria All right. Wonderful. Thank you so much.Brett Iversen Thanks, Rishi. Joe, we have time for one last question.Operator And our last question will come from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo. Please proceedMichael Turrin Hey. Great. Thanks. Appreciate you squeezing me in. I want to ask a question on the consolidation play that Microsoft is positioning for giving. That's something we hear clearly top of mind for IT decision-makers currently.You have clear plays there across security infrastructure apps and other areas. So it would just be great to hear your view on the Microsoft consolidation playbook in the current environment, and if there are certain areas you're particularly focused on or seeing more traction around. Thank you.Satya Nadella Yeah. I mean, I'll start and Amy, you can add. I think Amy referenced to even in the context of Microsoft 365 and Office 365. But fundamentally, what we are focused on is making sure that the customers are able to derive the value out of our offerings, right, whether it's the Microsoft 365 suite value, which is significant, whether it's E3 or E5. And we want to make sure that our -- they're getting deployed, they're getting used and that's obviously going to lead to our share gains in many cases.Same thing in security. That's a place where this quarter, you saw some good results from us.And same on up and down the stack across Azure, right? So when you think about AI, the anatomy of an AI application is not just an AI model. In fact, ChatGPT itself is a great example. ChatGPT, for example, uses Cosmos DB as their core database. And so therefore, we want to make sure that our services, as they are competitive, get used together, whether it's the IaaS layer, the PaaS layer or the SaaS layer.Amy Hood And maybe one thing I would add, Michael, is that I know the question is consolidation, but another aspect of that is that some of the new business process automation work that's going to get done, whether that's the Dynamics workload that we've talked about, it also will benefit from having the AI services available on Azure, from having the core Azure capabilities as well as actually some front-end stuff that people are buying in Microsoft 365 to close these loops in a new way.And so I think maybe it's not the traditional definition of consolidation.But when people look and say, what vendor adds a lot of value and has the tools that we need and, in many instances, already own to be able to do this business process work, I think we have a great value and, frankly, probably leading tools in almost every vertical.Michael Turrin Great. Thank you.Brett Iversen Thank you, Michael. That wraps up the Q&amp;A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon.

100,64f8bc11-0f35-3bb7-88dc-96c931f1a1b4,PH,2023-04-28,Parker-Hannifin (PH) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/parker-hannifin-ph-earnings-expected-140202132.html,1682604122,STORY,['PH'],"[The market expects Parker-Hannifin (PH) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 4. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis maker of motion and control products is expected to post quarterly earnings of $5.03 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +4.1%.Revenues are expected to be $4.8 billion, up 17.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.72% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Parker-Hannifin?For Parker-Hannifin, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.43%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Parker-Hannifin will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Parker-Hannifin would post earnings of $4.45 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.76, delivering a surprise of +6.97%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Parker-Hannifin appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Manufacturing - General Industrial industry, Ingersoll Rand (IR), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.52 per share for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +6.1%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $1.48 billion, up 10.7% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Ingersoll has been revised 1.3% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 2.32%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), this Earnings ESP indicates that Ingersoll will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

While soaring commodity prices have made spending difficult for consumers, higher interest rates are making raw materials expensive. However, the latest report from the Census Bureau comes as inflation is showing signs of easing lately.The manufacturing sector has been struggling amid price pressures but higher orders for transportation equipment helped boost orders for durable goods in March. Given this scenario, stocks like Hubbell Incorporated HUBB, Parker-Hannifin Corporation PH, Ingersoll Rand Inc. IR and Flowserve Corporation FLS are expected to benefit in the near term.Durable Goods Order JumpOn Apr 26, the Census Bureau said that orders for goods made in U.S. factories jumped a solid 3.2% in March or $8.6 billion, surpassing estimates of a 0.8% increase. The rebound follows a 1.2% decline in February.Excluding defense, orders for new goods increased 3.5% in March. The jump in March was led by a solid increase in orders for transportation equipment.Orders for transportation equipment also bounced back after monthly declines in January and February. Transportation equipment orders rose $8.1 billion or 9.1% to $97.4 billion.Excluding transportation, orders for durable goods rose 0.3% in March.Shipments of manufactured durable goods grew 1.1%, or $2.9 billion, in March to reach $277 billion. This follows a 0.8% decline in February.New orders for nondefense capital goods jumped $8.4 billion or 10.4% to $89.6 billion in March. Shipments for nondefense goods climbed $3 billion, or 3.6% to $85.8 billion.The manufacturing sector has been struggling lately amid inflationary pressures. Production at U.S. factories has been declining for the past few months. However, signs of a rebound can finally be seen. The report came days after the Fed said that industrial production rose 0.4% in March, surpassing estimates of an increase of 0.2%. Year over year, industrial production grew 0.5% in March.Story continuesAlso, capacity utilization, which indicates overall demand and growth in the economy, rose 0.2% to 79.8% in March, surpassing estimates of 79.1%.The rebound in both industrial production and new orders for durable goods comes as inflation showed signs of easing in February.The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, increased 0.3% in February, beating analysts’ expectations of a rise of 0.4% and but coming in lower than January’s jump of 0.5%On a year-over-year basis, PCE increased 4.6% in February, slightly lower than the January level. The decline definitely is helping the manufacturing sector as evident from the solid jump in orders for durable goods in March.Our ChoicesGiven this scenario, it will be prudent to invest in stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank that are poised to gain from the solid durable goods orders. We narrowed down our search to four such stocks. Each of these stocks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Hubbell Incorporated is engaged in the design, manufacture and sale of electrical and electronic products to commercial, industrial, utility and telecommunications markets.

The continuation of these upsides bodes well in the face of cost inflation.  Kraft Heinz has been grappling with the rising inflationary environment for a while now. On its last earnings call, management highlighted that it expects high-single-digit inflation during 2023. This raises concerns for the quarter under review.However, a focus on the operating model (laid out in September 2020) has been working well. The model incorporates five key elements, which include People with Purpose, Consumer Platforms, Ops Center, Partner Program and Fuel Our Growth.Additionally, management is on track with transformation efforts.

The introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act 2022 should support the industry’s transition toward clean energy sources to produce electricity. Utilities are also focused on strengthening the grid as well as transmission and distribution infrastructure.The huge infrastructure of the utilities faces the impact of the hurricane season each year. Infrastructure enhancement around the year increases the resilience of the entire system, reduces outages and allows operators to restore power quickly for customers affected by storms.NextEra Energy, with large renewable operations and well-chalked-out capital investments to strengthen infrastructure, offers an excellent opportunity to stay invested in the utility space. Other utilities worth adding to your portfolio include American Electric Power, Xcel Energy and Consolidated Edison.About the IndustryThe Utility – Electric Power industry involves the process of generation, transmission, distribution, storage and sale of electricity to customers. A substantial portion of utilities’ earnings is generated from regulated operations. Unless there is any major weather variation or unprecedented incidents, such as the coronavirus pandemic, demand for the services provided by utilities remains more or less steady, regardless of economic cycles.A clear transition is evident in this industry, with more companies declaring zero-emission goals on their own. Research and development over the years have resulted in a substantial decline in the cost of setting up utility-scale renewable power projects, aiding in the reduction of emissions. However, the ongoing increase in interest rates is a concern for capital-intensive utilities.Story continues3 Electric Power Industry Trends to Watch Out ForTransition Toward Cleaner Sources to Generate Power:  The operators in the U.S. electric power sector are gradually moving toward cleaner sources of energy to produce electricity. Per EIA, the annual share of U.S. electricity generation from renewable energy sources will rise from 22% in 2022 to 24% in 2023 as a result of the continuing addition of solar and wind-generating capacity.EIA expects total solar, wind generation and battery storage addition from the end of 2022 to the end of 2024 to be 77 gigawatts (GW). The expansion of renewable energy continues to eat into the share of coal in electricity generation. EIA expects coal contribution to electricity generation to fall from 20% in 2022 to 17% annually in the 2023-2024 period.The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will support and accelerate the utilities’ transition toward clean energy sources. IRA has removed the uncertainties relating to federal incentives provided for renewable sources usage. The act entails an opportunity for a wide range of low-cost clean energy solutions in a predictable way for a long time and will create earnings visibility.Courtesy of IRA, the utility operators are planning to add more renewable assets to their generation portfolio and shut down old polluting units. Per EIA, from 2022-end through 2024, 11 GW of coal-fired units will retire in the United States.Demand for Electricity Stable: Per EIA, electricity consumption in the United States can drop 1.1% in 2023 and nearly 1.6% in 2024. EIA believes that the expected drop in demand for electricity this year will be due to a milder summer forecast that would lead to less requirement for cooling. Despite the expected drop in consumption, the utilities will continue to add new renewable energy assets to the total generation portfolio.Ongoing Interest Rate Increase is a Concern: Utilities, to maintain, upgrade and expand operations, approach capital markets for loans. The utilities have been enjoying near-zero interest rates for the past few years. But multiple rate hikes in 2022 pushed up interest rates. In March 2023, the Federal Reserve again raised interest rates by 25 percentage points, taking the benchmark rate to a range of 4.75-5%.The increasing interest rates are a concern for capital-intensive utilities in the United States as these will push up capital servicing costs substantially from the current levels. U.S. utilities are currently spending a substantial amount on developing an advanced electricity network and strengthening infrastructure.Utilities might try to pass on the burden of increasing borrowing costs to customers but the necessary increase in rates might not get approved by the commission. In such a scenario, the utilities will need to digest the extra expenses, which can lower their profitability and make them less attractive to investors interested in the utility space.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates strong near-term prospects. The 56-stock Utility-Electric Power industry is housed within the broader Zacks Utilities sector and currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #88, which places it in the top 35% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

My name is George, and I'll be a coordinator for today's event. Please note, this conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I'll now hand it over to Mr. Paul Johnson, Vice President, Treasurer, and Investor Relations, to begin this conference. Please go ahead, sir.Paul Andrew JohnsonThank you. Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2023 First Quarter Earnings Call. Joining me today are Bob Frenzel, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer your questions if needed. This morning, we will review our '23 first quarter results and highlights and share recent business developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website.As a reminder, some of the comments made during today's call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our SEC filings. Today, we will discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures. Information on the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release. With that, I'll turn it over to Bob.Story continuesRobert C. FrenzelThanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with our first quarter results. We had another solid financial quarter, recording earnings of $0.76 per share for 2023 compared to $0.70 per share in 2022. The increase in earnings largely reflects new revenue to recover our investments in clean energy and grid systems for the benefit of our customers. Our business plan is on track for the year, and as a result, we are reaffirming our 2023 earnings guidance of $3.30 to $3.40 per share. This quarter, we continue to make progress on our industry-leading clean energy transition plans. We've received and reviewed a significant number of proposals in our pending solicitations for nearly 6,000 megawatts of new electric generation across multiple jurisdictions.We anticipate commission decisions on these various proceedings in the second half of '23 and remain confident in our ability to deliver a beneficial mix of both company-owned and third-party resources across those plans. We also continue to pursue the benefits and opportunities provided by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act to accelerate the clean energy transition. We recently submitted multiple projects to the Department of Energy for funding consideration, including the multiparty Heartland and Western Interstate Hydrogen Hub and grid resilience investments in Colorado.In addition, we recently applied for DOE and venture capital grants for our long-duration energy storage proposals in Colorado and Minnesota and believe we are well-positioned to receive some or all of our requests. Our country and our company need new technologies, like long-duration storage, like hydrogen and clean fuels to commercialize in order to realize a clean energy future. And at Xcel Energy, we are actively working to do our part for the regions and the customers that we serve. And while the promise of a clean energy future is bright, we are keenly aware of the financial challenges that some of our customers experienced this winter with a significant rise in gas prices that we saw in 2022, driven by macroeconomic and geopolitical issues.Xcel Energy is proud of our long track record of keeping customer bills amongst the lowest in the country and to transition to a cleaner energy future with bill increases below the rate of inflation. We believe that affordability, reliability and sustainability can be realized concurrently through thoughtful energy policy and excellent operations. We've taken a number of steps in recent years that have saved customers' money and reduced exposure to commodity volatility. In our electric business, Xcel Energy's nearly 4,500 megawatts of owned wind farms continue to be a leader in capacity factor performance and generated $1.1 billion of fuel-related customer benefits in 2022 and more than $3 billion since 2017.Future investments in renewable generation and clean fuels will continue to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and add further benefits to our customers. Since 2014, we've kept our operating and maintenance expenses nearly flat and well below inflation through our continuous improvement programs, which is a benefit that accrues to our customers' bills. Our numerous energy efficiency and demand management programs have saved enough energy to avoid building approximately 25 average-sized power plants. And in 2022, we disbursed a record $216 million in state and federal payment assistance funds to customers across our states, and we expect to exceed that record in 2023.Also, in partnership with Colorado Staff, Colorado Energy Office, Energy Outreach Colorado and the Utility Consumer Advocate, we proposed to the commission to increase funding to support income-qualified customers burdened by high energy costs. We expect to provide those increased benefits to our customers throughout 2023 and beyond. And with recent declines in natural gas prices, we proactively lowered our gas recovery mechanism in Colorado 4x, reducing customers' gas costs by 58%. Our customers in our other states are seeing comparable benefits. In Colorado, we've been working with stakeholders on proposed legislation regarding customer affordability, rate stability and the regulatory process. And finally, in addition to our energy efficiency programs, we are relooking at potential long-term solutions to reduce price volatility that could include physical and financial hedging, additional natural gas storage, long-term natural gas supply contracts, multiyear rate plans, natural gas cost deferrals, energy decoupling and the use of renewable energy to generate clean fuels for blending in the natural gas LDC.We are confident that if implemented, these actions can help reduce natural gas volatility in the future for our customers. As I wrap up, I'm pleased to share some of the company's recent recognition. For the tenth year in a row, we've been honored as one of the world's most admired companies by Fortune Magazine. We ranked first in social responsibility and quality of management, placing second overall amongst the most admired electric and gas companies in the country. In addition, for the fourth year in a row, Xcel Energy has been named one of the world's most ethical companies by Ethisphere, a global leader in defining and advancing the standards of ethical business practices.None of this will be possible without the commitment of our employees, contractors and our partners. And while we're proud of our track record and our accolades, we will never rest on our mission to provide our customers with safe, clean, reliable energy services at a competitive price. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian.Brian J. Van AbelThanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. We had another solid quarter, reporting earnings of $0.76 per share for the first quarter of 2023 compared with $0.70 per share in 2022. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter included the following: higher electric and natural gas revenues increased earnings by $0.24 per share, reflecting new revenue to recover investments in our electric and natural gas systems and clean energy infrastructure. A lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.02 per share. But keep in mind, production tax credits lowered the ETR.However, PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin and are largely earnings-neutral. In addition, other items combined to increase earnings by $0.01 per share. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation expense, which reduced earnings by $0.08 per share, reflecting our capital investment program, higher O&amp;M expense, which decreased earnings by $0.06 per share and higher interest expense and other taxes which decreased earnings by $0.07 per share. Turning to sales. Weather-adjusted electric sales increased by 0.6% for the first 3 months of 2023. We continue to expect annual electric sales growth of approximately 1% in 2023, driven by C&amp;I sales, while we expect residential sales to be down slightly for the year.O&amp;M expenses increased $48 million for the first quarter. The increase was primarily due to timing differences associated with regulatory recovery mechanisms, generation outages and emergent work, inflationary pressures and investments in electric vehicle programs and other customer products. We continue to expect O&amp;M to decrease approximately 2% in 2023 compared with last year. We've also made progress on a number of regulatory proceedings. The commission recently approved our settlement in the Minnesota natural gas rate case, which reflects a rate increase of $21 million, an ROE of 9.57%, an equity ratio of 52.5% in the decoupling mechanism and property tax tracker.In the Minnesota electric case, we received a constructive ALJ recommendation including a 9.87% ROE and a 52.5% equity ratio. We anticipate a commission decision in June and final rates implemented in the fall. During the quarter, we filed a Texas electric rate case seeking a rate increase of $158 million based on an ROE of 10.65%, an equity ratio of 54.6% in the historic test year in the early retirement of the Tolk coal plant. We anticipate a commission decision and implementation of final rates in the first quarter of 2024. Our electric rate case in Colorado is early in the process.Intervenor recommendations are due in May, and we'll see if there's a potential to reach a settlement with parties. A commission decision and implementation of final rates are expected in the fall. In our New Mexico electric rate case, intervenors filed an initial testimony. The staff recommended a forward test year with a rate increase of $37 million based on an ROE of 9.35% and an equity ratio of 54.7%. Other intervenors recommended equity ratios in the range of 45% to 54.7% and ROEs between 8.7% to 9.6%. We anticipate a decision later in the year. Finally, later this month, we'll file a rate case in Wisconsin, seeking an electric rate increase of approximately $40 million and a natural gas rate increase of approximately $9 million based on a 10.25% ROE, a 52.5% equity ratio and a 2024 future test year. We expect the commission to decide on the case before year-end with new rates in effect in January. Details on these cases are included in our earnings release. We are reaffirming our 2023 earnings guidance range of $3.30 to $3.40 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%. We've updated our key assumptions to reflect the latest information, which are detailed in our earnings release.With that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. Our customers continue to have some of the lowest bills in the country, we remain committed to keeping long-term bill growth below the rate of inflation while leading the clean energy transition and reducing customer exposure to volatility in fossil fuel prices. We continue to achieve constructive regulatory outcomes across our operating companies with progress across multiple rate cases. We have received a significant number of generation bids in response to our RFPs with additional RFPs forthcoming. We are reaffirming our 2023 earnings guidance, and we remain confident, we continue to deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within the upper half of our 5% to 7% objective range as we lead the clean energy transition. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Today's first question is coming from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithThank you, guys, for the time. Appreciate it. Look, I wanted to talk about the proposed legislation and just efforts in Colorado to address the affordability, obviously, a lot of different comments out there. Can you set a little bit of your thoughts out there as to what the key tools and mechanisms and avenues that exist out there? And then ultimately, how to address some of the recovery issues and some of the perception issues?Robert C. FrenzelYes. Julien, good to hear your voice on a Thursday morning. So we've been -- I appreciate your question. Look, as I think about legislation in Colorado that got introduced last week, pretty late in the session. We've been very keenly aware, as I said in my prepared remarks around the impacts to our customers from the volatility in natural gas prices that occurred largely last year and the declines that we've seen this year. And we've taken a lot of steps, both on the communications side and on the price mitigation side to assist there and obviously more to do. The legislation itself as proposed, was introduced in the Senate.And with the idea that we look at both price and price volatility that we saw over the past year, really with the benefit of our customers in mind, requires the company in the PUC. And again, this is still in -- it was approved by the Senate, I believe, yesterday, and it's going to go to the house maybe today or tomorrow. But requires a company in the PUC to look at all the mechanisms that can be helpful for our customers on price and price volatility. As I think about it, I think it provides tools on both the front end and the back end of the gas procurement cycle. So think on the front end, hedging and hedging tools, thinking -- rethinking about long-term storage, physical and financial hedging and things like that on the front end of the cycle.The legislation also takes a look at the back end of the cycle in the event that there are price volatility that exceeds a forecast, then we look at mechanisms for deferrals so that it may not be felt immediately in the pocket books of our customers. And I think those mechanisms much to be determined in the regulatory process, but the legislation contemplates those mechanisms being very beneficial to mitigate the volatility that we saw over the past year. I think the third piece of the legislation looks at something we've been already working with -- proactively with the commission on, which is incentive mechanism that provides an incentive to the company to meet or beat gas price forecast and manage the volatility for our customers.Again, lots of details that have to get worked through the regulatory process. But on balance, the intention is to really protect customers from the volatility we saw over the last year with regulatory mechanisms.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithI hear you on that front. And then ultimately, as you think about this, mean just on the electric business, I mean, does this change anything in terms of procurement? Obviously, that could feed into some of those conversations. And then related on the gas side, any initial thoughts as to what this could mean from a financial perspective, maybe too early.Robert C. FrenzelYes. Look, I think on the gas procurement side, it applied to procurement for both the electric and the gas business. More broadly speaking, it also looks at -- it asked us to do a cost causation study around gas LDC customers and how we make future long-term investments into the gas system allows for some distributed energy resources and the ability to add those to our systems maybe in a more expeditious manner. So there's some factors like that in the electric and gas, probably a little too early to say what the long-term implications on our capital forecasting are in the state, but I don't think it will be necessarily material in totality.Brian J. Van AbelYes. And Julien, I would just add, we're scheduled to file a clean heat plant in Colorado in August, which is really -- I equate that to call it a resource planning process on the electric side. So really working through with our commission and our stakeholders is how do we do decarbonize the LDC. We have legislation with targets in 2030 and then a net zero target longer term. So we're looking forward to working with all our stakeholders about how we decarbonize our LDC, and I think that's a real opportunity as we put plans in place for a longer term.OperatorOur next question will be coming from Durgesh Chopra calling from Evercore ISI.Durgesh ChopraTeam, thanks for the update. I just wanted to -- I was going to ask you a question on Colorado, which you just answered. But just maybe can we get an update on the tax credits transferability? You have, what, $1.8 billion in the plan that is going to come from the tax credit transferability through 2027. Maybe just update us on your efforts there? And then can you remind us, I think you've disclosed this in the past, what are you assuming in terms of funds from that activity this year?Brian J. Van AbelDurgesh, thanks for the question. Something we're very focused on, not only transferability guidance, but guidance for the other aspects of the IRA. But specific to transferability on the guidance, we expect guidance to be issued in Q2 for transferability. And for us, we're looking for a fairly straightforward guidance, right? We would call it clean, no pun intended, a clean seller of these tax credits here from wind farms that have already been in service. And so we're looking for documentation and the certification requirements, in terms of sale, registration requirements, so pretty basic stuff.So that's really what we're looking for out of the guidance from the IRS. The other aspect is we've talked to about 20 counterparties already, and there is a significant amount of interest in the purchases of our tax credits, not only this year but for a longer term. So we're pretty confident in terms of our ability to execute on this at a good price for our customers. And so I think about this, we get guidance in Q2, I would expect us to start executing in Q3. And this year, we took a pretty conservative approach. We really expected to sell about $200 million of tax credits in our financing plan. That's about of half of what we could sell this year. So -- and then we'd assume we sell the remainder of it in the year after. But that's kind of our view on transferability and I think is a great mechanism as we think about the longer-term cost of renewable projects and how we can be the most tax efficient with those tax credits.Durgesh ChopraGot it. And then just -- how will you announce like as you sell these tax credits, is that just going to be in your back half of the year earnings calls? Or are there going to be depending on how sizable these are other sort of 8-K type announcements any...Brian J. Van AbelNo, I think we just included in our quarterly earnings calls. Obviously, there may be -- depending on the counterparty, they may want to make some announcement about it if they're thinking about -- how they're thinking about they're supporting the clean energy transition by other counterparties may not want to. So -- but the expectation would be in our quarterly earnings calls.OperatorWe'll now take questions from David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley.David Keith ArcaroI was wondering if you could comment a little bit on what you're seeing in the RFPs that you've got outstanding right now, how Xcel is competing. And if you're seeing cost increase or decrease just in terms of inflationary pressures or if some of these project proposals are coming in at more attractive prices?Brian J. Van AbelDavid, thanks for the question. So still working through the RFP processes, and I can comment on Colorado because we made a what we call a 30-day filing in Colorado that talked about the median prices that we've seen, incredible amount of interest in the projects and in the bid process. On the wind side, the median price was about $22 from an LCOE perspective. And if you think about that, that's -- if we didn't have IRA and we didn't have any tax credits that would probably be closer to $50. So a really great opportunity from a customer savings perspective with the IRA in what we're seeing. Now that's slightly above the RFP that we did 5 years ago, as you can see some inflationary pressures on CapEx.On the solar side, the median price is about $33. Now I'm giving you a median price. We have not disclosed the project portfolio that will happen in August when we make our filing and with our recommended portfolio to the commission. But overall, you think our project portfolio will come in well below those median prices that we've stated. So overall, I think we set ourselves up well with the number of bids we put in from a self-build perspective. We've been at the scheme for a long time from the wind side. And now we've proven with [Circle] solar and the price point we've delivered Circle solar that we can be very competitive. So I think, overall, we're excited about getting these RFPs.I talked about Colorado because that's the one that we've at least shared some information. Minnesota expect a filing from us here in May on the Minnesota RFP. And then on the SPS, RFP, expect a filing in Q3. So we'll give everyone kind of full transparency and visibility into the opportunities later in this year. But I would say, overall, we're pretty excited and excited to execute on some of these wind and solar and storage projects for the benefit of our customers.David Keith ArcaroOkay. Got it. Great. And then could you also give any more color just related to the water leak at the Monticello plant? What was the cost of the repair? Curious if you see any broader or more significant issues that popped up just in inspecting it. And then what's the status of the plant now and when it would be coming back online?Robert C. FrenzelDavid, it's Bob. Thanks for the question. As we think about the water leak at Monticello, the repair costs were not significant. We -- as we said in our releases, we have contained the leak, repaired the pipe are in the process of removing the water from the aquifer below the plant. There was no risk to people or planet in the process. We're about halfway -- close to halfway through that water removal, expect to finish it probably end of this year, early next. So not a material increase in the cost side. It's really about pumping water out of the plants. The plants planned to shut down for refueling. We do refueling at Monticello every 2 years. And I expect they probably have 2 more weeks before they finish loading fuel and restarting the plant, but it is ready to go.OperatorWe'll now take questions from Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan.Jeremy Bryan TonetJust want to pivot to Minnesota a little bit, if I could. And I didn't know if you could share any other thoughts with regards to remaining priorities out of Minnesota electric ALJ recommendation there. Are there any particular points to address in the final stages of this rate case from your perspective?Robert C. FrenzelSure. No, look, I appreciate the question. The process really continues. Since we last got together, we filed our -- the ALJ filed their recommendations at the end of March. We certainly didn't get all that we asked for in the ALJ filing, but as litigation goes, that's not atypical for the process. We'll file some exceptions and some things that the ALJ recommended we take up in a future proceeding or have the commission take up, I wouldn't say it's terribly material on the exception side.We haven't had a general rate case since 2016, prosecuted in the state on the electric side. And so we think that the recommendation from the ALJ was pretty thoughtful for all sides of the argument. And expect the commission to look at the ALJ's recommendation as well as some of the mitigation mechanisms that we put in place as a company to mitigate the impact to customers for having been out for a long time. We shall take it up in probably early June, and we expect the decision by the end of the second quarter.Jeremy Bryan TonetGot it. And then just kind of pivoting towards MISO. Just as far as tranche 2 is concerned, what are you hearing there? Are there any updated thoughts from your side, what kind of -- what are current timing expectations for initial thoughts on CapEx potential there?Brian J. Van AbelYes. Thanks for the question, Jeremy. I think we're thinking about it right now. And obviously, this is a little bit of a moving target with MISO, but we're thinking an announcement in the first part of next year. But like I said, that has the potential to shift as we've seen. And we're expecting kind of the next tranche or tranche 2 to be as big at lease as tranche 4, potentially bigger. And as we think about it, we'd expect a similar share as we received in tranche 1. So that's where our thoughts are today. But obviously, working with MISO and the stakeholders as we move through the process.Jeremy Bryan TonetGot it. That's helpful. Last one for me. Just didn't know if you might be able to elaborate a little bit more on the hydrogen hub now that the applications are in, just any incremental thoughts you could share with us would be great.Robert C. FrenzelIt's Bob. Thanks for the question. We -- look, I think as we think about the future and the future of hydrogen, I think the country really needs as we think about decarbonization across the economy, why we need a clean molecule for some of those harder to decarbonize sectors and hydrogen appears to be the most versatile of the clean energy molecules that we've been looking at. Certainly, the Department of Energy supports that through the hydrogen hub programs and in the IIJA. So we're excited about the application process. We expect decisions by end of year, where then we would go into future proposals around the proceedings.So we have two, one in the Rocky Mountain region, one in the upper Midwest region, both are consortiums with our multiple states and both involve the goal of creating what I think about as an ecosystem of both producers and users of a clean molecule like hydrogen and whether that can then be converted into fertilizer for ag, process heat -- burning for process heat and from our perspective, blending into the distribution system and co-firing in our existing natural gas plants. So we're excited around the versatility that the molecule provides. We appreciate what Congress and DOE are doing, and we look forward to progressing our applications at the DOE this year.Brian J. Van AbelYes. And I'll just add a little bit of more color on the process. I think overall, there is about 80 concept papers that were submitted, and DOE encouraged 33 concept papers and all 3 of ours were encouraged. Ultimately, as Bob said, we've moved forward with 2 because 2 were in the Rocky Mountain region. But we feel good about our, call it, multi-application hydrogen hubs and multistate hubs. So looking forward to seeing this process play out and as Bob said, awards at the end of the year, and then it's a stage process going forward after that.OperatorWe'll now take question from Sophie Karp calling from KeyBanc.Sophie Ksenia KarpJust a quick follow-up on the RFP process. Could you remind us if you're also bidding into those? And what do you expect your win rates to be, if any?Brian J. Van AbelSophie. Yes, thanks for the follow-up question. We do -- so the way we see this playing out is we have absolutely submitted our own self-bid -- self-build projects in all 3 of the RFPs, Minnesota, Colorado and SPS. And those range from solar to wind and storage and combinations of each of those and depends on the RFP. Minnesota was only a solar RFP. But we've spent probably the last 18 to 24 months, working on our self-build projects. As we know, we have a massive renewable build-out over the next decade in our territories. So -- not only do we see potentially our own self-build projects being selected, we have a good partnership with Vestas in the Colorado with their Colorado facility.And so we have some geographical advantages with having wind turbine -- wind blades being manufactured there, and we have a lot of opportunities around. We're using the interconnection of our retiring coal plants. So we feel really good. Now, publicly, we talk about targeting 50% ownership. Obviously, we think we'll be very cost competitive and would love to demonstrate to our commissions that we could do more than 50% ownership because we think we have really good projects that will show a lot of benefit to our customers. And I think this is just -- as I think about this, let me give you a little view of longer-term. I really think this is a start of steel for fuel 2.0 as we think about it.And I don't think there are many utilities can do this clean energy transition at the price point that we can because of the solar and wind resources in our backyard. And we think that's a true competitive advantage over the longer term as being able to deliver 80% to 85% clean energy in 2030 at or below inflation. So we're excited to continue to work on these RFPs. And following these RFPs, we'll do multiple more RFPs in our jurisdictions. So I'm looking forward to giving you and everyone on this call and our stakeholders further updates as we work through the process.Sophie Ksenia KarpPerfect. And then as a follow-up, maybe on the O&amp;M. I see that the O&amp;M has been a drag about like $0.06 maybe in the first quarter. Just wondering if that was impacted maybe by Monticello outage and repairs to a larger degree? And how do you see the shape of the O&amp;M through the rest of the year?Brian J. Van AbelYes. Thanks for the question. No, Monticello -- Monticello maybe a couple of million dollars from a repair cost perspective. So pretty immaterial relative to the quarter. As we think about it, last year, if you look at our pattern of O&amp;M last year, it was significantly higher in the latter part of the year. Part of that is due to some regulatory deferrals that were in place of Q1 last year than unwound as we got rates in Texas. And then we also had good weather last year, so we invested in our system later in the year.So as we think about it, we're still good with our year-end guidance, and we'll continue to work on that. Now that being said, we are facing inflationary pressures and it's something that we're very focused on internally is keeping those O&amp;M expenses down as I think is important from a customer build perspective long term. But overall, we feel good with where we are and expect to deliver on our year-end numbers as we've done for 18 years.OperatorNext, we'll go to [Mr. Gregg Orrill] of UBS.Unidentified AnalystJust a clarification around the transferability. Is it sort of the legal basis that you're looking for? Getting the clarification enables you to move forward. Or is there something that you're looking for in terms of the content?Brian J. Van AbelNot at all in terms of the content. I would call it we're looking for more administrative guidance. Now there may be other parties that are involved in tax equity partnerships or ITC, but we're looking at transferring PTCs, as I said, we're very clean from a transferability perspective. So it's more like okay, what are the registration requirements and then just our counterparties want to see the guidance too, so they know what they need to do. So nothing of our concern beyond just getting those administrative requirements out and that's why we're waiting, and we'll be ready to pull the trigger when we give that guidance.OperatorThe next question is coming from Ryan Levine calling from Citigroup.Ryan Michael LevineOn New Mexico, can you give some color as to what you're seeing in that regulatory process and compared to how the processes were with the prior commission? And is there any potential for settlement or change to the Q4 guidance, given the ramp-up of the new commission staff?Brian J. Van AbelRyan, thanks for the question. As we think about it in New Mexico, a wide range of intervenor testimony. I think some of that from large industrials is call it par for the course. Look at the staff testimony, we think it's a good starting point, the staff testimony. I think one of the key aspects is we filed the forward test year. And I think there's support from a forward test year construct perspective, which is different from historical standards. So absolutely, just got the testimony in last Friday, have digested it, and then we'll see if there is an opportunity to work with the parties and reach a balanced and constructive outcome from a settlement perspective.If you look at the schedule we have -- hearings are June 20. And so that would be kind of from now until June 20, and it's actually a stipulation period in their native, in terms of looking at settlement opportunities. But we've been -- we've reached a settlement in our last couple of rate cases in New Mexico and certainly look forward to working with the parties on it to get a balanced outcome for our customers. The second part of your question was around guidance. This goes into effect late in the year, so relatively small impact on 2023 guidance.Ryan Michael LevineOkay. But is the fourth quarter '23 decision, do you think that there's any risk to that timeline, from a regulatory timeline...Brian J. Van AbelNo. From a timeline perspective, no, I do not. In terms of it getting pushed out.Unidentified Company RepresentativeI mean, Ryan, the schedule has already moved out a month. So we think it's fine the way it is.Ryan Michael LevineOkay. And then on New Mexico, what are you seeing for weather-normalized load for that region?Brian J. Van AbelSo I think overall, in SPS, if you looked at our sales is very strong sales on -- particularly on the C&amp;I side, right? We had 7% plus C&amp;I sales quarter -- year-over-year for the quarter. Resi sales were up about 3%. Now that was higher than expectations on the residential side. Commercial side was pretty much in line with what we expected. So really strong growth, and more of that growth is weighted towards New Mexico than Texas with what we're seeing in the oil patch region in the Delaware Basin. Now rigs are up about 10% year-over-year from the rig count in the 2 counties we serve, Eddy and Lee.And then we're also seeing a lot of electrification requests as the large oil and gas customers have their own carbon reduction targets hitting and they're obviously working with the state of New Mexico is how they can improve their overall carbon footprint. So really good growth there, and we're doing everything we can and working with our customers to make sure that we can support them with the distribution and transmission investments that we need to make.OperatorOur next question is coming from Mr. Paul Patterson calling from Glenrock Associates.Paul PattersonCan you hear me?Robert C. FrenzelYes, Paul.Paul PattersonSo just back to the Colorado bill, I apologize if I wasn't -- if I just didn't get this but are you guys -- I mean the bill is moving pretty quickly. Are you guys -- I mean, with the amendments that were done on Tuesday, are you guys okay with it at this point? Or do you look for additional changes in it? I apologize if you guys actually addressed this earlier.Robert C. FrenzelPaul, it's Bob. I didn't comment earlier but no new concerns there. We -- the bill as it passed the Senate and the amendments that were provided make the bill workable, I think, from our perspective. We continue to watch it as it moves through the house process. But as it stands right now, I think it's something that we can work with. We think if there still leaves a lot at the commission for decision-making, and we would very much work with the CPUC and the staff to implement some of that legislation through the regulatory process.Paul PattersonOkay. Great. And then given some of your management experience in California, and their sort of more novel idea of the commission -- the company's proposal to bill -- at least a part of the bill associated with income. I'm just wondering if that's something that you guys have thought about in any of your jurisdictions. But particularly Colorado given the experience in California. And just if you have sort of any feedback or any thoughts you might have about that.Robert C. FrenzelYes. Thanks, Paul. I think you're talking about stratification of residential customers from an income perspective. I think at this point, what we do in that regard is we direct a lot of assistance through regulatory state and federal agency programs to mitigate the income-qualified customers. And that process, I think, has worked pretty well. I don't see us proposing any changes to customer stratification at this point.OperatorAs we have no further questions, at this time, I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Brian Van Abel for any additional closing remarks. Thank you.Brian J. Van AbelThanks, everyone, for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions.OperatorThank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's conference. Thanks for your attendance. You may now disconnect. Have a good day. Goodbye.]"

108,2d09c0d7-6612-338e-913b-c47b22b41d8d,XEL,2023-04-28,4 Stocks to Watch From the Promising Electric Power Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-watch-promising-electric-141702318.html,1682605022,STORY,"['NEE', 'XEL', 'ED', '^GSPC']","[The Zacks Utility – Electric Power industry stocks have been transitioning toward clean sources of fuel and focusing on lower carbon emissions. The introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act 2022 should support the industry’s transition toward clean energy sources to produce electricity. Utilities are also focused on strengthening the grid as well as transmission and distribution infrastructure. The huge infrastructure of the utilities faces the impact of the hurricane season each year. Infrastructure enhancement around the year increases the resilience of the entire system, reduces outages and allows operators to restore power quickly for customers affected by storms.NextEra Energy NEE, with large renewable operations and well-chalked-out capital investments to strengthen infrastructure, offers an excellent opportunity to stay invested in the utility space. Other utilities worth adding to your portfolio include American Electric Power AEP Xcel Energy XEL  and  Consolidated Edison ED.About the IndustryThe Utility – Electric Power industry involves the process of generation, transmission, distribution, storage and sale of electricity to customers. A substantial portion of utilities’ earnings is generated from regulated operations. Unless there is any major weather variation or unprecedented incidents, such as the coronavirus pandemic, demand for the services provided by utilities remains more or less steady, regardless of economic cycles. A clear transition is evident in this industry, with more companies declaring zero-emission goals on their own. Research and development over the years have resulted in a substantial decline in the cost of setting up utility-scale renewable power projects, aiding in the reduction of emissions. However, the ongoing increase in interest rates is a concern for capital-intensive utilities.3 Electric Power Industry Trends to Watch Out ForTransition Toward Cleaner Sources to Generate Power:  The operators in the U.S. electric power sector are gradually moving toward cleaner sources of energy to produce electricity. Per EIA, the annual share of U.S. electricity generation from renewable energy sources will rise from 22% in 2022 to 24% in 2023 as a result of the continuing addition of solar and wind-generating capacity. EIA expects total solar, wind generation and battery storage addition from the end of 2022 to the end of 2024 to be 77 gigawatts (GW). The expansion of renewable energy continues to eat into the share of coal in electricity generation. EIA expects coal contribution to electricity generation to fall from 20% in 2022 to 17% annually in the 2023-2024 period. The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will support and accelerate the utilities’ transition toward clean energy sources. IRA has removed the uncertainties relating to federal incentives provided for renewable sources usage. The act entails an opportunity for a wide range of low-cost clean energy solutions in a predictable way for a long time and will create earnings visibility. Courtesy of IRA, the utility operators are planning to add more renewable assets to their generation portfolio and shut down old polluting units. Per EIA, from 2022 end through 2024, 11 GW of coal-fired units will retire in the United States.Demand for Electricity Stable: Per EIA, electricity consumption in the United States can drop 1.1% in 2023 and nearly 1.6% in 2024. EIA believes that the expected drop in demand for electricity this year will be due to a milder summer forecast that would lead to less requirement for cooling. Despite the expected drop in consumption, the utilities will continue to add new renewable energy assets to the total generation portfolio.Story continuesOngoing Interest Rate Increase is a Concern: Utilities, to maintain, upgrade and expand operations, approach capital markets for loans. The utilities have been enjoying near-zero interest rates for the past few years. But multiple rate hikes in 2022 pushed up interest rates. In March 2023, the Federal Reserve again raised interest rates by 25 percentage points, taking the benchmark rate to a range of 4.75-5%. The increasing interest rates are a concern for capital-intensive utilities in the United States as these will push up capital servicing costs substantially from the current levels. U.S. utilities are currently spending a substantial amount on developing an advanced electricity network and strengthening infrastructure. Utilities might try to pass on the burden of increasing borrowing costs to customers but the necessary increase in rates might not get approved by the commission. In such a scenario, the utilities will need to digest the extra expenses, which can lower their profitability and make them less attractive to investors interested in the utility space.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates strong near-term prospects. The 56-stock Utility-Electric Power industry is housed within the broader Zacks Utilities sector and currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #88, which places it in the top 35% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

A quarter ago, it was expected that this utility would post earnings of $0.69 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.69, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.Xcel , which belongs to the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, posted revenues of $4.08 billion for the quarter ended March 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.91%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.75 billion.

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Xcel: mixed.

111,cfbe45bb-9c21-39ad-a324-78612fe68cf3,MNST,2023-04-28,25 Largest Beverage Companies in the Word in 2023,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/25-largest-beverage-companies-word-072323821.html,1682666603,STORY,"['KO', 'DEO', 'KDP', 'BF-B', 'STZ', 'PEP', 'MNST', 'ABEV', 'CABGY']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 25 largest beverage companies in the world in 2023. For more companies, head on over to 5 Largest Beverage Companies in the Word in 2023. These days, the biggest worry on everyone's mind is a potential recession in America. The economic turmoil that has been ravaging the world over the past couple of years has nearly destroyed the finances of developing countries and put advanced economies under strain as well. Take the example of China, where millions of fresh graduates with advanced degrees are struggling to find a job as the economy slowly starts after shutting down during the pandemic.At the same time, in the U.S. there is a growing worry of a potential default as the economy slows down in the wake of the Federal Reserve's rapid interest rate hikes to combat inflation. While members of the House were quick to pass a Republican sponsored bill in late April 2023 by voting two thirds to suspend normal rules, there are concerns that a showdown in Senate could very well place the U.S. on a default trajectory.But why bring up macroeconomics in a post about the biggest beverage companies in the world? Well, this is because the beverages sector is often quite resilient in a recessionary environment. Of course, the key word to note here is recession 'resistant' and not recession 'proof', since no industry is truly and absolutely immune to a drop in incomes and a slowdown in spending. Looking at what the professionals are saying, a study from Morningstar provides some important insights on this topic.In the aftermath of the 2008 economic crisis, Morningstar reported that the beverage industry was undervalued with an average value to fair price estimate of 0.88. It also highlighted that as spending fell, consumers became more price conscious which in turn saw the alcoholic beverages offered by Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) grow their sales. Additionally, other large companies such as Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) and Brown-Forman Corporation (NYSE:BF-B) were cash flow healthy. At the same time, brand loyalty also helped the beverage firms stay afloat, as Morningstar points out that brands such as Diageo's Johnnie Walker endured the recession well as customers continue to drink the spirit even as they canceled vacations.Story continuesAs a whole though, the beverages industry is made of both alcoholic and non-alcoholic products. In fact, the top five of the 16 Most Valuable Beverage Brands in the World are all non-alcoholic brands, and some of the biggest companies in the world such as The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) also make and sell non-alcoholic drinks. Naturally, since the current economic turmoil has been in place for over a year now, it's relevant to take a look at how well these companies are performing. On this front, Coca-Cola has recovered its revenue drop since the coronavirus pandemic and has grown top line sales since 2020. In fact, last year's inflationary wave also helped the beverage company, since it grew its revenue to $43 billion in 2022 from the $38.6 billion that it had raked in the previous year.Taking a look at the beverage industry as a whole, a research report from The Business Research Company estimates that the industry was worth $3.5 trillion last year, and despite the expected global slowdown, will grow to $3.7 trillion by the end of this year to mark a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.7%. It adds that from 2023 until 2027, the growth will decelerate a bit to sit at 5.4%, which will lead to a final value of $4.6 trillion for the global beverage market by the end of the forecast time period.Since it is one of the, if not the, biggest beverage companies in the world, a brief look at Coca-Cola's latest earnings call provides valuable details for what to expect from the beverages market. During the event, executives shared:Firstly, as John said, we feel confident about our outlook to drive the year [2023] from the top line. Let me connect that perhaps starting to 2022. As we commented, we saw steady volume growth through the year, including the fourth quarter. I know we reported a headline number of minus one. But if you accommodate the suspension of Russia and the COVID restrictions in China and take a three-year CAGR of volume growth, you see a pretty constant growth momentum through the year. And we would also comment that, that growth momentum has continued into the beginning of inflation. So we see strong underlying volume momentum or ongoing volume momentum that we have been able to achieve by our focus on the marketing innovation, the RGM and the execution to accommodate the need for affordability and premiumization in the phase inflation.And as John commented, we do see both inflation moderating as we go through 2023 and of course, our own pricing PMO beginning to moderate as we go through ’23 in part because, the input costs inflation is moderating, but also because we begin to cycle some of the price increases from 2022. And what that’s likely to net out as obviously, we’ve given a seven to eight for the full year. And what we’re likely to see is the beginning of the Q1, we’re likely to see revenue growth more close to what — the sort of levels we were achieving coming out of last year. And that then logically, the organic growth rate moderates as we get towards the end of the year, looking to close out on a more normalized level of revenue growth. And then when you average that out, you get to the seven to eight.se deWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the biggest beverage companies in the world, out of which the top players are The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Kweichow Moutai Co., Ltd.

112,7ce7a490-1895-3d22-9ddc-740d37881845,MNST,2023-04-28,Monster Beverage (MNST) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/monster-beverage-mnst-earnings-expected-140302529.html,1682604182,STORY,['MNST'],"[The market expects Monster Beverage (MNST) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis energy drink maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.34 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +21.4%.Revenues are expected to be $1.69 billion, up 11.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.02% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Monster Beverage?For Monster Beverage, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.51%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Monster Beverage will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Monster Beverage would post earnings of $0.31 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.29, delivering a surprise of -6.45%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Monster Beverage doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Southwest Airlines is who I'm talking about. Down about 3% off the back of its latest quarterly results. The budget airliner posted a $159 million loss in its first quarter. That was more than expected. It was to blame that huge holiday travel mess it had when thousands of flights were canceled between Christmas and the beginning of this year. They thought it was behind them, or you may have thought it was, but I know it's not.Another hurdle. The Justice Department is now tag teaming with the Department of Transportation, investigating whether it has given timely reimbursements to affected passengers, among other things it is investigating.- CEO Bob Jordan has his hands full. A lot of the problems there are not of his making, but they are his to clean up. And Boeing is adding to those issues. They expected to deliver 90 737s. They're having to cut that number to 70 because of Boeing's supply chain issues. And they're going to have to moderate hiring because of that. They're probably going to have to cancel flights because of that. One more problem.Second straight year Southwest Airlines is rated the worst airline in the country by WalletHub. They rated 11 domestic airlines--- They're not the worst.- --and it was easy for them to rank Southwest 11 out of 11. And they were the only one to measure 0 in two safety-related categories. There is a lot to clean up there at Southwest.- There certainly is a lot. And Bob Jordan was doing an interview earlier today, and he did say while he is confident, bookings have improved, he thinks Southwest is moving past it. But they do have more work to do in order to restore some of the confidence that was lost among the consumers. But even with all of that, when you take a look at their demand numbers, it was a pretty strong report. People are still flying Southwest. Despite all the issues that they have had over the last several months, their demand numbers are numbers that they are selling here. Right around the numbers that we saw pre-pandemic. So when you take into account all their issues here, they're still selling tickets, doing it at higher prices.- I love Southwest. I'm surprised they did so poorly on WalletHub. I mean, have you flown Spirit? Sorry.]"

(LUV) reported first-quarter 2023 loss of 27 cents per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 21 cents. In the year-ago reported quarter, LUV had reported a loss of 32 cents per share.LUV had to bear the first quarter of 2023 loss due to the unfavorable financial impacts of almost $380 million pre-tax, or $294 million after-tax, related to the December 2022 operational disruption. The majority of this impact was backed by an unfavorable revenue impact of almost $325 million due to cancelations of holiday return travel and a decline in bookings for January and February 2023 travel. Despite that, travel demand and revenue trends in March 2023 remained solid, which resulted in profitability for the month and record first-quarter revenues.Revenues of $5,706 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,741.4 million but improved 21.6% year over year.Operating StatisticsAirline traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles, jumped 11.6% year over year to 29.54 billion in the quarter under review. Capacity or available seat miles (ASMs) climbed 10.7% year over year to 38.06 billion. The load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) improved to 77.6% from 77% in the year-ago quarter.Passenger revenue per available seat mile (a key measure of unit revenues) ascended 11.5% year over year to 13.41 cents. Revenue per available seat mile improved 9.8% to 14.99 cents.Operating Expenses &amp; IncomeIn the first quarter, Southwest incurred an operating loss (as reported) of $284 million compared with an operating loss of $151 million in the year-ago period. On an adjusted basis (excluding special items), the company reported an operating loss of $284 million compared with a loss of $135 million. Total adjusted operating expenses (excluding profit sharing, special items, fuel and oil expenses) increased 17.3%.Fuel cost per gallon (inclusive of fuel tax: economic) rose 38.7% to $3.19. Consolidated unit cost or cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel, oil and profit-sharing expenses, and special items increased 5.9% year over year.Story continuesLiquiditySouthwest Airlines ended the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $8,359 million compared with $9,492 million at the end of December 2022. As of Mar 31, 2023, the company had long-term debt (less current maturities) of $7,999 million compared with $8,046 million at the end of December 2022.LUV generated $706 million of cash from operating activities in the reported quarter, while CapEx was $1,046 million.Q2 &amp; Full-Year OutlookFor second-quarter 2023, ASMs are estimated to improve 14% from the year-ago reported figure. Economic fuel costs per gallonare expected to be $2.45 to $2.55. LUV expects CASM, excluding fuel, oil and profit-sharing expenses, and special items, to increase 5-8% in the second quarter from the comparable period in 2022. Interest expenses are expected to be $65 million in the second quarter.For 2023, Southwest now expects capacity to improve 14-15% (prior view: up 15-16%) from the 2022 level. Economic fuel costs per gallon are now estimated between $2.60 and $2.70 (prior view: $2.65 and $2.75). CASM, excluding fuel, oil and profit-sharing expenses, and special items, is anticipated to decrease 2-4% (prior view: down 3.5-5.5%) in 2023 from 2022.Interest expenses are still expected to be $250 million in 2023.

Hunt Transport Services, Inc.’s JBHT first-quarter 2023 earnings of $1.89 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.04 and declined 17.5% year over year.JBHT’s total operating revenues of $3,229.58 million also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,434.4 million and fell 7.4% year over year. The downfall was due to declines in the volume of 25% in Integrated Capacity Solutions (ICS), 5% in Intermodal (JBI) and 17% in Final Mile Services (FMS), and a 17% decline in revenue per load in Truckload (JBT). Revenue declines in ICS, JBI, FMS and JBT were partially offset by Dedicated Contract Services revenue growth of 13%.JBHT’s total operating revenues, excluding fuel surcharges, decreased 10.2% year over year.Delta Air Lines’ DAL first-quarter 2023 earnings (excluding 82 cents from non-recurring items) of 25 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 29 cents.

The company’s current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products. Since 2008, PMI has invested more than USD 10.5 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies. In November 2022, PMI acquired Swedish Match – a leader in oral nicotine delivery – creating a global smoke-free champion led by the companies’ IQOS and ZYN brands. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized versions of PMI’s IQOS Platform 1 devices and consumables and Swedish Match’s General snus as Modified Risk Tobacco Products (MRTPs). As of March 31, 2023, PMI's smoke-free products were available for sale in 78 markets, and PMI estimates that approximately 18.5 million adults around the world had already switched to IQOS and stopped smoking. Smoke-free products accounted for approximately 35% of PMI’s total 2023 first-quarter net revenues. With a strong foundation and significant expertise in life sciences, PMI announced in February 2021 its ambition to expand into wellness and healthcare areas and, through its Vectura Fertin Pharma business, aims to enhance life through the delivery of seamless health experiences.

The Roper Technologies Conference Call will now begin. Today's call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I would like to turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Zack MoxceyGood morning, and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the first quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jason Conley, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Brandon Cross, Vice President and Principal Accounting Officer; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. Now if you please turn to Page 2. We begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now please turn to Page 3. Today, we will discuss our results primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP and continuing operations basis. For the first quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and the financial impacts associated with our minority investment in Indicor. Reconciliations can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. And now if you please turn to Page 4, I'll hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?Story continuesLaurence Neil HunnThanks, Zack, and we hope everyone is doing well this morning. We're looking forward to sharing our Q1 results with you, which were quite good. As we turn to Page 4, let's look at today's agenda. We'll start with our enterprise highlights and financial results, then turn to our segment-specific discussion and wrap up discussing our raised 2023 enterprise guidance. So with that, let's go ahead and get started. Next slide, please. As we turn to Page 5, the three main takeaways for today's call are, first, the year is off to a strong operational and financial start as our higher-quality, enhanced portfolio is obviously performing really well; second, we're increasing our full year guidance both in terms of organic revenue growth and adjusted DEPS; and third, we continue to be very well positioned for disciplined capital deployment. As it relates to our first takeaway, a strong start to the year, we saw total revenue grow 15% and organic revenue grow 8%. Consistent with our long-standing strategy, we continue to not only scale our enterprise but also simultaneously improve its underlying quality and recurring revenue base. Importantly, we had very strong cash flow performance with free cash flow margins in excess of 30%. Our results this quarter are another proof point that our higher-quality, less cyclical portfolio was purpose-built to consistently perform at a very high level. Finally, and also during the quarter, we held our first ever Roper Leadership Summit, where we had our 27 business unit presidents together and shared best practices and learnings across a variety of topics, including strategy development, strategy enablement and team and talent. While honoring our high trust autonomous model, the operating and corporate teams left feeling a true sense of community. It was a terrific week. Given the strong start to the year, we're increasing our full year organic growth outlook 100 basis points from 5% to 6% to 6% to 7% and increasing our full year DEPS guidance to be to be $16.10 to $16.30 or $0.15 at the midpoint. Our previous DEPS guide was $15.90 to $16.20. And finally, we continue to be well positioned relative to capital deployment. We remain quite active in the market as we evaluate an actively diligent many high-quality opportunities. Jason, I'll turn the call over to you so you can walk through our first quarter results and our strong financial position. Jason?Jason P. ConleyThanks, Neil, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. Turning to Slide 6. We're very pleased with how Q1 shaped up. Revenue came in at $1.47 billion or 15% over prior year. This was through a combination of strong organic growth of 8% and an 8% contribution from acquisitions, led by Frontline, and this was slightly offset by a 1% FX headwind. Growth was broad-based across the segments and a little better than expected. Broadly speaking, customer demand was favorable in the quarter, and order pipelines remain strong. EBITDA was $582 million or 15% of our prior year with margins roughly flat and in line with expectations. DEPS of $3.90 was up 19% over prior year and $0.06 above the high end of our guidance range of $3.80 to $3.84. Free cash flow of $445 million was 4% higher than prior year In our Q4 earnings call, we highlighted a $45 million settlement of a patent dispute for certain Verathon sales dating back to 2004. We paid that this quarter, so adjusted for the settlement, free cash would be 33% of revenue and up 14% over prior year. We saw very good cash performance, especially in our software businesses. Our Q1 renewals and related collections came in strong as expected. As I mentioned last quarter, Frontline will collect most of their renewals in the third quarter. So it's a bit of a drag on conversion in the first half. So overall, just a really great start to 2023. Now turning to Slide 7, we'll spin through our balance sheet. Coming off solid Q1 cash flow performance, our balance sheet continues to strengthen. Gross debt was around $6.7 billion, and our cash balance has grown to just under $1.2 billion, which yields net debt just shy of $5.5 billion. This puts our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio at 2.4, which was down from 2.7 at year-end. This, coupled with our undrawn revolver of $3.5 billion gives us capacity to deploy $4 billion or more in the near term. To that end, we've been quite active in 2023, evaluating a number of platform and bolt-on opportunities. As always, we will remain disciplined and patient in our capital deployment process. With that, I'll turn it back over to Neil, to talk about our segment performance and outlook. Neil?Laurence Neil HunnThanks, Jason. Let's turn to Page 9 and walk through our Q1 highlights for Application Software segment. Revenues here were $761 million, up 6% on an organic basis, and EBITDA margins were 43.2%. Performance in this segment was strong across the board. To highlight a few of our business' performance, we'll start with Deltek. Deltek was solid. As we mentioned last quarter, Deltek did see some slower customer decision-making, but that was largely rectified this quarter. Deltek had double-digit bookings in the quarter with strength across both enterprise class and SMB-sized customers as well as government contracting and private sector solutions. As usual, both gross and net retention at Deltek remain strong and consistent with recent history. Aderant, our software business focused on the needs of law firms, continues to compete and win and take share from our competitors. In the quarter, Aderant experienced record bookings and continued success in the adoption of their SaaS solutions. Great job by Chris, Rafi and the entire Aderant team. Vertafore, our software business at tech-enabled property and casualty insurance agencies, posted another solid quarter and continues to perform quite well for us. Of particular note, Vertafore recent acquisition of MGA Systems, a software solution targeted to manage general agents, or MGAs, is proving to be highly strategic and bookings activity is tracking ahead of plan. Frontline continues to perform quite well for us in the first couple of quarters of ownership. Frontline's mission is to empower the front line of education. As many of you know, hiring of teachers and administrative staff is particularly challenging, and Frontline software solutions better equip K-12 school districts to navigate these challenges. Because of this, frontline solutions are mission-critical and of high importance to their school district customers. For the segment, EBITDA margins were down 90 basis points year-over-year, in line with our expectations. Our Acute Care software businesses, especially CliniSys, Data Innovations and Strata are ramping up their implementation capacity based on recent bookings momentum. We expect to see similar margins in Q2. Looking to the balance of the year, we expect to see organic growth in the mid-single-digit area for this segment based on our leading market positions and growth in recurring revenue. Turning to Page 10. Revenues in the quarter for a Network Software segment were $355 million, up 6% on an organic basis, and EBITDA margins were strong at 53.1%. As with our Application Software segment, growth and performance was broad-based across this segment. Relative to business-specific comments, we'll start with our U.S. and Canadian freight matching businesses, DAT and Loadlink, which both grew nicely in the quarter. While freight market conditions are softer than this time last year, our businesses in this space are critical to the operation and execution of the spot freight market. In addition and importantly, the spot market is a long-term secular beneficiary in terms of the volume of future freight shipments. Throughout and across the freight and economic cycle, DAT and Loadlink continue to innovate and launch new products and offerings to help drive enhanced customer value and share of wallet. with the current product strategy focused on tech enabling the connectivity between brokers and carriers. iPipeline, our network software business that tech enables the distribution channel for life insurance and annuities, is coming off a terrific 2022 and continued its high level of execution this quarter with very strong bookings, retention and customer expansions. Foundry continued its string of strong performance in the quarter and had terrific seat growth for their flagship product Nuke , which enabled continued double-digit recurring revenue growth. As we mentioned last quarter, Foundry commenced their subscription pricing transition for Nuke and in Q1 had north of 50% of the Nuke seats sold under their new model ahead of their plan. Finally, our alternate site health care businesses, MHA, SoftWriters and SHP were strong in the quarter. Execution was solid, and the business has benefited by an improving census in skilled nursing, assisted living facilities and home health reaching the highest occupancy levels and patient volumes since the onset of the pandemic. Turning to the balance of the year. We expect to see mid-single-digit organic growth for this segment based on broad and sustained growth across this group. As we turn to Page 11. Revenues in the quarter for our Tech-enabled Products segment were $354 million, up 14% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins for the segment were 34.7% in the quarter. Across the segment, business performance and execution was solid. Importantly, the broad-based supply chain issues continue to wane. Though we're not entirely out of the woods, we can now see a path to a more normalized supply chain environment. Neptune, our water meter and technology product business, continues to be just great. In the quarter, they had record revenue performance and set records for backlog levels. Importantly, Neptune continues to see increasing demand and momentum for their residential and commercial ultrasonic or static meters. We remain bullish on Neptune and the market in which they compete as this market tends to be quite steady as Neptune's customers' budgets are typically fixed year-to-year and not tied to broader macroeconomic trends or cycles. Great job at Neptune, and congrats. Verathon was strong in the quarter as well with double-digit order growth. Specifically, Verathon saw strength across the reoccurring single-use products, both bronchoscope or BFlex and video innovation or GlideScope as well as BladderScan capital purchases. Importantly, Verathon has four product launches scheduled for the next few months which will help continue their market share gains and momentum. Northern Digital NDI was also strong in the quarter and continued to see terrific demand for their optical and EM solutions. NDI's enabling measurement technology is used by scores and medical product OEMs and solutions such as robotic-assisted surgery and across multiple cardiac-specific modalities. NDI's high level of market focus and operational discipline will enable them to continue to be the market share leader for these measurement technologies long into the future. Our outlook for the balance of the year for this segment has improved to be in the low double-digit area and is based on continued strong orders and improving manufacturing productivity at Neptune as well as an improved growth outlook across our medical product businesses. Now please turn to Page 13. And let's review our increased 2023 guidance. For 2023, we expect total revenue growth to be north of 12%. In addition, we're updating our organic revenue growth outlook to be in the 6% to 7% range, an increase from our original guidance of 5% to 6%. As a result, we're increasing our DEPS guidance to be in the range of $16.10 and $16.30 up from our prior guidance of $15.90 to $16.20, assuming that this guidance is a tax rate in the 21% to 22% area. Specific to the second quarter, we're establishing our DEPS guidance is to be in the $3.96 to $4 range. Now please turn with us to Page 14, and then Jason and I will look forward to answering your questions. As we turn to Page 14, we want to leave you with the same three points with which we started. First, 2023 is off to a great start. We saw revenues increase 15% to $1.47 billion in the quarter. This growth was underpinned with 8% organic revenue growth and 8% recurring revenue growth. In addition, margins were quite strong. This quarter's financial and operational performance is yet another proof point of our capabilities, and frankly, the expectations of our improved higher-quality portfolio of businesses. Most importantly, our revenue growth translated to impressive cash flow growth with our underlying free cash flow growing 14%. As you know, we view cash flow growth as the best measure of performance. Second, based on the strong start to the year, the higher recurring nature of our revenue stream and the importance of our solutions to our customers, we are increasing our full year organic revenue growth outlook to be between 6% and 7% and increasing our full year DEPS to be between $16.10 an $16.30. Finally, we continue to be active with our capital deployment activities as we have north of $4 billion of available M&amp;A firepower. As we discussed during our Investor Day last month, we have a very large universe and pipeline of opportunities, though, as always, we remain super patient and highly disciplined to ensure optimal deployment of our available capital. Now as we turn to your questions and if you could flip to the final slide, our strategic flywheel, we want to thank those of you who joined us in New York or online last month for our first ever Investor Day. During that long-form overview of Roper, we are excited to share with you our long-term strategy, the high-quality nature of our portfolio of businesses, our operating ability to improve our businesses, our process-driven capital deployment approach and our compelling long-term business model that compounds cash flow in the mid-teens area. So thank you for your continued interest in Roper. And with that, let's open it up to your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.Deane Michael DrayIt was great to see everyone in New York last month. Just maybe we can start off, and it's a bit of a follow-up from last quarter with Deltek on some of the slowing in decision-making. This is kind of what everyone is watching, might there be any kind of fallout from bank turmoil or read through in to construction markets and so forth. But the idea of slower customer decision making, maybe just give us an update on how that played out, time to sign contracts, any new logos. Just any color there would be helpful.Laurence Neil HunnYes. Sure, Deane. Happy to talk about it. it's something that we spent a tremendous amount of time talking to our leadership teams, our group executives about, trying to understand the signal. To set the obvious context, we spent the last several years trying to really work out the cyclicality of the portfolio, and we're also in these very small niche markets where the customers tend to be not that cyclical. So the signal for us is faint. It's not nonexistent, but it's faint. Last quarter, we certainly talked about Deltek and them having some slower customer demand, as we said in the prepared comments, that largely, it's not fully rectified itself this most recent quarter. Two or three quarters ago, we talked about the same thing going on at PowerPlan, that rectified itself the subsequent quarter as well. Some of the other macro things that we listen to, the amount of property casualty insurance written as a sign of sort of business formation or business growth continued to grow, life insurance applications got steady. DAT, the number of carriers we expected and certainly have seen for a couple of quarters, carrier declines at touch. But that meaningfully moderated in Q1. So we continue to listen for it, but -- and we certainly have planned for the second half of the year, concern outlook relative to a slowdown. But the signal's faint at the moment. Jason, anything you want to add to that?Jason P. ConleyYes I would just say our software bookings were up high single digits year-over-year in the quarter. So that just put some math behind what Neil was saying.Deane Michael DrayGreat. That's really helpful, and appreciate kind of that walk through the portfolio there on sensitivity. And then just second question, it was nice to see the boost in organic revenue guides for the back of the year in tech-enabled products up low double digits. And just with the expectation, look, Neptune continues to do really well, and we see that in the industry. That tends to be a bit steady. So how is it that you're seeing this acceleration and must be also on the medical side, too?Laurence Neil HunnYes. There's three parts to this -- macro parts to this segment. There's Neptune, medical products and then a couple of small RF product businesses, all three, they have and -- we, at corporate, sort of increased the outlook for the balance of the year. Neptune has just continued incredible order growth and then terrific performance out of the factory at Neptune, which gives us confidence that they can chew into a little bit more of the backlog than we maybe originally thought coming into the year.At the medical product businesses, as we all know, last year, medical procedure volumes were down in the 7% to 8% range. We plan for that to continue this year. It's actually been a little bit better than that, and that flowed through at Verathon, CIVCO directly and less directly through NDI. And then the Inovonics and RF Ideas, the RF product businesses, have been riddled with supply chain challenges and coming into the year. We assume those would continue, and they meaningfully improved in Q1. So it's a little bit uplift across the board that gives us the confidence to take the guide up in that segment.OperatorThe next question is from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research.Scott Reed DavisI know it's not -- there isn't any particular business that's game changing for you in any particular quarter. But when you think about freight matching, and I know the truckers have had some tough time this quarter. Some of the guidance has been a little cautious, tough comps, et cetera. How linked is your freight matching business to kind of the miles driven and the B2C kind of truck market? Is there a direct link there? I would assume there is, but I'm just -- it doesn't seem like you had really any major problems in DAT this quarter.Laurence Neil HunnYes. DAT grew in the quarter. Year-over-year, it grew sequentially. So -- but there is a link. It's an indirect link. We're not paid per mile driven, we're not paid on any utilization metric. It's a fixed subscription on both the broker side and the carrier side. The reason DAT historically tends to be less cyclical than the market in which it operates, a couple of things. One is you have this tension between the cyclical nature and the secular growth driver, where the spot market is just winning more market share of the total freight volumes. So you have more volume generally coming into the spot market over the long arc of time. And the simple version for why that is, is because the spot market is becoming more liquid or easier to transact in as it tech enables itself, of which DAT is a participant and enabler of that. The second thing is understanding the dynamic between what the role the spot market plays in a booming versus a waning market, where in the -- and it's about the pricing dynamic between contract pricing and spot pricing. Spot pricing changes daily, contract pricing changes on a rolling year basis. And so when the market is very hot, you obviously have more demand for carriers and there is supply, rates go up in the spot market. It invites capacity addition. And that's what's driven DAT's growth for the last couple of three years as you have more carriers coming into the market. When the freight market slows, you actually have spot pricing below that of contract, and you actually, at that moment, start seeing some of the contract freight come into the spot market so the shippers can save money. So it provides you a floor for the demand of carriers. And so historically, DAT grows very nicely in upmarket and grows slower in the downmarket for those couple of reasons.Scott Reed DavisThat's interesting. Hate to climb in a [Manushya] here, but I'm just going to do it anyways. What's the -- how does this business change over time? Like does AI become a big enabler and a predictor and help kind of drive that liquidity that you talked about, Neil? How does technology, I guess, change the game and help you guys gain share over time, I think is a better question.Laurence Neil HunnYes. I mean -- there's a lot of tech currents and cross currents in this space. At the core of it, today, I still think on average, there's between 8 and 10 phone calls that go between a broker and a carrier to actually broker a load. Obviously, what we're all trying to do is take that to 0. DAT is a big part of their product road map is to tech enable that. So there's AI in the match, there's AI in the routing, there's AI in future trucks going from Cincinnati, Chicago, it's going to be there on Tuesday at 3. How does it have a pickup in Chicago back to where it wants to go four hours later or whatever the time frame is. There's a lot of AI that can go into that. But the principle, the true unlock for the industry is to take the -- make the match more efficient, and that's where most of the technology investment is going today.Scott Reed DavisOkay. That's helpful.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Terry Tillman with Truist.Terrell Frederick TillmanCongrats on the quarter. So the first question, I guess, is on the Frontline because that was the last major platform acquisition. I think you all talked about $370 million of revenue, expected contribution and $170 million EBITDA. And I think also you said it was a stub period, it was in the 80s and 4Q. What I'm curious about is how is it tracking to those targets. And I did notice they just announced a new HCM suite, there's a new CRO there. So it seems like there's some dynamic things going on. Just maybe double-clicking on Frontline, and then I had a follow-up for Jason.Laurence Neil HunnYou do the -- you take the first one.Jason P. ConleyYes. So they're tracking on their forecast. As you know, they're a business that has large renewals in the third and fourth quarter. And so we'll expect the business to tick up sequentially in the second half, but they are definitely on track for their revenue and EBITDA numbers of $370 million, $175 million.Laurence Neil HunnYes. And as it relates to the new products and a couple of new leaders, we're certainly excited to have Bill a new CFO, Scott, our new COO; and Curtis, the new Chief Client Operations Officer joined. It's often case not times the case. There's a few leadership changes that happen in the first year or so of ownership. And so that was expected, we're excited to have this team. It's an incredible group that's joined us.The thing that we -- that I'm particularly excited about and proud of in the first couple of quarters of ownership of Frontline is the strategic choice they've made. As a pattern we see from a lot of companies that come out of private equity is very limited choice that's made, so they try to do too many things and not do them well. And so very quickly, Frontline doubled down on client experience and R&amp;D productivity and actually made a choice to take a little bit of resource out of go-to-market, which makes complete sense when you have 85% or 90% coverage of the customers. And the entire strategy or the principle part of strategy is to focus on cross-selling, up-selling. You need to deliver a tremendous experience, hence, to focus on client experience and need to be able to innovate and sell them more products, hence the deployment to R&amp;D. So we love the choice that's been made there and excited for what that yields in the future.Terrell Frederick TillmanThat's great color. I guess just a follow-up for Jason is you were able to call out the adjustment from the settlement. So is up 14% in terms of the free cash flow at low 30s on a free cash flow margin. Should we think about that for the remainder of the year in terms of kind of that mid-teens growth and maintaining a low 30s free cash flow margin?Jason P. ConleyYes, that's right. We're on track to deliver north of 30% free cash flow. As I mentioned, the second half is going to be better than the first half with the renewals at Frontline. But yes, we're still on track there.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.Charles Stephen TusaA couple of the businesses that you guys didn't mention, but I think to Deane's question around what's going on out there. ConstructConnect, what are you seeing there? And then perhaps CliniSys, another one of your kind of big ones.Laurence Neil HunnSure. So ConstructConnect, as we talked about in the past, tends to be a countercyclical business. For those that are less familiar, ConstructConnect for simplicity has a near perfect database of every commercial construction project that's in the planning phase. And so if you're a general contractor, a trade contractor, a building product manufacturer, you're generally quite interested in understanding for planning purposes, for bidding a project purposes what's in the stage of development planning.When the construction market is white hot, general contractors and subs have more work that they can do. There's less utility and value in paying a subscription fee for future projects that are in the queue. When the amount of work starts to slow down, there is increased utility in that. So when I look back and back test ConstructConnect over a couple of cycles, it has a clear countercyclical demand behavior attached to it. So the market, we think, will be coming to it. As a general matter, ConstructConnect has maybe modestly underperformed our hopes. It's been more of a low single-digit growth business. Our expectation is that it should be mid. And we're quite confident with the current strategy that will climb to there and get to there. We have a great leader that came out from Deltek a couple of years ago, Matt Strazza, the operational discipline, the strategy, the go-to-market sort of prowess is just at the next level. And so we're quite confident that we're going to be able to reach our expectations of mid there. CliniSys is been nothing short of great. Simpson, who's been -- who has integrated the U.S. Sunquest business with the European business, has just done that almost without error. It's been terrific. The business grew. The combined business grew in the quarter. We haven't been able to say that for quite some time given the drag of the U.S. business. We continue to be just tremendously strong in the U.K. As you know, we're one of three or four strategic IT vendors to the NHS as we run something like 80% or 85% of the laboratory network in the U.K. The pan-European strength continues. For instance, we run the largest health system in France, in APHP, the Paris system. And in the U.S., some of the strength comes from the fact that we now have a product offering that is for laboratories outside of that of health care. So think environmental, toxicology, water, et cetera, which is showing some early signs of promise. And so a lot of congratulations to Simpson and Andy, the CFO, and we're excited to see what happens at Clinisys.Charles Stephen TusaGreat. And then just one last one on free cash flow. It's a very pretty strong quarter, upside surprise, at least versus what we were expecting. A little bit bigger of a drag from deferred, but maybe a bit lower cash taxes or something. Just talk about the moving parts there and how you expect that to trend sequentially over the next couple of quarters on free cash.Jason P. ConleySure. Yes, I can take that, Steve. So yes, the deferred revenue is down or, I guess, the consumption of cash in the first quarter because of Frontline, right? So they -- you'll see that spike back up in the third quarter with those renewals. It was, overall, deferred revenue outside of that was in line with expectations. It was fairly flat to the fourth quarter. And then on taxes, we typically make two tax payments: federal tax payments in the second quarter and then one in the third and one in the fourth. So we will expect Q2 to be down sequentially but up year-over-year. And then just for overall, for the full year, as I mentioned earlier, just north of 30% free cash flow margin, so on track there.Charles Stephen TusaYes. Great. And then sorry, just one last quick one. The high single-digit bookings number, was that an organic number for software?Laurence Neil HunnYes.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.Julian C.H. MitchellJust a question on tech-enabled products first. So you're seeing a lot of sort of hardware manufacturers in our group with a big kind of flush of revenue right now as component shortages ease, and then there's obviously a lot less visibility on the forward look once that flows through. So just wanted to tap -- very strong revenue performance in Q1. You're very confident in the sort of the next three quarters' outlook. Maybe just drill down a little bit more into sort of orders and backlog trends there, just kind of the confidence that the strength right now is sustainable through year-end and not just to kind of a flush as supply chain eases.Laurence Neil HunnYes. So it's something that we -- a couple of things we've been really quizzing and with our companies is two things, this very thing, and then also the stability of the backlog has there been any order fall out of the backlog, right? So there's been none, by the way -- virtually none on backlog order fallout. The orders are quite strong. Book-to-bill was greater than 1 in the quarter. So it gives us, I think, a good indication that it's not just a flush backlog. In terms of the balance of the year though, I mean, we're waiting for the time when -- a lot of what's happened across the whole complex, not just us, is order duration is extended, right, as customers that want to be in the queue to make sure they have supply. At some point, and at that point, I don't know -- I don't think any of us know what is going to happen, we're going to get back into a more normal order sort of duration timing. So there'll be a period of time when orders, because of timing, compress. It's -- we don't know when that's going to happen, but we're fully expecting it. And candidly, aren't going to be that worried about it because it's sort of a natural reaction to where we are. We also -- so that's commentary for Neptune in the whole segment. For medical products, quite the opposite. There isn't really -- we don't work out of a huge backlog out of that -- those businesses. And so that dynamic that you're addressing or questioning doesn't exist. And then for -- we really solved the supply chain challenges at the RF product businesses. They were bespoke and unique to the two businesses there. And so now we will be able to start clearing some backlog, but that's more of a second half thing than what it was in the quarter.Julian C.H. MitchellThat's very helpful. And then just circling back on one of the more potentially cyclical pieces within software, and it's already been touched on once or twice. But to try and put a finer point on the sort of DAT and Loadlinked businesses at Network Software. Within that sort of mid-single-digit growth outlook for the segment for the balance of the year, how -- what are you dialing in for sort of DAT or Loadlink? Not -- you don't have to give me the percentage number. Just curious sort of versus the segment growth of mid-single digit, for example.Laurence Neil HunnYes. So it's the same -- I'll give you a color to it. I think we'll stop short of giving you like specifics at a company level. But as we mentioned last quarter, there is a difference of opinion between the DAT leadership and Sarasota about what the outlook of this business is for the year. DAT is much more bullish on what the year -- the balance of the year is going to look like than what we are here in Sarasota.We continue to have a very conservative posture relative to what DAT looks like, especially uniquely on the carrier count for the balance of the year. We want to see -- while we had a nice proof point in Q1 that the carrier decline started to basically flatten, we have not assumed they continue from that level and improve. We continue -- we assume they actually get a little bit worse.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.Joseph Craig GiordanoSo just kind of talk about this on the medical product side, but we had another company talking about like big inventory levels of component parts in medical, like -- kind of like unexpectedly so. So like their customers just have some of their -- more of their products than anticipated. I'm guessing that's not really relevant to you guys, but I just wanted to ask the question.Laurence Neil HunnIt's not particularly relevant. There's one business, Northern Digital, correct me on this I think it's just -- principally one that sells through, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the medical product OEMs were a critical component, a necessary component to scores of these medical product OEMs. They cannot ship their product without our product, obviously. So there was -- we're worried there might have been a fair amount of inventory in the channel as buffer. The commentary from the Northern Digital team this quarter is they feel most if not all of that is through the system. It's hard to know exactly for sure, but that's where -- that's really the only place where it happens. Otherwise, it's us directly to a customer -- and in consumer customer.Joseph Craig GiordanoYes. That's what I figured. Okay. And then just a question on like the landscape for M&amp;A. Like I'm just curious, from -- for your competitors on the PE side who are looking at stuff, is like the -- I know rates are kind of all over. Is the volatility of rates and like the uncertainty around rates directionally like a problem for them? And like the ability to lock in debt or the desire to lock in rates, like is that having an impact on the market at all?Laurence Neil HunnYes. I mean, it's been slow. The number of deals printed in the last couple of quarters has been very low for this reason that you mentioned for the reason that there's just a bid-ask spread between buyers and sellers. -- that continues to exist. And then also just uncertainty on what the exit values are going to be. If you're doing a IRR analysis, the most sensitive variable and the whole thing is your exit value, your exit multiple. And so all in uncertainty, there just hasn't been a lot of deals or recaps. Private equity -- in private equity, there's been a handful of strategic deals that have happened. I'll tell you though, in this our pattern recognition history would say, in times of volatility, it creates opportunity. We saw that coming out of COVID. And very quickly, I mean, it was what, August-ish and 2020 when we did Vertafore, it was an opportunity for us. And so it's our commitment to investment-grade debt, our leverage levels that we could be nimble and flexible and quite opportunistic because this -- moments like this is where opportunities exist for a variety of reasons. So we're cautiously optimistic over the course of this year that those will present themselves.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.Allison Ann Marie Poliniak-CusicJust along the lines of that M&amp;A, I know you mentioned you have certainly have a pipeline platform versus bolt-ons. I guess just even what you're seeing today and sort of the comments that you just made, is there any confidence sort of you'd probably lean towards more bolt-ons in the next few months? Or are there some opportunities that you're seeing on the platform side that could execute?Laurence Neil HunnYes. I think it's -- we characterize the current near-term level of activity in the M&amp;A pipeline as having a bit more on the add-on or bolt-on side than what we might have seen historically. I wouldn't read too much into that. It sometimes -- it's just the way it falls sometimes. There's certainly a handful of platforms that we are currently evaluating. There always is a handful that were in pretty late stages or detailed work evaluating. But on balance, there's a bit more on the bolt-on side. Those tend to be our very best deals because they are additive to strategically to one of our existing companies. There's normally some synergies that come with those -- and as we talked about in the Investor Day, strategically, we'd like to see more of our capital deployed against the bolt-on strategy. But we're not going to force it, but it would be nice to be able to see it.Allison Ann Marie Poliniak-CusicGot it. That's helpful. And then Application Software, the capacity ramp in acute care. I know you mentioned, obviously, it's impacting Q2. How should we think about that, the balance of the year? When does that fully get running, that ramp?Jason P. ConleyYes, that's right. I mean, we thought EBITDA margins were in line with expectations in the first quarter, and we did have those implementations. Also, CBORD had some large integrated security pull-ins, they finally got some parts for some of those projects. But for the second quarter, we're expecting it to be about the same, and then it will pick back up in the second half. So you can expect EBITDA margins to be about flat year-over-year.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink with Baird.Joseph D. VruwinkHope you're well. One observation I just kind of what we're hearing in the broader environment. It does seem like the system of record companies for the industries you serve, they're holding up pretty well. And then I think there's some particular industry examples like K-12 education would be one where the spend is actually consolidating a bit around these companies, so share of wallet is going up right now. Do you think you're generally seeing this so far? And any examples that come to mind where you kind of look at your growth relative to underlying IT spend and this wallet share dynamic is maybe playing out?Laurence Neil HunnYes. I mean, I would say -- I mean, I have to -- we can take this off-line and sort of go company by company in some level of detail to the extent it would be interesting. But at the highest level, we would say yes, right? So we're -- we say in the Investor Day, we say in all of our communication that we're mission-critical software system of record sort of software. On the application side, if you think about like Deltek or Vertafore I mean, Frontline -- Aderant is a great example where we've gone from #2 to #1. We've doubled the size of the company over ownership period. The net retention has gone from like low 1-0 --, whatever, 102,103 so low 110s, 110, 112, I think, which just gives you a sense that all these software companies work for a long time to create a customer base that then they can spend the rest of their life cross-selling into. And so most of our -- all of our companies, 50% to 75% or more of their new bookings come from cross-selling, upselling. And the best example of that is the one you called out, which is Frontline, which I think it's like 80% plus, where it's -- they've done all the work over their history of basically capturing the customers and now it's about how do you get more share of wallet. And in Frontline's case, in particular, it's a more fragmented state-by-state based on the regulatory environment, competitive environment. And you're right, today, 50% of K-12 health systems -- or excuse me, education systems want to buy from a consolidated vendor, where five years ago, that number was 25% or 30%. So the market is coming towards -- in the education space towards companies like Frontline.Joseph D. VruwinkOkay. That's great. And then, I guess, a quick one on Frontline. In terms of the sequencing of free cash flow, so 50% cash flow margin business, do they typically kind of burn cash 1Q, 2Q, 4Q? And so 3Q, we can think of more than 50% of that business's full year generation is probably hitting in that time frame.Jason P. ConleyYes, I think that's the right way to think about it, Joe. A little bit more of a burn in Q2 -- Q1, a little less in Q2 and then a big cash inflow in Q3 and a little bit of cash in Q4.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Alex Blanton with Clear Harbor Asset Management.Alexander M. BlantonMost of my questions on your operations have been answered, but I wanted to ask about how the -- how you benefit from the sale of compressor controls. Like Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice, they sold it to Honeywell, they just announced this week for $670 million. Are they selling your piece? And do you get any cash from that?Laurence Neil HunnAlex, I appreciate the opportunity to talk about this. So we are certainly involved with it. We're 49% owners of Indicor. We have quarterly Board meetings. From the very first conversation we had with Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice about what the value creation plan is for Indicor, part of it was to do some portfolio work with this being the principal piece to make Indicor less oily and more industrial. And so this was a strategic -- this was an asset that was highly strategic to a number of folks in the industry. It was a very competitive process, and we're delighted to be able to sell the business for 19x this year's EBITDA. I think Honeywell is a great home for this business. That mattered a lot to us. The benefit of Indicor is we now get to take this capital as a company and a 49% owner of the company and then redeploy it to industrial and industrial tech type businesses build the M&amp;A flywheel and hopefully create the next great industrial compounder that will become a public company in three to five years. And that's when we'll monetize through the whole value creation plan.Alexander M. BlantonOkay. Do you get any cash from this deal?Jason P. ConleyThe only cash we get, Alex, is we'll have a distribution to us for the tax liability of the sale. But most of the cash is going to stay in the business. So we'll get that cash whenever it closes, sometime in the second half.OperatorThis concludes our question-and-answer session. We will now return back to Zack Moxcey for any closing remarks.Zack MoxceyThank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call.OperatorThat conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.]"

This compares to earnings of $3.77 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.30%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this industrial equipment maker would post earnings of $3.77 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.92, delivering a surprise of 3.98%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Roper Technologies , which belongs to the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry, posted revenues of $1.47 billion for the quarter ended March 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.92%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.53 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Roper Technologies shares have lost about 0.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 5.6%.What's Next for Roper Technologies?While Roper Technologies has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Roper Technologies: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future.

126,3fb913a0-1124-3d8f-85a6-39091c4ce49d,WU,2023-04-28,Analysts Estimate Envestnet (ENV) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-envestnet-env-report-140302198.html,1682604182,STORY,"['ENV', 'WU']","[Envestnet (ENV) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 4. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis financial services firm is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.44 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -6.4%.Revenues are expected to be $300.57 million, down 6.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.91% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Envestnet?For Envestnet, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.83%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Envestnet will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Envestnet would post earnings of $0.43 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.45, delivering a surprise of +4.65%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Envestnet doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, Western Union (WU), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.33 per share for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -35.3%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $998.67 million, down 13.6% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Western Union has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.38%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Western Union will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Very Cheap Stocks to Buy Right Now.Stock valuations are again a topic of discussion currently as some analysts are warning against the market’s optimism that is sending tech valuations soaring to record levels. While several analysts believe the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates just one more time in 2023 before hitting a temporary pause, there’s a section in the market that is hoping for rate cuts. This optimism is having a direct effect on the technology sector which looks great in the short term. The S&amp;P 500 Information Technology Index is up 23% in 2023, compared to a 7.7% gain of the broader S&amp;P 500 index in the same period. According to an analysis by Bloomberg, this was the IT sector’s strongest start to a year since 2009. However, this optimism is unfounded and could cause pain for investors in the coming weeks or months. The Bloomberg report said that tech stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are trading at about 25 times their prospective earnings.“To justify such a multiple, the Fed would need to cut rates by at least 300 basis points,” the report said, citing data from Bloomberg Intelligence.The report cited Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial, who said the following:“Traders are betting on a big about-face in the Fed’s interest-rate policy, but there is no certainty as to whether, and when, this will happen. Longer-term, the sector’s growth prospects are attractive, but not at the current valuations.”Data from Research Affiliates shows that valuations of US stocks are reaching extremely high levels.Research Affiliates looked at the CAPE ratio metric and found that the US stock benchmark trades at a multiple around 29, pricier than it has been more than 90% of the time since 1881.But not all sectors emit this euphoria. The banking sector, which was devastated by the collapse of multiple banks earlier this year, is still reeling from steep share price declines. Some analysts believe some bank stocks are offering attractive entry points since the fundamentals of several banks that are currently down remain strong.Story continuesBaird analyst David George recently said in a note that the sentiment around bank stocks has been “abysmal” over the past few weeks and “market participants seem to be pricing in permanent profitability destruction, which we think is unlikely.” The analyst said that the banking sector’s risk/reward is “very attractive following panic selling.” George believes these stocks have priced in a “catastrophe.”Best Very Cheap Stocks to Buy Right NowTechnology share chartOur MethodologyFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and picked 15 tech stocks with PE ratios less than 15 as of April 25.

Investors are concerned about legal liabilities associated with its antacid drug Zantac. While it is impossible to know the outcome with certainty, our preliminary assessment suggests that the decline in market capitalization exceeds the likely financial impact on the company.”14. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) is gaining after the company posted upbeat guidance for the fiscal first quarter.  Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) expects solid performance for its integrated gas and oil products division in the quarter as compared to the last quarter of 2022.As of the end of the last quarter of 2022, 40 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL).

We did so by trimming our position in Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), a stock we added to the portfolio in Q1 2022. As an integrated energy company, approximately one third of Shell’s revenues come from transition fuels, such as LNG, and another third comes from new energy sources such as green hydrogen. LNG is one of the cleanest fossil fuels and represents a potential bridge to the future by replacing higher carbon energy sources with lower carbon ones while renewable technologies mature. As the largest LNG supplier in the world, we believe Shell is particularly well-positioned to help Europe meet its energy needs as it looks for ways to replace imported Russian oil and gas with new sources after the embargo.”13.

We reinvested the proceeds in Philip Morris so that relative position sizing is more consistent with our increased conviction.”11.

If you want to see more places in this selection, go to the 5 Best Places to Live in Pennsylvania for 55 and Older.According to the Missouri Economic Research and Information Center (MERIC), Pennsylvania is the 23rd most economical state in the US in terms of cost of living as of 2022. The overall cost of living in the state is 1.8% less than the national average. One of the main contributors to this is the lower housing cost in Pennsylvania, which is 11.9% less than the national average.

Pennsylvania has a significant population of older adults, with about 15.4% of its residents being 65 years old or older.

As Wall Street debates the cause of First Republic’s (FRC) troubles, one analyst blames the nation’s top financial regulators. Fed Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen were “advocates of the strategy called ‘go big at the Fed’,” Chris Whalen, Whalen Global Advisors Chairman tells Yahoo Finance.“After 2018…we had a big problem in the money markets, so I think Chairman Powell…panicked in Washington, and they decided to provide more reserves.”As the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the central bank acted again, bringing the Fed’s balance sheet to nearly $9 trillion. “What they did, in essence, was throw a lot of money at a perceived problem, but they’ve created a real problem now, which is that interest rates have risen,” Whalen says.""The Fed has created a huge market risk, so these outliers like Silicon Valley, First Republic, have tipped over in a difficult funding market.”In his full interview, Whalen spoke with Brad Smith and Julie Hyman about the issues First Republic (FRC) is facing.Key Video Moments00:00:05: Powell and Yellen's strategy00:01:10: Huge market risk00:01:35: Unrealized losses on balance sheetsVideo Transcript- Why is it Jay and Secretary Yellen's fault?CHRIS WHALEN: Well, particularly, Chairman Powell, but also, I think, Secretary Yellen, were advocates of a strategy that's called go big at the Fed. After 2018, you recall at the end of the year, we had a big problem in the money markets. And so I think Chairman Powell and some of his colleagues panicked in Washington, and they decided to provide more reserves. They did so in 2019. And then we had COVID, and they even went bigger.And they expanded the Fed's balance sheet to almost $9 trillion. So what they did, in essence, was throw a lot of money at a perceived problem, but they've created a real problem now, which is that interest rates have risen. All the paper that was originated in 2020 and '21 is now trading 15, 20 points below the price where it was issued. And the banks are facing huge losses. Also other investors-- bond investors, REITs, all sorts of people that own these high-quality triple-A rated securities-- we're talking about treasuries, Ginnies, Fannies, Freddies, right-- which are supposed to be low-risk, but the Fed has created huge market risk. And so these outliers, like Silicon Valley, First Republic, have tipped over in a difficult funding market. And even JP, even Bank of America, you can see how their cost of funds is rising. It's very rapidly year over year.Story continues- Their cost of funds is rising, Chris. Hey, it's Julie. It's good to see you.CHRIS WHALEN: Hey.- Their cost of funds is rising. However, the whole issue of unrealized losses sitting on their balance sheets, like that in and of itself, isn't that much less of an issue, if it isn't-- isn't it even almost a moot point at the biggest banks-- at everybody besides the banks that seem the most distressed? I mean, those banks don't have to do anything with that stuff, right?CHRIS WHALEN: No. You see, that's the issue. In a way, yes, it's an optics problem. So back at the end of the third quarter last year, it was horrible. It was almost a trillion dollars in market-to-market losses on available for sale, and also held to maturity securities. But the problem, Julie, is that we originated $25 trillion for the securities in '21 and '21, of all descriptions. That paper has very low cash flow. So if I'm holding Ginnie Mae II's and my cost of funds is now 5, I'm losing money. OK? And so the embedded cash flow loss is the problem.And that's why you've seen some banks actually taking assets to the curb, taking the loss on a 2% or 3% asset, right? So they can go by a 6% or a 7%. And the whole industry is going to have to do this, Julie. They have no choice.]"

(GS) Worth Betting on Now?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/most-watched-stock-goldman-sachs-130001646.html,1682600401,STORY,"['GS', 'GSBD']","[Goldman Sachs (GS) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this investment bank have returned +4.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2.2% change. The Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, to which Goldman belongs, has gained 2.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Goldman is expected to post earnings of $7.91 per share, indicating a change of +2.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.1% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $31.82 points to a change of +5.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -2.7%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $36.16 indicates a change of +13.6% from what Goldman is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -6%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Goldman.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for GS _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Goldman, the consensus sales estimate of $12.34 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +4%. The $48.62 billion and $51.2 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.7% and +5.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryGoldman reported revenues of $12.22 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -5.5%. EPS of $8.79 for the same period compares with $10.76 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.03 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -6.16%. The EPS surprise was +7.99%.Over the last four quarters, Goldman surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Goldman is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Goldman. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

GPN is set to report its first-quarter 2023 results on May 1, before the opening bell.What Do the Estimates Say?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings per share of $2.29 suggests a 10.6% increase from the prior-year figure of $2.07. The consensus mark witnessed no movement in the past week. Our estimate suggests a 12% year-over-year increase in the bottom line. Global Payments beat the consensus estimate for earnings in one of the prior four quarters, met once and missed on the other two occasions, with the average surprise being in the negative zone. This is depicted in the graph below:Global Payments Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseGlobal Payments Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseGlobal Payments Inc. price-eps-surprise | Global Payments Inc. QuoteBoth the consensus mark and our estimate for first-quarter revenues of $2 billion indicate a 2.6% increase from the year-ago reported figure.Before we get into what to expect for the to-be-reported quarter in detail, it’s worth taking a look at GPN’s previous-quarter performance first.Q4 Earnings RewindIn the last reported quarter, the leading payment technology company’s adjusted earnings of $2.42 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.2%, due to elevated selling, general and administrative expense levels, coupled with a considerable increase in interest and other expenses. Nevertheless, the downside was partly offset by strong performances put forward by GPN’s Merchant and Issuer businesses.Now let’s see how things have shaped up prior to the first-quarter earnings announcement.Q1 Factors to NoteIn the first quarter, profits from GPN’s Merchant Solutions — its biggest operating segment — are likely to have increased from global constant currency volume growth and resilient customer spending. Increased travel and entertainment-related spendings are expected to have benefited the company’s performance.Both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate for revenues from Merchant Solutions are pegged at $1,631.7 million, indicating a 10.8% increase from the year-ago period. The strong software businesses and continued execution of a technology-enabled strategy are likely to have aided the segment’s results.Story continuesThe consensus mark as well as our estimate for Issuer Solutions’ adjusted revenues is pegged at $569.6 million, signaling 6% year-over-year growth from the first quarter of 2022. The addition of the leading accounts payable automation as well as business-to-business payments solutions provider MineralTree is likely to have aided the segment’s performance. These are expected to have positioned GPN for year-over-year growth.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate for revenues from the Consumer Solutions segment indicate an 18.5% year-over-year decrease. Higher levels of unemployment assistance benefits are expected to have affected the segment. The consensus estimate predicts lower profit from the segment in the first quarter.Profits from the business are likely to have been partially offset by increased operating costs in the first quarter, making an earnings beat uncertain. Higher selling, general and administrative expenses are likely to have affected the bottom line. We expect total operating expenses to have jumped around 1% year over year. Continuous investments to upgrade digital capabilities are anticipated to have weighed on margins.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Global Payments this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: The company’s Earnings ESP is -0.72%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate is currently pegged at $2.27 per share, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.29.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Global Payments currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Stocks to ConsiderWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for Global Payments, here are some companies from the broader Business Services space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around:Palantir Technologies Inc. PLTR has an Earnings ESP of +7.69% and is a Zacks #2 Ranked player.

FOUR has an Earnings ESP of +21.25% and a Zacks Rank of 2.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Shift4 Payments’ bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at 40 cents per share, which suggests a 166.7% year-over-year jump.

But the Street is actually looking past that in this latest earnings report, with shares moving to the upside. It's one of the top performers in the S&amp;P today. And here's what is giving investors confidence: growth in digital gaming. Sales from its ""Wizards of the Coast"" in the digital gaming division jumping 12%. That partially offset the 23% decline that Hasbro did report in consumer products. Another key part of this report was that the Street actually liked the guidance there. Despite a drop in sales, Hasbro very confident, maintaining its full-year revenue and operating margins. So they are expecting improvement in the second half of the year. Hopefully, consumers keep spending.- I know, right? I mean, I have to admit I saw some of the data on Hasbro and I was surprised that it was in digital. I didn't even know they were in digital, in the digital space. But clearly they got to ramp up there, because they're competing with Roblox. And that's where the eyeballs are. I mean, you guys know I have a small kid, 7, and he's already getting away from the toys, the tactile toys. He likes sports, but he prefers digital when it comes to things to play with outside of sports.- Hasbro not alone in a solid beat, because Mattel reported today and they're up almost 7%. They both had inventory issues. But there's more overlap. They're also working together. Hasbro and Mattel, a couple of days ago announcing collaboration, which you don't really see in any other industry. Imagine United and American, or whether it's Coke and Pepsi. So they're going to have collaborations like Barbie Monopoly, like Transformers Uno in a very interesting partnership. Some feel that there is a merger down the road, but just whispers at this point.]"

The top and the bottom line declined on a year-over-year basis.Ynon Kreiz, chairman and CEO of Mattel, stated, “While retail inventory management impacted the first quarter’s results, the underlying business performed well. Mattel achieved growth and gained market share, per Circana. The fundamentals of our business are strong. We expect to outpace the industry, gain market share, and achieve our full year guidance.”Earnings &amp; Revenues DiscussionIn the quarter under review, the company reported a loss per share of 24 cents, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 26 cents.

On a constant-currency (cc) basis, sales declined 21% from the prior-year quarter’s figure.In the North America segment, gross billings fell 27% (as reported and at cc) year over year. Gross billings in the International segment declined 16% (on a reported basis) and 14% (cc) year over year. The segment was affected by the dismal performance of Infant, Toddler and Preschool (including Fisher-Price), Dolls (including Barbie) and Action Figures, Building Sets, Games and Other, partially offset by growth in Vehicles (including Hot Wheels).Net sales in the North America segment declined 27% year over year on a reported basis and at cc.

Gross billings at Other declined 20% (on a reported basis) and 19% (at cc) year over year.Story continuesOperating ResultsDuring the first quarter, adjusted gross margin contracted 660 basis points year over year to 40%. The downside was mainly caused by inventory management efforts, including higher close-out sales and inventory obsolescence expense, cost inflation and unfavorable fixed cost absorption. However, this was partially negated by pricing and savings from the Optimizing for Growth program.During the quarter under discussion, adjusted other selling and administrative expenses increased $15 million year over year to $336 million. The upside was backed by market-related pay increases, partially offset by savings from the Optimizing for Growth program.Balance SheetAs of Mar 31, 2023, the company’s cash and cash equivalents were $461.7 million compared with $761.2 million as of Dec 31, 2022. Total inventories at the end of first quarter came in at $961 million compared with $969.2 million reported in the prior year quarter.The company’s long-term debt (as of Mar 31, 2023) was $2,326.7 million compared with $2,325.6 million as of Dec 31, 2022.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for your questions. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.I would now like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations ND Maduemezia. Please go ahead.ND Maduemezia Thank you, Leah. Good morning, and welcome to the SLB first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Today's call is being hosted from Rio, Brazil, following our Board meeting, held earlier this week.Joining us on the call are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer; and Stephane Biguet, ChiefFinancial Officer.Before we begin, I would like to remind all participants that some of the statements we will be making today are forward-looking.These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10K filing and our other SEC filings.Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our first quarter press release, which is on our website.With that, I will turn the call over to Olivier.Olivier Le Peuch Thank you, ND.Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on the call today. In my prepared remarks, I willcover three topics. I will begin with an update on our first quarter results; then, I will share our latest view on the macro and our positioning for long-term success; and finally, I will close with our outlook for the second quarter and full year.Stephane will then provide more details on our financial results, and we will open for your questions.It has been a great start of the year as we achieved results that set us on a solid footing for our full­year financial ambitions. On a year-on-year basis, our financial and operational results were strong across all geographies and Divisions.Following the remarks that are shared in our earnings release this morning, I would like to emphasize a few key highlights from the quarter. First, we delivered very solid year-on-year growth at a magnitude last seen more than a decade ago. Geographically, year -on-year growth rates in North America and internationally were comparable. More importantly, the rate of change is tilting more in favor of the international markets, where sequentially we experienced the smallest seasonal decline in recent times.Collectively, our Core divisions grew year-on-year by more than 30% and expanded operating margins by more than 300 basis points.Story continuesWe continue to position the core for long term success with significant contract wins and technology innovations that improve efficiency and lower carbon emissions. A great example is EcoShield, a geopolymer based cement-free well-integrity system and one of our latest Transition Technologies launched earlier this quarter. You will find many examples of these contract wins and the performance impact of our new technologies in today's press release.In Digital, we maintained strong growth momentum and also secured more contract wins. At a Division level, the amount of year-on-year revenue growth in Digital was somewhat masked by significantly lower APS revenue due to production interruptions in Ecuador and lower project revenue in the Palliser asset in Canada.Additionally, Digital continues to help us elevate our efficiency and margin performance in the Core, as we deploy these solutions at scale in our global operations.And in New Energy, we continue to make progress across our portfolio, notably with new Carbon Capture and Sequestration activities that raise our involvement to around 30 projects globally. CCS is recognized as one of the fastest-growing opportunities to reduce carbon emissions, and with the tailwinds from the US Inflation Reduction Act and other initiatives around the world, we expect more projects to move forward to final investment decisions in the next few years.Finally, we are delivering on our commitment to increase returns to shareholders. During the quarter, we relaunched our share buyback program, with repurchases totaling more than $200 million worth of shares.Photo by Viktor Kharlashkin on UnsplashI would like to really thank the entire SLB team for their hard work and for delivering yet another successful quarter.Moving to the macro, we maintain a constructive multiyear growth outlook. Through the first quarter, the resilience, breadth, and durability of the upcycle have only become more evident. I would like to take a few minutes to describe these factors.To begin, the underlying demand, investments, and activity during this cycle are resilient, despite short-term economic and demand uncertainties. The combination of energy security, the initiation of long-cycle projects, and OPEC’s policy, sets the conditions for a de-coupling of the activity outlook from short-term uncertainties.Indeed, energy security remains a top priority for most countries, and is driving structuralinvestments that are governed primarily by national interests.The extent of these investments is resulting into a broad-ranging growth outlook, comprised predominantly of resilient long-cycle projects in the Middle East, the international offshore basins, and in gas projects.Collectively, we expect these market segments to reach or exceed more than two-thirds of thetotal global upstream spend and support a long tail of resilient activity over the next few years. In parallel, the North America market, characterized by higher short-cycle exposure, is also set tobenefit from positive demand outlook and supportive commodity pricing. However, this will be impacted by an anticipated activity plateau in the short term, which will subsequently be reflected in production volumes.Moving to the dimensions of breadth and duration, these are also best emphasized by the latest activity outlook for the Middle East and Offshore market segments.Fundamentally, the pivot to both segments as anchors of supply growth is a defining attribute of this cycle. This is providing an unprecedented level of investment visibility and a scale that is setting many records.In the Middle East, the largest ever investment cycle has now commenced. This will support ongoing capacity expansion projects over the next four years, in both oil and gas. Consequently, this year we expect to post our highest revenue ever in the Middle East putting us on track toachieve our multi-year growth aspirations.Simultaneously, we are witnessing further activity expansion in the offshore markets. Offshore activity continues to surprise to the upside, with breadth and a diversity of opportunities across all major basins.In addition, the latest FID projections and industry reports indicate that the offshore sector is set for its highest growth in a decade, with more than $200 billion in new projects through the next two years.This growth will be supported by three layers of activity: First, the resumption of infill and tieback activity in mature basins, which was very visible across Africa in 2022. This will continue to strengthen in multiple geographies from this year onwards.Second, ongoing large development projects in both and oil and gas that are ramping-up and starting to scale. This is evident in Latin America such as in Guyana and Brazil, and in the Middle East such as in Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Qatar.And third, the resurgence of exploration and appraisal activity, which is starting to gather strong momentum in existing basins and new frontiers.From West &amp; South Africa to the East Mediterranean, we are starting to see exploration and appraisal at a pace that was unforeseen just a few months ago. Additionally, the activity pipeline continues to elongate with new licensing rounds and new blocks awarded. As a result, we believe that we will continue to witness durableoffshore investment for many years to come.Let me spend a couple of minutes highlighting what this means for SLB. As the cycle unfolds, the characteristics I have described continue to align with major strengths in our Core. This will support additional activity intensity for Well Construction; accelerated growth opportunities in Reservoir Performance through the return of Exploration &amp; Appraisal activity; and further long-term growth potential for Production Systems.One such example is the TPAO Sakarya project in the Southern Black Sea offshore Turkey.Thisproject involved all our Core Divisions supporting the development of a challenging subsea gasasset and the simultaneous construction of a gas production facility, demonstrating SLB's unique ability to integrate at scale, from Pore-to-Process.Looking more in-depth, our Production Systems Division is in a unique position as a long-cycle lever of growth for us with quarterly year-on-year results demonstrating our ability to fully harness its potential. We believe momentum is set to continue, benefiting from our strong market presence in the Middle East, and in the Offshore basins.In this Division, we anticipate cumulative bookings in the range of $10 billion to $12 billion in 2023, up significantly from 2022. We have taken a strong step forward towards this ambition with more than $3 billion in bookings in the first quarter, and the outlook supports continued strong bookings through at least 2025.Overall, this will provide durable revenue growth and a significant installed base for services in the years to come.In this context, our exposure to the Deepwater subsea market remains an essential component of our growth opportunity, and we continue to strengthen this part of our portfolio with much success.In Subsea, we have grown 20% over the last two years and are already generating EBITDA margins in the high teens, building on our technology, performance in execution, and the depth of our processing portfolio. We expect strong momentum for this part of our business to be sustained through 2025 and beyond.To conclude, we are in the midst of a unique cycle with qualities that enhance the long-term outlook for our industry-Resilience, Breadth, and Durability-all reinforced by a pivot to the Middle-East, Offshore, Gas, and a return of E&amp;A. We could not ask for a better backdrop to execute our returns-focused strategy.During the early phase of this cycle, led by North America, our results have already demonstrated our ability to capture growth ahead of activity and expand margins visibly beyond pre-pandemic levels.Looking forward, we are positioned to fully harness the International and Offshore momentum that is now underway, and to further our margins expansion journey.In the quarters ahead, we will continue to demonstrate our returns focus, capital discipline, and commitment to shareholder returns. I am truly excited about the outlook for SLB.Next, I would like to comment on our progress over the shorter term. For the full year, our strong first quarter gives us renewed confidence in our financial ambitions for 2023. We are primed for revenue growth and margin expansion through the year, underpinned by a very solid international outlook.In North America, we still expect tangible market growth but at a lower rate than originally anticipated at the start of the year, mainly as a result of ongoing weakness in gas prices. Taken together, we expect the strong international growth to offset any weakness in North America keeping our full year ambitions intact, with year-on-year growth in excess of 15%, which would support adjusted EBITDA growth in the mid-twenties.More specific to the second quarter.Directionally, we expect revenue to grow about mid-to-high single digits with operating margins expanding by 50 to 100 basis points driven by a seasonal rebound in the International markets. Growth will be led by the Middle East &amp; Asia Area, and continued momentum in the offshore markets.Building on this, we expect our second quarter adjusted EBITDA to reach new highs in this cycle, further extending the earnings growth journey we initiated 11quarters ago and taking another positive step towards achieving our full year ambitions.I will now turn the call over to Stephane.Stephane Biguet Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen.First quarter earnings per share excluding charges and credits was $0.63. This represents an increase of $0.29, or 85%, when compared to the first quarter of last year.In addition, during the first quarter we recorded a $0.02 gain relating to the sale of all of our remaining shares in Liberty, which brought our GAAP EPS to $0.65.Overall, our first quarter revenue of $7.7 billion increased 30% year-on-year as the growth cycle continues to unfold. This represents the highest quarterly year -on-year increase in more than a decade. International revenue was up 29% year-on-year, while North America increased 32%.Company-wide adjusted EBITDA margin for the first quarter was 23.1%. In absolute dollars, adjusted EBITDA increased 43% year-on-year.As a reminder, our ambition is for adjusted EBITDA to grow, in percentage terms, in the mid­20s for the full year of 2023. The first quarter was certainly a strong start towards achieving this goal.On a sequential basis, revenue decreased 2%, mostly driven by seasonally lower revenue in Asia and Russia as well as lower APS revenue in Ecuador.Russia represented approximately 5% of our consolidated Q1 revenue.Sequentially, our pretax segment operating margins declined 178 basis points largely due to seasonality and lower APS revenue. From a year-on-year perspective, margins expanded 298 basis points with significant margin growth in three of our four Divisions.Let me now go through the first quarter results for each Division. First quarter Digital &amp; Integration revenue of $894 million decreased 12% sequentially with margins declining 8 percentage points to 30%. These decreases were primarily due to lower APS project revenue and seasonally lower digital and exploration data licensing sales. The APS revenue decline was mostly a result of a pipeline disruption in Ecuador that temporarily reduced production and lower commodity prices impacting our project in Canada.As a result of these issues, APS revenue declined year-on-year, but this effect was more than offset by strong digital growth, including a more than 50% increase in our cloud and edge solutions.Margins for the Digital &amp; Integration division are expected to improve in Q2 as the pipeline issue in Ecuador has been resolved and as digital sales will increase sequentially in line with the usual seasonal trend.Reservoir Performance revenue of $1.5 billion decreased 3% sequentially while margins declined 207 basis points to 16.1%.These decreases were primarily due to seasonal activity reductions in Europe and Asia and lower revenue in Russia.Year-on-year, revenue grew 24% and margins increased 291 basis points driven by strong growth internationally, both on land and offshore. Well Construction revenue of $3.3 billion increased 1% sequentially, while margins of 20.6% decreased 44 basis points. However, year-on-year revenue grew 36% while margins expanded 444 basis points with very strong growth across all Areas on higher activity, increased pricing and a favorable technology mix.Finally, Production Systems revenue of $2.2 billion was essentially flat sequentially and marginsdeclined 148 basis points to 9.3% due to seasonality and the activity mix in Europe and Asia.Year-on-year, revenue increased 38%, while margins expanded 217 basis points driven by strong activity across all areas led by Europe, Latin America, and North America. Margins also improved compared to the first quarter of last year as supply chain and logistics constraints continued to ease.Now turning to our liquidity. Our net debt increased approximately $1 billion sequentially to $10.3 billion. During the quarter, we generated $330 million of cash flow from operations and negative free cash flow of $265 million reflecting the seasonal increase in working capital we typically experience in the first quarter. This largely reflects the payout of our annual employee incentives and the build­up of working capital that will support our anticipated growth throughout the year.Our second quarter free cash flow is expected to be materially higher and to continue to increaseinto the third and fourth quarters.Capital investments, inclusive of CapEx and investments in APS projects and exploration data were $595 million in the first quarter. For the full year, we are still expecting capital investments to be approximately $2.5 to $2.6 billion.During the quarter, we monetized our remaining investment in Liberty, which resulted in netproceeds of $137 million. We also spent $244 million, net of cash acquired, on acquisitions and investments in other businesses, the majority of which relates to the Gyrodata acquisition.Finally, we resumed our stock repurchase program and repurchased 4.4 million shares during thequarter for a total purchase price of $230 million. We will continue to repurchase shares in the coming quarters and, as previously announced, we are targeting to return a total of $2 billion dollars to our shareholders this year between dividends and stock buybacks.I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier.Olivier Le Peuch Thank you, Stephane.Ladies and gentlemen, I think we will open now the floor to your questions.See also 16 Largest Grocery Chains in the World and 15 States with the Largest Declines in Unemployment.Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions]We go to the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.James West Good morning. Olivier, you and Stephane, you outlined kind of an unprecedented, quite frankly, amount of contract awards, amount of visibility into the cycle. And curious, as you talk to your customers now, what you see as the durability of those awards, given the global volatility in economies and things of that nature. How are you thinking about the next several years? How are you guys perceiving kind of the steadiness of these contract awards and their ability to continue to go forward, even if we were to have a recession or something like that?And how that would influence your revenue and results?Olivier Le Peuch No, James, thank you. I think indeed, I think we have highlighted and I think in my prepared remarks, I shared the view that in the recent months and certainly in last quarter and I have been traveling in Asia, Middle East and South America. I have seen a customer, I think, taking commitments and being ready to commit to the supply capacity and to the partnership they need to deploy and develop the assets going forward as we believe this cycle is unique through, as we said, element of resilience by the nature of investment at growth rate, including the long-term capacity expansion committed in Middle East, including the large long-cycle elements that are growing in proportion led by offshore deepwater coming back.The breadth, I think everywhere we go, everybody needs - is seeing a customer reaching out to mobilize resource, sometimes for short-cycle production enhancements, most of the time for development commitment of assets and redevelopment expansion from infield to large-scale development.And durability is certainly improving and duration of the cycle, I think, is improving as we see because beyond the Middle East, '27 targets of capital expansion from -- for in the country. Other countries are targeting this towards the end of the decade.And here in the city in Brazil, Brazil has a clear ambition for 4 million barrel by 2030, and I've already committed up to 20 FPSO contract that will continue to build the pipeline of offshore activity subsea in particular going forward.So I'm very positive about the mix, if you like, of short cycle on production enhancements to address the anticipated supply super risk and the commitment -- long commitment from Middle East, from deepwater and offshore operator to complement the long cycle is not to offset and now take precedent over this short cycle and so turn, as we indicated, a turn into the cycle towards international offshore and Middle East in particular.So that's where we are very confident.James West Okay. That's perfect, Olivier. And then a follow-up for me. In terms of pricing, international and offshore versus maybe North America, kind of what you're seeing there in terms of the level of concern or maybe not concern but level of willingness to accept pricing increases. It seems to me like customers internationally and offshore more looking at or concerned about availability of service capacity rather than what it actually costs.Olivier Le Peuch Yes. I think the -- we are seeing pricing tailwinds and we have seen pricing tailwinds in the global market for quite a few quarters and starting in North America. It has turned to international based on two things: first, indeed, securing capacity going forward, giving us -- giving -- considering the tight supply of equipment, unique technology, giving a level of sense of urgency to secure contract and elongating the contract.You have seen example of nine years contract into the announcement we made today.And at the same time, I think performance matters. Performance matters to offshore operator. Performance matters for first gas, first oil. And there's a sense of urgency to accelerate the cycle. This is one of the priorities. And technology integration also makes a difference and is recognized and is driving a pricing premium. So the combination of supply capacity, the combination of, I would say, a sense of urgency for -- and quest for performance integration and technology deployment is driving pricing tailwinds that are serving us very well.James West Great. Thanks Oliver.Olivier Le Peuch Thank you.Operator Next, we go to David Anderson with Barclays. Please go ahead.David Anderson Hi, good morning, Olivier.Olivier Le Peuch Good morning, Dave.David Anderson So question on kind of the duration of the cycle in your core business.Well Construction is obviously a big part of that. I was hoping maybe you could talk about the pace of well construction that you see in front of you this year? And where you should see the greatest uptick in activity and kind of the greatest shift in technology as well? Noticed that North America was up 9% sequentially, which is a bit of a surprise. But where does that Middle East ramp--up fit in here? And kind of also a similar question to what James meant, question of capacity. If I'm one of your customers, what am I most worried about today? Is it Well Construction? Is that kind of the -- I would have to think that has to be on kind of towards the top of the list. But that -- and if you can sort of help us understand that a little bit. Thank you.Olivier Le Peuch Yes.No, I think you are correct. I think the supply of high-performance equipment in the Well Construction domain is under stretch today. And I think we are working very closely with our customers to prioritize equipment, price technology application and use integration, use digital to help deliver the performance they expect. So there is a stretch indeed in this.But going forward, I think we are committing the resource when we see the returns to be accretive to our margins and align with our expectation and ambition to continue to expand margins. So where we see the most activity, clearly, this year is an uptick and this will be the case as sequentially next quarter is in Middle East and offshore.A combination of an integrated contract we have in offshore with relatively complex assets on occasion that demands a lot of technology deployments.And the intensity of activity in Middle East, that is a mix of short-cycle and long-cycle development project, this combination is unique and I think will be putting more resource, more equipment, more technology and will drive revenue forward up.David Anderson And was the North America uptick, was that more offshore-driven than onshore this quarter?Olivier Le Peuch Yes, it was, indeed, absolutely. I think offshore is not only international, I think offshore is happening in North America. North America as northeast Canada, Alaska offshore and go from Mexico, the combination of which is set to grow and our pace this year, the -- I would say, the U.S. land and North America (NAM) activity. So we are also getting the benefit of our fit for basin success in North America that continues to hold and help us maintain, grow our share and come on a premium on pricing.David Anderson And then, Olivier, in the D&amp;I business, APS obviously impacted the performance this quarter.I was wondering maybe you could kind of pull back a little bit and help us understand how the Digital business is performing. I think the goal is at a $3 billion revenue target. Wondering if you can kind of tell us where we are now in terms of that run rate. And in order to hit those targets, I'm just curious, is that about your existing customers using Digital more? Is it adding more apps to DELFI? Is it adding more customers? Is it all of the above? Maybe help us understand a little bit more...Olivier Le Peuch All of the above.David Anderson Digital. I had a feeling you would say that.Olivier Le Peuch Indeed. But I think, indeed, Dave, I think first, in this quarter, obviously, the growth, and we have seen growth rate in Digital that is aligned with our expectations, aligned with our ambition to double revenue from 2021 to 2025.We have seen, as Stephane mentioned, during his prepared remarks that the new technology edge and cloud is growing at more than 50%, continuing on the trajectory that we have set in the last couple of years.And we don't see any sign of this slowing down. And indeed, expansion will come from multiple dimension. Obviously, getting more consumption from the existing customer we have. And we are today deploying one of the largest contractor in Petrobras, where we were and we are meeting with the team here, very satisfied deployment and growing number of users. That's an axis then growing number of applications, and that's where we want to deploy and go beyond geoscience, our petrotechnical suite, if you like, to digital operation, production and digital operation into the drilling domain, automating the full rig well construction process.And again, in Brazil, we are very pleased to meet with Equinor and look after the Peregrinoplatform, we're about to deploy for the first time in the world a full automated top side to bottom assembly, fully automated autonomous digital journey that we'll realize this year.So we have both the geoscience application deployment, the digital operation, and we have new customers coming in, and you have seen some new contracts that we announced this quarter.So we are growing to the pace we are expecting to be our trajectory to double. And in this quarter, this was unfortunately masked fully by the APS setback, but we expect this to resume and to be actually one of the leading growth sequential that you would see in the second quarter.David Anderson Fantastic. Thank you.Olivier Le Peuch Thank you.Operator Next, we go to the line of Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Please go ahead.Chase Mulvehill Good morning, Olivier.Olivier Le Peuch Good morning, Chase.Chase Mulvehill So a quick question. I guess coming back to international and just kind of focusing there. We get questions on this international ramp. And because the last six months, we've seen some oil price volatility. We've seen a couple of OPEC+ cuts.And so we kind of get a lot of investor questions if there's been any signs of OPEC slowing down, any kind of planned projects or CapEx plans. So let me just ask you if you've seen any indications of OPEC+ members slowing things down at all in the Middle East.Olivier Le Peuch No, we have not seen it. We have not seen any impact of businesses, and we don't believe there will be any we believe that these companies and the national companies are really set and fully focused on mobilizing resource to execute their very ambitious capacity expansion plan. I think you are aware all the commitments. And it's not only UAE and Saudi. This is across many countries in GCC. And I think this is to grow both oil capacity and also gas and commercial and gas across the region.So I think I have -- I've been recently in the Middle East and have not seen any sign of and challenging.And again, the multiplicity of contract awards that were tendered in the last 18 months and most of them multiyear, if not beyond five years, are really indicative of the commitment and the capacity expansion plan that have started. Inflection has happened and you will see this growing for the rest of the year. So we don't foresee any impact.Chase Mulvehill Okay, awesome. Appreciate the color there. The follow-up is really kind of on CCUS. You had a lot of announcements in your press release, which really highlighted your experience on the sequestration side. But there are other parts, obviously, of the value chain. And are there other parts that you would actually think that would be a good fit for SLB, like possibly the capture technology side?Olivier Le Peuch No, absolutely.I think we have indeed a unique right of play into the sequestration that have translated into a significant number of studies and services and modeling and digital that we have provided to a lot of customers. And these customers have approached us to participate, some of them emitters, that are non-oil and gas as you have seen some of the examples we gave in the press release earlier today.And then we are using our technology and innovation capability to explore and to invest into capture technology or to partner as we are partnering with Linde into the application of CCS project across the domain of blue hydrogen and ammonia for decarbonizing the natural gas, ammonia and halogen production.So we are indeed either associating or investing into capture technology, hence broadening our scope beyond sequestration and using our right of play to expand and create a business that will stand on its own in the years to come.Chase Mulvehill Okay.Awesome. Appreciate the color there. I'll turn it back over. Thanks Olivier.Olivier Le Peuch Thank you, Chase.Operator Next, we go to the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.Arun Jayaram Olivier, I wanted to get some insights on what you're seeing within the Subsea segment of Production System. I think you highlighted broadly within Production Systems, $10 billion to $12 billion of backlog growth potential this year or bookings potential. I was wondering if you could maybe characterize SLB's technology offering and integration capabilities relative to your peers as well as provide any update on the strategic transaction that you announced last summer.Olivier Le Peuch Yes. Let me take it at the level of Production System first and let me give a quick zoom.So the booking we are talking about is at the Production System level, which is the division encompassing our production system equipment capability from Subsea, as you pointed out, from actually in well completion, in well actually, subsea surface system processing capabilities.So when you put all of this together, you get an end-to-end from port to process, from send phase to processing that is quite unique in integration and delivery capability, hence, the opportunity we have to participate at scale and be a provider with our partner, Subsea 7, into the product of TPAO that you heard about where the first gas to flare was realized yesterday and celebrated by the -- in country.And this is quite unique so that's differentiated. We have end-to-end integration capability.We can design and deploy and develop a gas facility, and we have done this in the past and we can link it to with our partners to our subsea development and participate to the completion architecture. So this end-to-end is quite unique and give us opportunity to participate at a large scale into development.Now very specific to Subsea, I think we are also quite differentiated into the way that we can connect to the subsurface and we have this integration capability from the sub to the completion architecture. And one thing in particular I would like to highlight or two things. First is the electrical capability of transforming this Subsea 3, the subsea control and the subsea and well completion control into electric -- full electric capability.This is a game changer for the deepwater industry, game changer for low carbon and control -- digital control of subsea equipment and control of zone equipment and completion.This is very much again the case in Brazil. We are very fortunate to have established here a unique center of excellence, and we have, under the sponsorship of A&amp;P working with multiple operators that have joined us into a joint development program where we are deploying and we will soon deploy everything from subsidiary to septic valve to flow control valve, fully electric, that would change the game and creating a new step.So that's differentiated. With differential obviously are processing, boosting and processing capability. You remember the award that we got last year into Shell for gas processing subsea equipment into a large installation in -- and you have seen two awards this quarter in Brazil, highlighting our boosting capabilities.So we're unique into that position.And again, ability we have to integrate processing equipment subsea with the rest of equipment well or surface is unique. And that's something that is adding to our digital capability as well.So when it comes to the announced JV, I think we are seeing the process of going to the regulatory bodies in different parts of the world so I cannot comment any further than what we commented earlier. This is an exciting outlook, exciting opportunity. But until close, we'll move forward.Arun Jayaram Great. Olivier, my follow-up. You and the Board are in Rio this week. I was wondering if you could characterize on what you're seeing on the ground in terms of the upstream spending picture. And obviously, we've had a regime change recently with the new administration.Are you seeing any potential changes to the fiscal or regulatory regime that could impact spending over the next couple two, three years?Olivier Le Peuch If anything, this visit has been outstanding, outstanding for the Board, outstanding for engagement we have customers and clearly highlighting the potential of Brazil to be fulfilling a significant supply growth. In the future, as I said, A&amp;P and Brazil has ambition to reach or exceed 4 billion barrel from 3.3 billion today, I mean, on barrel per day. And they have already laid out the foundation of this of both production enhancement into the basin, the basin or the land basins and accelerating -- continue to accelerate the development of the sub-salt deepwater with up to 20 FPSO already into the play.So I think they also are pushing forward to the next frontier.They are about to explore Ecuador margin that give us another leg, if you like, of Brazil growth in the future beyond the already committed multi-year FPSO contract that are in place.So we don't see any change. If anything, we see an acceleration and extension of the duration of this Brazil outlook. And if I had to highlight one noticeable change that I've seen, a commitment to decarbonize, a commitment to digitalize that I think is the new -- the leadership is recommitted to. We have seen it and you will see it in the future. Digital operation will accelerate in Brazil by the main operator here. And the country will accelerate this commitment to CCS.We are very fortunate to be on the first and only bioenergy CCS project in Latin America with FS Bioenergia.And we met the team two days ago, and they are very pleased the progress we are making on the CCS product in Brazil. So you will see more activity and no slowdown, but any upside -- only upside to the offshore environment and then a low carbon and digital transition accelerating as well.Arun Jayaram Great. Thanks for the detailed comments.Olivier Le Peuch Thank you.Operator Next, we go to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.Neil Mehta Good morning, team. First question was around cash flow and working capital specifically was a bigger outflow than we had modeled in the quarter. Does that all reverse over the course of the year and you could talk about some of the moving pieces around that?Stephane Biguet Sure, Neil. So yes, it does reverse.As you know, Q1 is always the lowest quarter of the year for free cash flow. As mentioned, we have the typical working capital buildup. Particularly, we have the payout of annual employee incentives. This is a one-off. It was about $500 million in the first quarter. And then we build inventory for anticipated growth, particularly in the Production System division, as we've mentioned.So even though it was -- it remained negative, the free cash flow actually came slightly ahead of our own expectations. Our DSO was the lowest historically for a first quarter so we were quite happy with that. So yes, it will increase in the second quarter and it will accelerate in the second half on higher EBITDA, continuous capital discipline and working capital unwinding.Keeping in mind, we typically generate the majority of our annual cash flow in H2, but it will increase materially in Q2.So when you put it all together, the 2023 full year free cash flow will be significantly higher than last year. And clearly, on the trajectory to deliver the 10% free cash flow margin we committed for the 2021 to 2025 period. And just to close, this will allow us to, as Olivier mentioned and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, to return $2 billion to shareholders in the form of dividend and buybacks together.Neil Mehta That's really helpful. The follow-up is just the margins at Digital. I think it's hard to isolate because of some of the volatility around APS. Can you give us a sense of how you're seeing the underlying margin trends at the core Digital business? And in Q2, that segment margin progression, I would imagine, strengthens as you work through some of these Ecuador challenges.Olivier Le Peuch Yes.So as a reminder for everyone, I think our Digital &amp; Integration division, I think, comprise and combines digital and exploration data with our Asset Performance Solutions. So at the onset of our digital journey, we have set clear ambition for Digital margin to be highly accretive to SLB, at the same time, to accelerate growth to double our revenue from '21 to '25. We are on that journey and clearly delivering a very accretive margin to SLB.So now we have demonstrated in the last few quarters last year that we -- when we leverage best performance in APS and our differentiated digital offering, we deliver DLM margin visibly in excess of 30%. Now notwithstanding similar setback as we had material setback in APS ambition for D&amp;I as a combination is to continue to deliver highly accretive margins, certainly in the 30s.So going forward, we expect the margins of D&amp;I to sequentially improve based on the very solid revenue growth from Digital and very accretive margin for digital, combined with a return of growth for APS and returning a decent margin for APS.So as a whole, we're expecting to not only revenue increase but margin expand in sequentially and to continue to be accretive -- highly accretive for the rest of the year.Neil Mehta All right. Great. Thanks team.Olivier Le Peuch Thank you.Stephane Biguet Thank you.Operator Next, we go to the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead.Scott Gruber Yes, good morning.Olivier Le Peuch Good morning, Scott.Scott Gruber Good morning. Olivier, you mentioned the resurgence in exploration, which is great to hear for SLB. One concern out there though is the potentially limited number of experienced geologists across the customer base to prosecute the exploration programs just because G&amp;G departments were definitely scaled down during the pandemic.Is this a legitimate constraint on the strength of the exploration cycle? Or is this capability being rebuilt across the industry? What are you seeing on that front?Olivier Le Peuch No, I will not be overly concerned by this. I think there are two factors that are playing into this. The first at Digital, I think, is having a significant productivity gain for processing, analyzing and generating prospects, as we call it, from -- from modeling, from structural modeling to prospect identification, the seismic data set as well as the capability to process using digital capability has significantly improved. So the ability to create spotlight on the gas line or the oil pools, I think, is better than it's ever been and certainly much better than last cycle.And secondly, I think there is a significant service consulting capability that we participate into that can help complement and provide support to our customers.But I would say, digital, productivity, technology that has improved and give higher accuracy, better geology interpretation capability, better structural modeling from seismic to wireline, and to modeling or to sampling like our ORA [reservoir] samplingtechnology, all combine to give a significant support to the G&amp;G team of our customers and to not a slowdown but actually accelerate and improve the productivity and ability to generate prospects.So I'm not concerned. And I believe that you will see this prospect be fast-tracked from exploration to appraisal to development going forward.Scott Gruber That's great. And just how would you compare the strength of this exploration cycle? So those are the path. Is the trajectory trending us back towards that 2011 to 2014 period?Could we possibly get back to the mid-to late 2000s levels just as tieback opportunities are consumed? Just some color on the potential strength of this exploration cycle relative to history would be great.Olivier Le Peuch So I think I will contrast it more by saying the type of activity in exploration that is happening. And I think there are a lot of near-field exploration as it is called or backyard exploration that is being used by the most operators that have gained access to critical asset, critical basin or advantaged assets and they want to explore and do near-field exploration across and beyond and use tieback. So there is a lot of exploration happening across every basin, major basin that characterize this and has been -- this trend has been going up.And this trend is certainly different from the greenfield, frontier exploration that characterized maybe the last cycle.However, this cycle, I think, beyond the near-field exploration, we are seeing a return of frontier exploration, driven by energy security, driven by the desire to replace reserves and to secure new gas particularly, and we see it happening across many basins. I mentioned before the equatorial margin as one. You heard about, obviously, continuous exploration, which is almost becoming a near-field exploration across Guyana.But if you go across the Atlantic, you will find a lot of exploration happening in the south part of Africa, gave some huge success for two or three operator into Namibia that are here on the onset of something that could be very significant for the industry in oil development.And then gas in East Med, I think, has been developing, and you heard about the development that we helped fast-track on the Black Sea. That was also gas.So security is incentivizing people to invest and operator to invest into certain regions with access to the demand market and near-field is continuing to grow very well. So in combination, it's different from the past and I will not try to compare the scale but I think the quality of this exploration and the diversity in terms of customers and interval basin is quite unique and is really accelerating this year.Scott Gruber I appreciate the color. Thank you.Olivier Le Peuch Thank you.Operator Next, we go to the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.Roger Read Yes, thank you.And I imagine good afternoon in Rio. Maybe just to come back to the exploration appraisal kind of question. You mentioned that earlier, slowdown in North America offset or more than offset by what's going on in E&amp;A. So I was just curious what -- and I think you also mentioned it had materially improved in the last couple of months. What you think really has led to this increase in E&amp;A because it's not as if commodity prices weren't good in '22, right? And they haven't been something exceptional thus far in '23. So is it a change in just how your customers are looking at their future inventories? Or is there something else that's helping to drive this improvement?Olivier Le Peuch I think the energy security, the supporting commodity price outlook and the desire indeed to go and leverage the cycle to explore and to tie back reserve to the existing advantage basin or to fast-track gas or new oil pools as I described earlier.Now the timing of it, the acceleration, I think, is linked more to the availability of -- and the contracting of deepwater rigs or the contracting of rigs offshore or land on some occasion when it is -- when this exploration is happening.More than yes, but the cycle has started last year of E&amp;A return is accelerating in line to some extent, with the offshore acceleration. And I think it will be part of the mix and will give an opportunity to extend and create a new leg of activity and a new leg of FID in two or three years from now when those exploration will have been appraised and will be FID at that time.So I think it's more -- it's an underlying trend that have started in the last few quarters and have accelerated. And I think that is a more long view that customers are taking and not looking at the short-term uncertainty or short-term commodity price variation and committing on one new basin or committing on expanding near-field exploration.So that's the way we have seen it.Roger Read Okay. So maybe just the natural evolution within a cycle, I mean, as things get some duration, you would expect the exploration to pick up. One other question for you, just APS, so obviously, kind of highlighted had some issues. Looking back over the last couple of years, there's been talk of potentially disposing of these assets or at least not investing in them aggressively. I was just curious, it seems like M&amp;A has picked up or at least talk of it within the E&amp;P sector. So more likely, less likely, same to look for a way to exit these assets as you go forward?Stephane Biguet So look, Roger, on EPS, we really have to distinguish Ecuador. These are service contracts, tariff-based. There's no intention to exit.And we do need to maintain a minimum level of investment. But rest assured, these projects are highly positive in terms of not only earnings but cash flow.The Canada asset is a bit different. This is a pure equity position. And it's also very accretive in terms of cash flow even at current commodity prices. And as you know, we ran a process on that particular asset last year. We were not satisfied with the offers we received. So at the moment, we are happy with keeping that asset and the cash flow it generates. But if one day, there is an offer at the right price, we'll certainly consider it.Roger Read Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you.Olivier Le Peuch So ladies and gentlemen, I think I want to give a close to this call. It's almost to the hour.So to conclude today's call, I would like to leave you with the following takeaways. First, the quality of the unfolding upcycle in oil and gas is improving, with unique attributes of resilience, breadth and duration. This is very much evidenced by the strengthening outlook in both Middle East and offshore markets and further reinforced by the tight supply balance as demand forecast approach new highs at year-end.Second, our strong start of the year gives us further confidence in our full year financial ambition. Directionally, the dynamics in international markets will likely offset the moderation of activity growth in North America. In fact, we are witnessing a gradual shift from short-to long-cycle investment and a further transition to international, with both effects closely aligned with our strengths and paving the way for an exciting outlook for years to come.Third, our overall performance demonstrates the strength of our portfolio, focused on the most attractive and resilient market segments globally, both in oil and gas and low-carbon solutions.Our divisions continue to align with customers at most priorities on value delivered to performance and integration, with digital transformation and decarbonization as industry mandates.Additionally, pricing continues to trend positively, enabling us to extract more value for our products and services. As a result, we reaffirm our ambition to further expand margins as the cycle unfolds, to grow earnings to new levels in this cycle and to significantly increase returns to shareholders as further demonstrated this quarter. I remain very confident in the alignment of our strategy to formal trends in the energy market and fully trust the SLB team to continue outperforming in this context.Now before I close, I wanted to announce that ND Maduemezia will be moving to a new career opportunity in SLB after remarkable stands in his position as Investor Relations VP for the past three years.Thank you, ND, for the support and positive engagement with our investors and market analysts. Replacing ND is James McDonald, who is transitioning from his previous role as Americas Land Basin President. Welcome, James.With this, I want to close today's call and wish you all the best. Thank you. Good day, everyone.Operator Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.]"

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 4. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.89 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +41.3%.Revenues are expected to be $4.53 billion, up 8.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4.37% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Aptiv PLC?For Aptiv PLC, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +4.11%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Aptiv PLC will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Aptiv PLC would post earnings of $1.19 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.27, delivering a surprise of +6.72%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Aptiv PLC appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerParsons (PSN), another stock in the Zacks Technology Services industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.43 for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +7.5%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $1.05 billion, up 11.1% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Parsons has been revised 7.6% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 6.23%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Parsons will beat the consensus EPS estimate.

The company's market valuation decreased by US$1.7b after the stock price dropped 4.4% over the past week, but insiders were spared from painful losses.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.

So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$50.81. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.

In 2016, he offered mobile data for free, making his Jio telecom service India's top player. He is adopting a similar strategy to promote his consumer goods to rival Coca-Cola and Nestle.Viacom18, the broadcast division of Ambani's Reliance Industries, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Its shareholders also include Paramount Global as well as Bodhi Tree, a joint venture between James Murdoch and former top Disney executive, Uday Shankar.The Warner deal, industry executives and media analysts said, will boost Viacom18's already announced plans to ""innovate and disrupt"" the sector, and help to attract the premium English speaking audience in India.At stake is a slice of a video streaming market that is expected to grow annually by 22%-25% to reach $13-$15 billion by 2030, according to a 2021 report by Indian lobby group CII and the Boston Consulting Group.That compares with projected annual growth of 8.63% in the U.S. market, which is expected to hit $54.66 billion by 2027, according to Statista.While Netflix and other rivals boast of content specially created for the India audience, JioCinema's current free offerings largely include old Hindi and local language movies. In sports, it has IPL cricket streaming rights until 2027 and in March bagged exclusive rights for MotoGP in India.Story continuesThe big challenge is lack of fresh local and global content on JioCinema, something that will be become even more critical as the IPL season ends next month.JioCinema is in talks with various production studios and has plans to introduce dozens of TV shows and movies on the platform in the coming months, in Hindi and other languages, a second industry source told Reuters on Friday.""There are many Indias within India. While IPL is for the masses, partnership with Warner is a precursor to JioCinema's entry into the premium subscription segment,"" said Mihir Shah, vice president at Media Partners Asia.Nitesh Kripalani, former country head of Amazon's Prime Video in India, said he expects Reliance's venture to do more such deals, but pricing remains key.""India is a value conscious market. For any media business, anywhere in the world - you need to get consumers to pay. Advertising can only pay so much,"" he said.Netflix, Amazon and Disney Hotstar have become popular in India by launching exclusive movies and web series starring Bollywood actors. They have also diversified into regional local language content.At present Netflix - which has most the expensive subscription plans - has just 8 million subscribers, Amazon has 17 million, while Disney, which earlier had the digital rights for IPL, leads with 49 million, according to Media Partners, which doesn't have data for JioCinema's free service.Karan Taurani, a vice president of India's Elara Capital, sad JioCinema's success will hinge on quality of its content.""They may make so many films and series but (what if) more than 70-80% of them bomb? The only way to scale up is to really differentiate your content and make sure execution is right,"" he said.(This story has been corrected to add the dropped words 'in India,' in paragraph 1)(Editing by Sharon Singleton)]"

They now top global streaming charts and include major award-winning hits like Squid Game and Parasite.Backed by CJ ENM Co., the decades-long push to make Korean content global had its best year so far in 2022. Exports of TV content soared 90% and film exports rose more than 67% in the first half of last year, according to the Korea Creative Content Agency.Ahead of President Yoon’s meeting with American executives, Netflix announced a plan on Tuesday to invest $2.5 billion over the next four years in Korean content, which doubles the company’s investment from its first five years of working in Korea, from 2016 to 2021. Shares of Korean media stocks such as Showbox Corp. and Studio Santa Claus Entertainment Co. spiked more than 20% on the news.Story continuesThe Korean TV Boom That Has Global Streamers Piling Into SeoulWhile Netflix has been the biggest investor in South Korea among US players, Disney+ and Apple TV are also increasing investment and releasing more original Korean content. Paramount+ has a strategic partnership with CJ’s streaming service TVING and Studio Dragon.With growing collaboration between US companies and Korean creators, President Yoon pledged to ease regulation and support cultural cooperation.“I think the world is a single market,” Yoon said during the forum. Any regulatory hurdles that prevent closer cooperation will be removed, he added. “If you point it out, we will definitely remove it and get rid of it. We will do so so that Korea’s film and cultural markets can be incorporated into the global market.”--With assistance from Jeong-Ho Lee.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow a Dishwasher Engineer Challenged Elon Musk’s Grip on Commercial SpaceToo Big to Fail, But Not Too Big to Bail Out Other BanksTwitter’s Unpaid Bills Threaten to Be an Even Bigger Problem for Elon MuskAirbus Bets on a Stretched A220 Jet to Beat Boeing’s 737Is Daily Wire the Future of Right-Wing Entertainment?©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Smith, to analyze the inclusion metrics of the streaming service from 2018 to 2021 based on gender, race/ethnicity, LGBTQ+ and disability.The study released on Thursday showed increased opportunities for women in lead roles, directing and key creative jobs.However, Netflix still lacks significant representation of characters with disabilities, gender-balanced storytelling in series, roles for girls and women of color and opportunities for women writers.Despite 27% of the U.S. population identifying as disabled, only 1.1% of all characters in Netflix films and series have a disability, the study found.Latinos, who make up 12% of the U.S. population, acted in 4.5% of main cast roles on Netflix in 2021, up from 2.6% in 2018. That compares with 17.1% for Black actors and 9.4% for Asian actors.Only 1.9% of writers for Netflix films have been Latino, the study said.Asian casting has improved markedly, with 41.5% of Netflix series having an Asian lead or co-lead in 2021, after making up only 4% of leads and co-leads in both films and series in 2018.Shows featuring girls and women have increased significantly, from 46.4% in films and 50.6% in series in 2018 to 55% for both in 2021.

(stockcam via Getty Images)""Some users were expected to be lost in the process, but losing over 1 million users in a little over a month has major implications for Netflix and whether it decides to continue with its crackdown globally,"" said Dominic Sunnebo, global insight director at Kantar’s Worldpanel Division. ""Monitoring the next few quarters to see how many of these consumers decide to re-subscribe will be vital to Netflix's strategy in this space.""The company had said it plans to learn from each rollout, revealing it's ""pleased with the results"" so far — despite a ""cancel reaction"" in the majority of impacted markets.Story continues""While we could have launched [paid account sharing] broadly in Q1, we found opportunities to improve the experience for members,"" the company wrote in the shareholder letter. ""We learn more with each rollout and we’ve incorporated the latest learnings, which we think will lead to even better results.""Wall Street analysts have remained upbeat about the initiative, emphasizing its role as a longer-term growth driver, along with the platform's recently launched ad-supported tier.""We expect a lot of noise in 2Q23, and are being very conservative in our own modeling of churn in response to password crackdown,"" Jefferies wrote in a note to clients earlier this month.""However, we believe most of that churn will be somewhat impulsive, as it has minimal impact on the existing subscriber, and those members will return to the service over the course of 2023.""Jefferies recommends ""buying any dip associated with a conservative 2Q23 guide,"" adding Netflix is poised to be the number one distributor in video content amid those longer-term revenue drivers while discipline around content spend will ""jumpstart"" margin and free cash flow expansion efforts.Netflix shares are up 10% year-to-date and have soared more than 70% compared to the year-ago period.Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Bradway, chairman and chief executive officer. ""We look forward to closing the acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics and joining forces to reach more patients around the world with their innovative medicines.""Key results include:Total revenues decreased 2% to $6.1 billion in comparison to the first quarter of 2022, resulting from lower Other Revenue from our COVID-19 manufacturing collaboration, partially offset by a 2% increase in product sales. Product sales growth was driven by 14% volume growth, partially offset by 5% lower net selling price, 3% unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions, 2% lower inventory levels and 2% negative impact from foreign exchange. Excluding the 2% negative impact of foreign exchange on product sales, total revenues were largely unchanged from Q1 2022.GAAP earnings per share (EPS) increased 97% from $2.68 to $5.28, driven by other income due to a mark-to-market gain on our investment in BeiGene, Ltd. and lower weighted-average shares outstanding in Q1 2023.Non-GAAP EPS decreased 6% from $4.25 to $3.98, driven by decreased revenues and higher operating expenses, primarily related to research &amp; development, in Q1 2023.The Company generated $0.7 billion of free cash flow for the first quarter of 2023 versus $2.0 billion in the first quarter of 2022, driven by the timing of payments for sales incentives, rebates and discounts, lower operating income, and higher capital expenditures from the build-out of our new North Carolina and Ohio facilities.References in this release to ""non-GAAP"" measures, measures presented ""on a non-GAAP basis,"" ""free cash flow"" (computed by subtracting capital expenditures from operating cash flow) and ""total revenues and product sales adjusted for foreign exchange impact"" (computed by converting our current period local currency product sales using the prior period foreign exchange rates and comparing that to our current period product sales) refer to non-GAAP financial measures. Adjustments to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other items are presented on the attached reconciliations. Refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for further discussion.Story continuesProduct Sales PerformanceTotal product sales increased 2% for the first quarter of 2023 versus the first quarter of 2022. Unit volumes grew 14%, partially offset by 5% lower net selling price, 3% unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions, 2% lower inventory levels and 2% negative impact from foreign exchange.General MedicineRepatha® sales increased 18% year-over-year to a record $388 million for the first quarter. Volume growth of 33% for the quarter was partially offset by lower net selling price. In the U.S., sales grew 19%, driven by 32% volume growth, partially offset by lower net selling price and inventory levels. Outside the U.S., sales grew 16%, driven by 34% volume growth, partially offset by lower net selling price and unfavorable foreign exchange impact. Repatha remains the global proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) segment leader, with over 1.7 million patients treated since launch.Prolia® (denosumab) sales increased 9% year-over-year for the first quarter, driven by 8% volume growth.EVENITY® sales increased 49% year-over-year to a record $254 million for the first quarter, primarily driven by strong volume growth across our markets. U.S. volumes grew 43% year-over-year and volumes outside the U.S. grew 77%.Aimovig® (erenumab-aooe) sales decreased 32% year-over-year for the first quarter, driven by unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions and lower net selling price. For 2023, we expect continued year-over-year net selling price declines in order to maintain broad formulary access for patients in response to competitive dynamics.InflammationTEZSPIRE® (tezepelumab-ekko) generated $96 million of sales in the first quarter, driven by strong adoption in the U.S. by both allergists and pulmonologists. Quarter-over-quarter sales increased 22%, driven by volume growth. Healthcare providers appreciate TEZSPIRE's unique, differentiated profile and its broad potential to treat the 2.5 million patients worldwide with severe asthma who are uncontrolled, without any phenotypic or biomarker limitation. During the first quarter, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved TEZSPIRE for self-administration in a pre-filled, single-use pen, which improves accessibility and provides more flexibility in treatment options for patients in the U.S.TAVNEOS® (avacopan) generated $23 million of sales in the first quarter. Quarter-over-quarter sales increased 10%, driven by higher net selling price and inventory levels, partially offset by lower ex-U.S. volume driven by the timing of shipments to our ex-U.S. partner in the fourth quarter of 2022. U.S volume grew 27% quarter-over-quarter, driven by an increase in new patients starting treatment.Otezla® (apremilast) sales decreased 13% year-over-year for the first quarter, driven by lower inventory levels and net selling price, partially offset by 5% volume growth. Otezla followed the historical pattern of lower first quarter sales relative to the remainder of the year due to the impact of benefit plan changes, insurance reverifications and increased co-pay expenses as U.S. patients worked through deductibles. U.S. sales in the first quarter were also impacted by lower specialty pharmacy inventory levels compared to previous years, and price declines resulting from patient mix and additional rebates to improve the quality of coverage. In the U.S., Otezla new patient demand was impacted by free drug programs for newly launched topical and systemic competitors. We expect new patient demand to continue to be impacted by free drug programs from newly launched competition throughout 2023.We continue to see strong growth potential for Otezla given its established efficacy and safety profile, strong payor coverage with limited prior authorization requirements and ease of administration. Otezla remains the only approved oral systemic therapy with a broad indication and is well-positioned to help the 1.5 million U.S. patients with mild-to-moderate psoriasis that cannot be optimally addressed by a topical and can benefit from a systemic treatment like Otezla.Enbrel® (etanercept) sales decreased 33% year-over-year for the first quarter, driven by decline in net selling price, lower inventory levels in the distribution channel compared to previous years and a 9% unfavorable impact of changes to estimated sales deductions related to prior periods. Consistent with Otezla, sales in the first quarter were also impacted by typical patterns of benefit plan changes and higher co-pay expenses. Year-over-year volume was flat in the first quarter, with U.S. volume growing 1%, supported by improved payor coverage. For the remainder of 2023, we expect low single-digit volume growth, reduced year-over-year decline in net selling price and a gradual recovery in inventory levels.AMJEVITA®/AMGEVITA™ sales increased 52% year-over-year to a record $164 million for the first quarter, driven by higher inventory levels and 35% volume growth, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impact. AMJEVITA launched in the U.S. early in the first quarter, and a majority of U.S. sales in the quarter were related to inventory build.Hematology-OncologyBLINCYTO® sales increased 41% year-over-year to a record $194 million for the first quarter, driven by 49% volume growth supported by strong adoption across academic and community centers.Vectibix® sales increased 16% year-over-year for the first quarter, driven by 15% volume growth supported by positive data from the Phase 3 PARADIGM trial demonstrating the superiority of Vectibix over bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy.KYPROLIS® sales increased 25% year-over-year to a record $358 million for the first quarter, driven by 18% volume growth, higher net selling price and strong global execution.LUMAKRAS®/LUMYKRAS™ generated $74 million of sales for the first quarter. Year-over-year sales increased 19% for the first quarter, driven by 40% volume growth, partially offset by lower net selling price. Outside the U.S., LUMYKRAS has been approved in 50 countries around the world. We are actively launching in over 30 markets and pursuing reimbursement in the remaining countries.XGEVA® (denosumab) sales increased 7% year-over-year for the first quarter, driven by higher net selling price and 4% volume growth.Nplate® sales increased 36% year-over-year for the first quarter, driven by 41% volume growth. Nplate sales in the first quarter included $82 million related to an order from the U.S. government.MVASI® (bevacizumab-awwb) sales decreased 17% year-over-year for the first quarter, driven by lower net selling price, partially offset by 15% volume growth. The published first quarter Average Selling Price (ASP) for MVASI in the U.S. declined 27% year-over-year and increased 5% quarter-over-quarter. Going forward, we expect continued net selling price erosion driven by increased competition.KANJINTI® (trastuzumab-anns) sales decreased 51% year-over-year for the first quarter, driven by lower net selling price and volume. The published first quarter ASP for KANJINTI in the U.S. declined 36% year-over-year and increased 3% quarter-over-quarter. Going forward, we expect continued net selling price erosion and declining volume driven by increased competition.Established ProductsTotal sales of our established products, which include EPOGEN® (epoetin alfa), Aranesp® (darbepoetin alfa), Parsabiv® (etelcalcetide), and Neulasta® (pegfilgrastim), decreased 17% year-over-year for the first quarter, driven by lower net selling price, unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions, and lower volume. The published first quarter ASP for Neulasta in the U.S. declined 26% year-over-year and increased 3% quarter-over-quarter. In the aggregate, we expect the year-over-year net selling price and volume erosion for this portfolio of products to continue. Product Sales Detail by Product and Geographic Region$Millions, except percentagesQ1 '23Q1 '22YOY ΔUSROWTOTALTOTALTOTALRepatha®19719138832918 %Prolia®6233049278529 %EVENITY®1649025417049 %Aimovig®64569101(32 %)TEZSPIRE®96—967*TAVNEOS®23—23—NMOtezla®29498392451(13 %)Enbrel® 56415579862(33 %)AMJEVITA®/AMGEVITA™5111316410852 %BLINCYTO®1266819413841 %Vectibix®11112223320116 %KYPROLIS®23412435828725 %LUMAKRAS®/LUMYKRAS™4826746219 %XGEVA®3841525365027 %Nplate®24611636226636 %MVASI®12181202244(17 %)KANJINTI®33144796(51 %)EPOGEN®60—60120(50 %)Aranesp®115240355358(1 %)Parsabiv®583391866 %Neulasta®21138249348(28 %)Other products**1524119314335 %Total product sales$      3,975$      1,871$      5,846$      5,7312 %*Change in excess of 100%** Other products include Corlanor®, AVSOLA®, NEUPOGEN®, RIABNI®, IMLYGIC® and Sensipar®/Mimpara™, as well as sales by Bergamo and GENSENTA subsidiaries.NM = not meaningful Operating Expense, Operating Margin and Tax Rate AnalysisOn a GAAP basis:Total Operating Expenses increased 12%. Cost of Sales margin increased 2.2 percentage points, primarily driven by amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions, asset-related impairments, changes in product mix, and higher profit share.

In addition, management has presented its full year 2023 EPS and tax guidance in accordance with GAAP and on a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are computed by excluding certain items related to acquisitions, divestitures, restructuring and certain other items from the related GAAP financial measures.

GAAP financial measures are included in the news release. Management has presented Free Cash Flow (FCF), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, for the first quarter of 2023 and 2022. FCF is computed by subtracting capital expenditures from operating cash flow, each as determined in accordance with GAAP. Management has also presented Total Revenues and Product Sales Adjusted for Foreign Exchange Impact, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, for the first quarter of 2023. Total Revenues and Product Sales Adjusted for Foreign Exchange Impact is computed by converting our current period local currency product sales using the prior period foreign exchange rates and comparing that to our current period product sales.The Company believes that its presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information to and facilitates additional analysis by investors. The Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to enhance an investor's overall understanding of the financial performance and prospects for the future of the Company's ongoing business activities by facilitating comparisons of results of ongoing business operations among current, past and future periods. The Company believes that FCF provides a further measure of the Company's liquidity. The Company believes Total Revenues and Product Sales Adjusted for Foreign Exchange Impact provides supplementary information on the Company's product sales performance by excluding changes in foreign exchange rates between comparative periods.The Company uses the non-GAAP financial measures set forth in the news release in connection with its own budgeting and financial planning internally to evaluate the performance of the business, including to allocate resources and to evaluate results relative to incentive compensation targets.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations, or potential collaborations, with any other company (including BeiGene, Ltd., Kyowa-Kirin Co., Ltd., or any collaboration to manufacture therapeutic antibodies against COVID-19), the performance of Otezla® (apremilast) (including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion), the Five Prime Therapeutics, Inc. acquisition, the Teneobio, Inc. acquisition, the ChemoCentryx, Inc. acquisition, or the proposed acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics plc, as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business, outcomes, progress, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. We or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach of our information technology systems could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business and operations may be negatively affected by the failure, or perceived failure, of achieving our environmental, social and governance objectives. The effects of global climate change and related natural disasters could negatively affect our business and operations. Global economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.CONTACT: Amgen, Thousand OaksJessica Akopyan, 805-440-5721 (media)Arvind Sood, 805-447-1060 (investors)  Amgen Inc.

Due to these factors, the effective tax rate for the adjustments to our GAAP income before income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2023, was 14.0% compared to 18.0% for the corresponding period of the prior year.(g)The adjustments related to certain acquisition items, prior period and other items excluded from GAAP earnings. Amgen Inc.Reconciliations of Cash Flows (In millions)(Unaudited)Three months endedMarch 31,20232022Net cash provided by operating activities$     1,064$     2,164Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities1,358(111)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities21,509(3,514)Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents23,931(1,461)Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period7,6297,989Cash and cash equivalents at end of period$   31,560$     6,528Three months endedMarch 31,20232022Net cash provided by operating activities$     1,064$     2,164Capital expenditures(344)(190)Free cash flow$       720$     1,974 Amgen Inc.Reconciliation of Total Revenues and Product Sales Adjusted for Foreign Exchange (FX) Impact (Dollars in millions)(Unaudited)Three months endedMarch 31,20232022ChangeFX impact $(a)Three months ended March31, 2023excluding FXFX impact %(a)Change excluding FXProduct Sales$       5,846$       5,7312 %$         (103)$        5,949(2 %)4 %Total Revenues$       6,105$       6,238(2 %)$         (103)$        6,208(2 %)— %(a)Foreign exchange impact was calculated by converting our current period local currency Product sales using the prior period foreign exchange rates and comparing that to our current period Product sales. Amgen IncReconciliation of GAAP EPS Guidance to Non-GAAPEPS Guidance for the Year Ending December 31, 2023(Unaudited)GAAP diluted EPS guidance$  15.38—$ 16.59Known adjustments to arrive at non-GAAP*:Acquisition-related expenses (a)4.31—4.36Net charges related to restructuring and cost savings initiatives0.47—0.53Net (gains)/losses from equity investments(2.70)Other0.03Non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance$  17.60—$ 18.70* The known adjustments are presented net of their related tax impact, which amount to approximately $0.48 - $0.50 per share.(a) The adjustments relate primarily to noncash amortization of intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions. Our GAAP diluted EPS guidance does not include the effect of GAAP adjustments triggered by events that may occur subsequent to this press release such as acquisitions, including any impact of the proposed Horizon acquisition, divestitures, asset impairments, litigation, changes in fair value of our contingent consideration obligations and changes in fair value of our equity investments. Reconciliation of GAAP Tax Rate Guidance to Non-GAAPTax Rate Guidance for the Year Ending December 31, 2023(Unaudited)GAAP tax rate guidance17.0 %—18.5 %Tax rate of known adjustments discussed above0.5 %—1.0 %Non-GAAP tax rate guidance18.0 %—19.0 %  Amgen Logo.

NCLH is scheduled to report first-quarter 2023 results on May 1, before the opening bell. In the last reported quarter, the company reported a negative earnings surprise of 16.9%.The Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 43 cents per share, indicating an improvement of 76.4% from a loss of $1.82 reported in the year-ago quarter. For revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $1.76 billion. The projection suggests an improvement from $521.9 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Let's find out how things have shaped up in the quarter under review.Factors at PlayNorwegian Cruise’s first-quarter results are likely to reflect benefits of improving booking trends, fleet expansion efforts and robust passenger ticket revenues. Earlier, the company had said that the cumulative booked position for 2023 is higher than the 2019 reported levels.Also, the removal of COVID testing requirements from countries like Canada, Bermuda, Greece and South America have been aiding the company. For first-quarter 2023, our model predicts passenger ticket, and onboard and other revenues to increase 353.6% and 10.6% year over year to $1,553.3 million and $198.6 million, respectively.However, high costs are likely to have hurt the bottom line in the quarter to be reported. We expect total cruise operating expenses to increase 72.6% year over year to $1,269.3 million. In fourth-quarter 2022, NCLH’s performance was negatively impacted by the absence of premium-priced Baltic itineraries and the trend is likely to have continued in first-quarter 2023.Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.

The Company also unveiled the design vision of its first-ever beachfront resort, which is inspired by the tranquil seascape of Al Marjan Island, a group of four islands. The resort is being developed with local partners Marjan LLC, and RAK Hospitality Holding LLC.Rendering of Wynn Al Marjan Island - Exterior view from entranceSet in a pristine setting overlooking the azure waters of the Arabian Gulf, Wynn Al Marjan Island rises more than 1,000 feet (305 meters) above the sea, welcoming visitors to a premium luxury experience, including exceptional entertainment and gaming amenities. For its first project in the Middle East North Africa (MENA) region, the US-listed developer and luxury resort operator will create a serene and stylish setting that takes inspiration from the stunning sea views and brings the warm, relaxed ocean setting into its modern world-class hotel.With an estimated project cost of approximately USD 3.9 billion, the iconic silhouette of Wynn Al Marjan Island will transform and accelerate the Emirate's rise as a major global tourist destination, while also creating substantial value to its economy through tourism and job creation. The project will pave the way for the accelerated growth of allied business sectors. Foundation construction work began onsite earlier this year.The brand's signature, high-design opulence will be reflected in its approximately 1,500 lavishly styled rooms, suites and villas. Visitors can look forward to a wide array of entertainment options, a gaming area, 24 dining and lounge experiences, innovative spa and wellness experiences, a high-end shopping esplanade, a state-of-the-art events center, a theater hosting a unique production show, and other amenities. Designed for both longer visits and day trips from neighboring Emirates, the resort will offer abundant and layered experiences including nightly state-of-the-art laser and light shows.Story continuesThe design of Wynn Al Marjan Island takes its inspiration both from the natural landscape surrounding the resort and the leading design aesthetic of Wynn Resorts. The same geometric configuration of the curved shape of the beach on the island is echoed through the podium structure, similar to a great opera house, creating majestic views of the beach, sea and the horizon. Every diner in the abundant restaurant offerings lining the beach-facing promenade at Wynn Al Marjan Island will enjoy sweeping views of the sea.""We have spent the past year meticulously programming and concepting Wynn Al Marjan Island, carefully considering its unique location,"" said Craig Billings, CEO of Wynn Resorts, ""I am incredibly proud of our design and development team's ability to impart our legacy of rich, thoughtful design into a sun-soaked beachside resort that will delight customers, new and old.  We look forward to opening Wynn Al Marjan Island in early 2027.""The new resort on Al Marjan Island, a flagship development of Marjan, highlights Ras Al Khaimah's growing global reputation as a leading investment destination for high-quality hospitality projects. With a rapidly growing portfolio of luxury five-star hotels and residential developments that offer a wide range of amenities and services and boasting over 7.8 kilometers of sparkling beaches and twenty-three kilometers of waterfront, Al Marjan Island is today seamlessly transitioning into a world-class resort destination.Positioning itself as a sustainable and nature-based destination, Ras Al Khaimah is one of the fastest growing tourism markets in the MENA region. With its well- preserved history, rich archaeological heritage, and nature tourism offerings, the Emirate earned a place on the list of CNN Travel's best 50 destinations to visit in 2023 and featured on TIME magazine's World's Greatest Places in 2022.About Wynn ResortsWynn Resorts, Limited is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol WYNN and is part of the S&amp;P 500 Index.

The company is expected to report EPS of $1.27, down 3.79% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $2.01 billion, up 1.42% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $5.39 per share and revenue of $8.63 billion, which would represent changes of +10.45% and +6.83%, respectively, from the prior year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Zoetis.

With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon.

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 4. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis animal health company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.27 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -3.8%.Revenues are expected to be $2.01 billion, up 1.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.64% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Zoetis?For Zoetis, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.55%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Zoetis will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Zoetis would post earnings of $1.15 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.15, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Zoetis doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Medical - Drugs industry, Neurocrine Biosciences (NBIX), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.59 per share for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +321.4%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $413.53 million, up 33.1% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Neurocrine has been revised 4.9% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 21.22%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that Neurocrine will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.

180,6f8696e3-ee8b-38d4-add7-0b03394b79a6,ZTS,2023-04-28,3 Pet Stocks That Could Purr in 2023 and Beyond,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-pet-stocks-could-purr-183511010.html,1682361311,STORY,"['ZTS', 'TRUP', 'IDXX']","[Animal-loving investors may be interested in exploring opportunities in the pet industry. While there are altruistic reasons for supporting companies that focus on the well-being of our furry friends, pet stocks have also seen impressive growth over the past decade, which was accelerated by the pandemic. With everyone locked indoors, the pandemic really re-shaped how many people previously thought about pets. Therefore, this is a space that’s seen higher interest in post-pandemic years, despite a return to more normal levels over the past four or five quarters. With the pandemic being over, investors are looking past pet stocks and those of other sectors that received short-term headwinds. Fair enough.But the longer-term secular growth catalysts for this space remain intact. On that note, here are three top pet stocks I think are worth buying for 2023 and beyond.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsZoetis (ZTS)a magnifying glass enlarges the Zoetis logo on a websiteSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comZoetis (NYSE:ZTS) provides a variety of commodities and services for pets such as medications, immunizations, testing equipment and biodevices to eight core animal species. The company also offers various wellness products which include anti-infection treatments, dermatology solutions and medicated feed additives.According to Bloomberg reports on April 5, 2023, Zoetis has been given an average “buy” rating by eight analysts covering the stock. This is not unexpected, considering the organization’s status as an international innovator in pet wellness and its presence in more than 100 countries.Zoetis has a solid financial position with a current ratio of 2.37 and a quick ratio of 1.63, significantly higher than industry norms. This indicates that Zoetis has adequate resources to fulfill its current financial obligations.With an annual dividend payout of $1.50 per share, ZTS stock currently yields 0.8%. Additionally, Zoetis has announced that it would deliver a quarterly payout of $0.375 per share to investors on April 21st. Zoetis has maintained its dividend payouts due to its strong profitability, with net margins of around 26%.Story continuesThe growth in pet ownership in the U.S. is expected to benefit the stock as the pet industry saw an expenditure of over $126 billion in 2021, which can be attributed to the rise in pet ownership. According to data, in 1988 57% of American families owned at lease two animals. This number increased to 70% in 2020.Trupanion (TRUP)a veterinarian holding a small white dogSource: ShutterstockThe final quarter of 2022 saw Trupanion (NASDAQ:TRUP) report income of $246 million, up 27% from the same period the previous year and the 61st consecutive period where the business had a rise in revenue of over 20%.Trupanion experienced a surge in pets enrolled, with the total number of pets growing by 31% to exceed 1.5 million in the fourth quarter due to favorable industry trends. The company’s customers remained satisfied with the value proposition, as the average monthly retention rate stood at 98.7% during the quarter.Despite the net loss per share of $0.23 that Trupanion reported in the fourth quarter, it is not unexpected for a company operating in a still-growing industry. As Trupanion aims to capture more market share in this developing sector, the company  has been increasing its capital expenditures, reflected in its rising losses.Trupanion has an excellent opportunity for substantial growth as it has the financial capacity to continue taking the appropriate actions to expand. The organization has $153 million in net funds and temporary investments as of December 2022. To put that into context, at the average cost of acquiring a pet in 2022, which was $289, the company has enough resources to add approximately 530,000 pets to its existing pet base.IDEXX Laboratories (IDXX)vet looking at a dog's xray to represent pet stocks like IDXXSource: ShutterstockIDEXX Laboratories (NASDAQ:IDXX) is a high-quality provider of a range of products and services catering to veterinary clinics and other industries. Thus, it’s no surprise to many that IDXX stock continues to attract investor interest.IDEXX Laboratories seems poised for a promising future, anticipating profit growth of 46% over the next few years. This projected growth in profit is likely to result in increased cash flow, which in turn should lead to a higher valuation of the company’s shares.IDXX stock has outperformed its industry competitors, implying that the possibility of further gains due to mispricing is slim. Nevertheless, the positive outlook for the company is promising, and investors should look into other factors to capitalize on any future price decline.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Chris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.NRG doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act 2022 should support the industry’s transition toward clean energy sources to produce electricity. Utilities are also focused on strengthening the grid as well as transmission and distribution infrastructure.The huge infrastructure of the utilities faces the impact of the hurricane season each year. Infrastructure enhancement around the year increases the resilience of the entire system, reduces outages and allows operators to restore power quickly for customers affected by storms.NextEra Energy, with large renewable operations and well-chalked-out capital investments to strengthen infrastructure, offers an excellent opportunity to stay invested in the utility space. Other utilities worth adding to your portfolio include American Electric Power, Xcel Energy and Consolidated Edison.About the IndustryThe Utility – Electric Power industry involves the process of generation, transmission, distribution, storage and sale of electricity to customers. A substantial portion of utilities’ earnings is generated from regulated operations. Unless there is any major weather variation or unprecedented incidents, such as the coronavirus pandemic, demand for the services provided by utilities remains more or less steady, regardless of economic cycles.A clear transition is evident in this industry, with more companies declaring zero-emission goals on their own. Research and development over the years have resulted in a substantial decline in the cost of setting up utility-scale renewable power projects, aiding in the reduction of emissions. However, the ongoing increase in interest rates is a concern for capital-intensive utilities.Story continues3 Electric Power Industry Trends to Watch Out ForTransition Toward Cleaner Sources to Generate Power:  The operators in the U.S. electric power sector are gradually moving toward cleaner sources of energy to produce electricity. Per EIA, the annual share of U.S. electricity generation from renewable energy sources will rise from 22% in 2022 to 24% in 2023 as a result of the continuing addition of solar and wind-generating capacity.EIA expects total solar, wind generation and battery storage addition from the end of 2022 to the end of 2024 to be 77 gigawatts (GW). The expansion of renewable energy continues to eat into the share of coal in electricity generation. EIA expects coal contribution to electricity generation to fall from 20% in 2022 to 17% annually in the 2023-2024 period.The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will support and accelerate the utilities’ transition toward clean energy sources. IRA has removed the uncertainties relating to federal incentives provided for renewable sources usage. The act entails an opportunity for a wide range of low-cost clean energy solutions in a predictable way for a long time and will create earnings visibility.Courtesy of IRA, the utility operators are planning to add more renewable assets to their generation portfolio and shut down old polluting units. Per EIA, from 2022-end through 2024, 11 GW of coal-fired units will retire in the United States.Demand for Electricity Stable: Per EIA, electricity consumption in the United States can drop 1.1% in 2023 and nearly 1.6% in 2024. EIA believes that the expected drop in demand for electricity this year will be due to a milder summer forecast that would lead to less requirement for cooling. Despite the expected drop in consumption, the utilities will continue to add new renewable energy assets to the total generation portfolio.Ongoing Interest Rate Increase is a Concern: Utilities, to maintain, upgrade and expand operations, approach capital markets for loans. The utilities have been enjoying near-zero interest rates for the past few years. But multiple rate hikes in 2022 pushed up interest rates. In March 2023, the Federal Reserve again raised interest rates by 25 percentage points, taking the benchmark rate to a range of 4.75-5%.The increasing interest rates are a concern for capital-intensive utilities in the United States as these will push up capital servicing costs substantially from the current levels. U.S. utilities are currently spending a substantial amount on developing an advanced electricity network and strengthening infrastructure.Utilities might try to pass on the burden of increasing borrowing costs to customers but the necessary increase in rates might not get approved by the commission. In such a scenario, the utilities will need to digest the extra expenses, which can lower their profitability and make them less attractive to investors interested in the utility space.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates strong near-term prospects. The 56-stock Utility-Electric Power industry is housed within the broader Zacks Utilities sector and currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #88, which places it in the top 35% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

188,2d09c0d7-6612-338e-913b-c47b22b41d8d,NEE,2023-04-28,4 Stocks to Watch From the Promising Electric Power Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-watch-promising-electric-141702318.html,1682605022,STORY,"['NEE', 'XEL', 'ED', '^GSPC']","[The Zacks Utility – Electric Power industry stocks have been transitioning toward clean sources of fuel and focusing on lower carbon emissions. The introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act 2022 should support the industry’s transition toward clean energy sources to produce electricity. Utilities are also focused on strengthening the grid as well as transmission and distribution infrastructure. The huge infrastructure of the utilities faces the impact of the hurricane season each year. Infrastructure enhancement around the year increases the resilience of the entire system, reduces outages and allows operators to restore power quickly for customers affected by storms.NextEra Energy NEE, with large renewable operations and well-chalked-out capital investments to strengthen infrastructure, offers an excellent opportunity to stay invested in the utility space. Other utilities worth adding to your portfolio include American Electric Power AEP Xcel Energy XEL  and  Consolidated Edison ED.About the IndustryThe Utility – Electric Power industry involves the process of generation, transmission, distribution, storage and sale of electricity to customers. A substantial portion of utilities’ earnings is generated from regulated operations. Unless there is any major weather variation or unprecedented incidents, such as the coronavirus pandemic, demand for the services provided by utilities remains more or less steady, regardless of economic cycles. A clear transition is evident in this industry, with more companies declaring zero-emission goals on their own. Research and development over the years have resulted in a substantial decline in the cost of setting up utility-scale renewable power projects, aiding in the reduction of emissions. However, the ongoing increase in interest rates is a concern for capital-intensive utilities.3 Electric Power Industry Trends to Watch Out ForTransition Toward Cleaner Sources to Generate Power:  The operators in the U.S. electric power sector are gradually moving toward cleaner sources of energy to produce electricity. Per EIA, the annual share of U.S. electricity generation from renewable energy sources will rise from 22% in 2022 to 24% in 2023 as a result of the continuing addition of solar and wind-generating capacity. EIA expects total solar, wind generation and battery storage addition from the end of 2022 to the end of 2024 to be 77 gigawatts (GW). The expansion of renewable energy continues to eat into the share of coal in electricity generation. EIA expects coal contribution to electricity generation to fall from 20% in 2022 to 17% annually in the 2023-2024 period. The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will support and accelerate the utilities’ transition toward clean energy sources. IRA has removed the uncertainties relating to federal incentives provided for renewable sources usage. The act entails an opportunity for a wide range of low-cost clean energy solutions in a predictable way for a long time and will create earnings visibility. Courtesy of IRA, the utility operators are planning to add more renewable assets to their generation portfolio and shut down old polluting units. Per EIA, from 2022 end through 2024, 11 GW of coal-fired units will retire in the United States.Demand for Electricity Stable: Per EIA, electricity consumption in the United States can drop 1.1% in 2023 and nearly 1.6% in 2024. EIA believes that the expected drop in demand for electricity this year will be due to a milder summer forecast that would lead to less requirement for cooling. Despite the expected drop in consumption, the utilities will continue to add new renewable energy assets to the total generation portfolio.Story continuesOngoing Interest Rate Increase is a Concern: Utilities, to maintain, upgrade and expand operations, approach capital markets for loans. The utilities have been enjoying near-zero interest rates for the past few years. But multiple rate hikes in 2022 pushed up interest rates. In March 2023, the Federal Reserve again raised interest rates by 25 percentage points, taking the benchmark rate to a range of 4.75-5%. The increasing interest rates are a concern for capital-intensive utilities in the United States as these will push up capital servicing costs substantially from the current levels. U.S. utilities are currently spending a substantial amount on developing an advanced electricity network and strengthening infrastructure. Utilities might try to pass on the burden of increasing borrowing costs to customers but the necessary increase in rates might not get approved by the commission. In such a scenario, the utilities will need to digest the extra expenses, which can lower their profitability and make them less attractive to investors interested in the utility space.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates strong near-term prospects. The 56-stock Utility-Electric Power industry is housed within the broader Zacks Utilities sector and currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #88, which places it in the top 35% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are showing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential.Before we present a few Utility - Electric Power stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and current valuation.

These types of stocks typically pay out a higher percentage of their profits as dividends than other stocks, which means that they can provide a steady source of income for investors.There are a few key factors to consider when investing in high dividend stocks. An important factor to consider is the company's financial health. High dividend stocks can be risky if the company is not financially stable. It's important to look at the company's debt levels, earnings growth, and cash flow to determine whether they are in a strong financial position to continue paying dividends.In addition to that factor, it's also important to consider the overall market conditions. High dividend stocks can be a good investment during times of economic uncertainty, as they provide a steady source of income regardless of market conditions.One strategy for investing in high dividend stocks is to create a diversified portfolio that includes a mix of different types of companies. This can help to minimize risk and provide a more stable source of income over time.ETFs in FocusAgainst this backdrop, below we highlight a few high-dividend ETFs.Franklin International Core Dividend Tilt Index ETF – Up 5.9%; Yield: 4.05%; P/E:8.35XThe underlying Morningstar Developed Markets ex-North America Dividend Enhanced Select Index is a systematic, rules-based proprietary index and aims to deliver a higher dividend yield than the Morningstar Developed Markets ex-North America Target Market Exposure Index.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?Story continuesDouglas L. PetersonThank you, Mark. As we look at this quarter's highlights, I want to remind you that the financial metrics we'll be discussing today refer to the non-GAAP adjusted metrics for the current period and for our 2023 adjusted guidance and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted metrics in the year-ago period, unless explicitly called out as GAAP. We're pleased to report 3% revenue growth in the first quarter compared to pro forma results in the year-ago period. We continue to generate substantial synergies and manage our other expenses with discipline as demonstrated by the 1% growth in total adjusted expenses in the first quarter. Our focus on top line growth and expense management resulted in an expansion of more than 100 basis points in the adjusted margin and a 9% year-over-year growth in adjusted EPS. In addition to our strong financial results, we also made progress on many of the strategic initiatives we laid out for you at Investor Day. We continued to prioritize innovation in our technology budgets and reached important milestones in our cloud migration. We also hosted a record-breaking CERAWeek in the first quarter. And we also expanded our lead in AI with Kensho releasing two more commercially available products built on our proprietary AI and machine learning platforms. We'll discuss these important highlights in more detail in a moment. One of the key messages from our Investor Day last December was the introduction of the five pillars that drive our strategy of Powering Global Markets. Beginning this quarter, we'll be discussing our results using that same framework. We use these pillars as a lens to inform our decisions on capital allocation and organic investment that impact our people, our customers and the communities in which we live and work. First, I want to start with our customers. Delivering value to our customers drives every decision we make at S&amp;P Global. We constantly hear from our customers that they are focused on the same thing as we are. During the first quarter in almost every customer conversation I had, we discussed energy transition and sustainability as well as our products that serve private markets. We continue to see evidence of the value we create for our customers. We saw strong and stable retention rates in the first quarter with year-over-year improvements in Commodity Insights and several products in other divisions. As expected and previously discussed, retention rates in Mobility have declined modestly as automotive inventory levels and volumes start to normalize. We also saw some modest lengthening of the sales cycle in certain parts of the business in the first quarter as some enterprise customers, particularly in Financial Services, are understandably focused on margin protection and managing their own expenses. This is a continuation of what we saw in the back half of last year. As I've met with customers over the last few months, including large automotive OEMs, retail companies, asset managers, banks and others, the recurring theme is that they want to do more with us. There's a large opportunity to raise awareness of the breadth of our product offerings and customers have been consistently impressed by the products we've introduced to them. That should ultimately improve customer value and our results. We also look to create quality-of-life improvements in those customer relationships. And our CI teams have done an excellent job of helping customers migrate to enterprise contracts. That migration reduces contract complexity for our customers and enhances the overall customer experience in a meaningful way. Turning to our Ratings customers. During the first quarter, global billed issuance in aggregate decreased 7% year-over-year. While we saw strong sequential improvement from issuance levels last quarter, the uncertainty in the banking sector that emerged in March muted the impact to billed issuance for the whole quarter. Refinancing activity was strong in the first quarter, particularly high yield and bank loans, though opportunistic issuance remained muted. We're pleased that billed issuance for investment grade increased in the first quarter, though this was largely due to a few very large deals. We're also pleased with the strength we saw in CLOs in the first quarter. The decision we made last year to preserve capacity and maintain the strength of our analytical organization is already proving to be the right call as our growth in CLOs was particularly strong. Next, I'd like to focus on our strategic priority to grow and innovate. So far this year, we've launched several new products. In an example of our product synergies, teams from Platts and IHS Markit worked together to integrate the Platts Forward Curve into our real-time analytics platform, Energy Studio: Impact. We previewed this innovation at our Investor Day, which provides clients with the most comprehensive and valuable data and insights in the industry while strengthening our customer value proposition and competitive differentiation. So far this year, we've also introduced new Price Assessments for Black Mass in Europe and Asia and for R-PET in India to improve transparency in pricing of battery raw materials and recycled plastics. We remain focused and disciplined in our M&amp;A, completing the acquisitions of TruSight and ChartIQ within Market Intelligence and Market Scan within Mobility. These tuck-in acquisitions strengthen our current offerings, though we expect even this type of M&amp;A activity to be rare for the rest of the year. As discussed at Investor Day, we're introducing our Vitality revenue metric, which consists of revenue derived from new or substantially enhanced products. We're pleased that in the first quarter, Vitality revenue constituted 11% of total revenue, consistent with our goal of maintaining a Vitality Index at or above 10%. Much of this growth will be enabled by enhancements to our own data and technology capabilities. As we optimize our technology spend to accelerate the pace of innovation, we're thrilled with the progress made in the first quarter. As we disclosed in February, we announced a strategic partnership with Amazon AWS to collaborate in product development and joint go-to-market initiatives. That partnership allows us to further transition workloads to the cloud and decommission our own data centers, three of which we closed just in the first quarter. Cross-organization teams also worked diligently to complete two software systems integrations to ensure that the combined company is operating on unified platforms in the most efficient way possible. Initiatives like these allow us to put more resources behind revenue-generating innovation as well, like the AI-powered products that Kensho has been developing for 5 years. There is excitement in the field of artificial intelligence. And we're extending our leadership and focusing on innovation that will benefit our customers and increase the value of our products. With the commercial launch of two new products in the first quarter, there are five Kensho-branded, AI-powered products commercially available today on the S&amp;P Global Marketplace. We're very excited about the developments in this field, and we'll discuss our own launches in more detail in the coming months. Shifting now to how we lead and inspire our people, customers and communities. In the first quarter, we launched the ninth iteration of our People First initiative and made investments to expand resources for continuous learning, leadership development and upskilling through our EssentialTECH programs. These investments in our people help us attract, retain and develop incredibly talented people, which ultimately leads to better financial results for our shareholders, too. We also continue to lead and inspire the industries we serve as we power global markets. In the first quarter, we published the inaugural Look Forward report, which outlines the expectations of our economists, analysts, researchers and data experts. This report is a product of our Research Council at S&amp;P Global, which was formed last year to help us look beyond the near term and explore the trends that will shape our collective future. Lastly, as I mentioned earlier, we hosted CERAWeek in Houston, Texas in March. This conference brought together over 8,000 leaders in the energy industry, who participated in over 650 events to help tackle global issues like energy security, energy transition and sustainability as well as how to navigate the turbulent times in the commodity markets today. Now looking across the company, we're pleased with the strong execution of all our divisions this quarter. While we continue to see the impact of the issuance environment in our Ratings division, we're also seeing signs of revenue stabilization as we begin to lap the challenging issuance conditions that began during the first quarter last year. We saw positive revenue growth in all of our other divisions in the first quarter and continue to balance expense management with strategic organic investment to make sure we're well positioned to accelerate our revenue growth over the next few years. Expenses can, of course, be seasonal. So we look at the margins on a trailing 12-month basis. And we expect these figures to improve as we progress through the year. As we look through the remainder of the year, I'd like to touch on some of the factors influencing our company's performance. We continue to expect a mild recession this year, though the timing is more likely a few months later relative to our initial expectations. We also expect to see volatility in various markets, including equities, credit and commodities. We see no change to the secular trends shaping the future opportunities for us, like the shift from active to passive asset management and energy transition. While these market expectations are mostly unchanged from February, we wanted to highlight the potential impact in the banking market. As we're all aware, the events around regional banks in the U.S. and a major Swiss bank added uncertainty to the markets in March. We do not have material direct exposure to the impacted regional banks. And we do not expect the events in that end market to materially increase the risk to our financial guidance in 2023 or to the medium-term targets we laid out at Investor Day. We do see slightly elevated risk of default rates impacting the broader credit markets, particularly in high yield, which will also inform our updated issuance outlook. Our Ratings financial results and guidance are closely tied to billed issuance. And for 2023, we now expect build issuance to be up approximately 3% to 7% for the full year. Our latest Ratings research group forecast calls for a decline in global market issuance. As a reminder, market issuance can differ materially from billed issuance, as we've described in recent quarters, with much of the delta this year driven by declines in unrated debt and sovereign and international public finance, which don't impact billed issuance. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Ewout Steenbergen, who is going to provide additional insights into our financial performance and outlook. Ewout?Ewout Lucien SteenbergenThank you, Doug. As a reminder, the financial metrics that we will be discussing today refer to non-GAAP adjusted metrics for the current period and for our 2023 adjusted guidance and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted metrics in the year ago period, unless explicitly called out as GAAP. For the first quarter of 2023, adjusted earnings per share increased 9% year-over-year. This growth was driven by a combination of 3% revenue growth, 100 basis points of operating margin expansion and an 8% reduction in the fully diluted share count. This is an excellent example of strong execution and prudent capital management combining to create long-term shareholder value. And we're pleased with the start to 2023. Revenue growth in the quarter was driven by growth in Market Intelligence and strong performance in Commodity Insights and Mobility. This was offset by a lower issuance environment compared to the first quarter of last year, though issuance improved sequentially from the fourth quarter. We'll walk through the divisions in more detail in a moment. Adjusted expenses were up only 1% year-over-year, driven by cost synergies and other operational efficiencies. Adjusted operating profit increased 5% year-over-year as margins expanded to 46.2%. I'm pleased to report a sustainability and energy transition revenue increase of 27% to $69 million in the quarter, driven by strong demand in sustainability products in MI's climate and physical risk products and CI's energy transition products. Private market solutions revenue remained at the $100 million level as growth in products from Market Intelligence were offset by declines in Ratings due to the timing of private market issuance. We still expect growth in private markets this year to be in line with the targets laid out at Investor Day. Vitality revenue, which is the revenue generated by innovation through new or enhanced products from across the organization was $326 million in the first quarter, representing a 17% increase compared to prior year. Synergies are a key contributor to expense savings and margin expansion this quarter. In the first quarter of 2023, we recognized $131 million of expense savings due to cost synergies. And our annualized run rate exiting the quarter was $552 million. And we continue to expect our year-end run rate to be approximately $600 million. We continue to make progress on our revenue synergies as well with $17 million in synergies achieved in the first quarter and an annualized run rate of $52 million. Turning to strategic capital allocation. We remain committed to disciplined capital management, including investing for long-term growth and returning excess capital to shareholders. We executed a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program, or ASR, in the first quarter. And we plan to launch a new $1 billion ASR in the coming weeks, leveraging the proceeds of the Engineering Solutions divestiture and cash on hand. We have been able to take advantage of market dislocations over the last year to repurchase shares at attractive prices, which allowed us to reduce our fully diluted share count by 8% over that time period. Since the close of the merger last year, we have been able to repurchase more than 31% of the shares issued to complete the merger with IHS Markit. We continue to invest in organic growth as well and remain on track to invest $150 million in our 2023 strategic projects. Now let's turn to the division results. Market Intelligence revenue increased 5%, driven by strong growth in Data &amp; Advisory Solutions and Credit &amp; Risk Solutions and favorable commercial conditions overall. Desktop grew 3.5% in the first quarter, driven in part by strong demand for new content and capabilities supported by the merger, though growth was tempered somewhat by a continuation of the modest softness in Financial Services that we called out last quarter. Renewal rates remained strong in the mid- to high 90s. Data &amp; Advisory Solutions and Enterprise Solutions both benefited from solid growth in subscription-based offerings. Credit &amp; Risk Solutions benefited from strong new sales for RatingsXpress and RatingsDirect products. Adjusted expenses were roughly flat year-over-year as increases in compensation expense, cloud spend and T&amp;E were offset by cost synergies and lower occupancy costs. Operating profit increased 16% and operating margin increased 300 basis points to 32%. Looking at the remainder of 2023. We know the comparisons will get easier as we progress through the year. And we continue to expect improvements in those products within Enterprise Solutions that depend on capital market activity. We also expect revenue synergies to begin positively impacting results in the back half of the year. We continue to recognize significant cost synergies as well and remain confident in our ability to deliver accelerating growth and full year margin expansion in Market Intelligence. While we are not changing the formal guidance ranges for revenue or adjusted operating margin, we do see increased uncertainty in the markets and within the banking sector specifically. As such, we may come in closer to the low end of these ranges. Now turning to Ratings. Despite being down year-over-year, we're encouraged by the improvement we have seen in the issuance environment relative to last quarter. Revenue decreased 5% year-over-year. However, this is the second quarter in a row of sequential improvement in transaction revenue as investment grade and high-yield show pockets of strength in the quarter, particularly in January and February. Non-transaction revenue declined 4% and 2% on a constant currency basis primarily due to declines in initial issuer credit rating and rating evaluation service, partially offset by growth in CRISIL. Adjusted expenses decreased 3%, driven by lower occupancy costs and outside services expenses, partially offset by higher compensation expense. This resulted in a 6% decrease in operating profit and an 80 basis point decrease in operating margin to 58.3%. We raised our billed issuance assumption for 2023 and expect issuance to increase in the range of 3% to 7%, reflecting the stronger issuance trends in the first quarter. We expect to see an improvement in full year transaction revenues compared to our initial expectations, though we expect the upside to be offset by slightly lower contribution from non-transaction due to ICR and RES headwinds. And now turning to Commodity Insights. Revenue growth accelerated to 9% despite a very high comparison last year. Excluding the impact of the CERAWeek conference, revenue growth for Commodity Insights would have been approximately 6% year-over-year. Growth was partially offset by the loss of revenue related to Russia, which contributed $11 million in the first quarter of 2022. The Advisory and Transactional Services increased 28% in the quarter, primarily due to CERAWeek as we saw record attendance, coupled with strong sponsorship sales. Upstream Data &amp; Insights declined approximately 1% year-over-year. And subscription growth was offset by reduced one-time sales relative to last year. As we noted last quarter, we continue to expect low single-digit revenue growth in upstream for the full year. Price Assessments and Energy &amp; Resources Data &amp; insights both grew 8% compared to prior year, driven by strong performance in crude oil products and continued commercial momentum. Adjusted expenses increased 3%, primarily due to higher event costs, driven by conferences, T&amp;E and compensation, partially offset by realization of cost synergies and lower consulting spend. Excluding the impact of CERAWeek, expense growth would have been only 1%. Operating profit for CI increased a very strong 17% and operating margin improved 310 basis points to 46.1%. We expect Commodity Insights to continue to benefit from strong demand in Price Assessments and other subscription offerings as well as the continuation of secular trends around energy transition and sustainability. As we saw from the incredible growth at CERAWeek, there remains a remarkable opportunity to further our leadership in the energy sector and in commodities more broadly. And we will continue to invest to capture that opportunity and drive multiyear profitable growth. In our Mobility division, revenue increased 10% year-over-year, driven by continued new business growth in CARFAX, strong recall activity and growth within Planning Solutions products. The Market Scan acquisition contributed approximately 1 point of revenue growth in the quarter and is recognized in the dealer category. Dealer revenue increased 10% year-over-year, driven by price increases and new store growth, particularly in CARFAX for Life and used car subscription products. Manufacturing grew 11% year-over-year, driven by our planning products and recall activity. Financials and other also increased 11% as the business line continues to benefit from strong underwriting volumes and a favorable pricing environment. Adjusted expenses increased 8% due to year-over-year increases in headcount, investment in software and additional cloud usage, partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense. This resulted in a 14% increase in adjusted operating profit and 130 basis points operating margin expansion year-over-year. As we expected, we've seen expense growth rates moderate from fourth quarter. And we continue to expect margin expansion this year. We expect the Market Scan acquisition to contribute approximately 150 basis points of revenue growth in the full year, though we expect it to be modestly dilutive to adjusted margins in 2023. All of this is reflected in our updated guidance. Turning to S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. Revenue increased 1%, primarily due to strong growth in Exchange-Traded Derivatives volumes offset by declines in Asset-Linked Fees. Asset-Linked Fees were down 6%, primarily driven by lower AUM in ETFs, which decreased 4% from the year-ago period as price depreciation more than offset slightly positive year-over-year net inflows. Exchange-Traded Derivatives revenue increased 30% on increased trading volumes across key contracts, including an approximately 59% increase in S&amp;P 500 Index options volume. Data &amp; Custom Subscriptions was flat on the quarter. Though excluding the impact of some minor reclassification of revenue as outlined on the slide, growth would have been 5% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for end-of-day and real-time data feeds. During the quarter, expenses decreased 7% year-over-year, driven by realization of cost synergies, lower bad debt expense and timing of discretionary spend, which was partially offset by continued strategic investments. Operating profit in Indices increased 4% and operating margin improved 250 basis points to 71.8%. As reflected in today's results, Indices will continue to face headwinds in Asset-Linked Fees as the year-over-year depreciation in underlying asset prices impacts the division on a lagged basis. Exchange-Traded Derivatives revenue was well above our earlier expectations, though these volumes can be volatile and difficult to predict. We continue to invest to achieve the 2025 and 2026 target for 10%-plus growth in Indices. And we expect those investments as well as the timing of certain expenses to drive margins for the full year back within the guidance range. In Engineering Solutions, we saw 2% revenue growth and 4% adjusted expense growth. As noted in our materials, we now expect to close the divestiture of Engineering Solutions next week. We're updating our guidance to reflect the accelerated timeline relative to our initial expectation for a June 30 close. I've had the pleasure of overseeing the Engineering Solutions division since the merger closed. And I would like to thank them for the incredible dedication and professionalism that teams have consistently demonstrated. We're confident that they will be a strong addition to KKR, and wish them all the best. Now let's move to the latest views from our economists, who are forecasting global GDP growth of 2.7% in 2023. While GDP growth is expected to be positive, our guidance still assumes a mild recession in the middle of the year and a modest recovery as we exit 2023. We continue to expect inflation above the target rates of central banks and energy prices like crude oil to remain above the historical averages as well. This creates favorable commercial conditions for many of our businesses, though it also contributes to volatility in the issuance environment as we have been discussing over the last year. As we consider how all of this will ultimately impact our financial performance in 2023, let's turn to our guidance. Now that we have some certainty around the timing of the Engineering Solutions divestiture, we can introduce initial GAAP guidance. Adjusted guidance for the company reflects the first quarter results as well as the updated view on the macroeconomic environment, issuance trends, equity valuations and other key drivers as previously outlined. Our full year guidance now assumes that strong revenue performance in the first quarter is offset by a lower revenue contribution from Engineering Solutions due to the accelerated timing of the divestiture. The only change to our consolidated full year adjusted guidance is in adjusted free cash flow, which has been reduced by approximately $100 million, primarily driven up by updated assumptions around cash taxes related to the R&amp;D tax credit. We have provided granular guidance on corporate unallocated expense, deal-related amortization, interest income and tax rate in the supplemental deck posted to our IR site, though these are unchanged from prior guidance. The final slides in this deck illustrate our revenue and margin guidance by division, reflecting the drivers that I mentioned previously. In conclusion, despite the continued uncertainty in the macro environment, we have had a solid start to 2023 and remain confident about the outlook for the rest of the year. Before we open up for Q&amp;A, I want to reiterate how excited we are as a management team when we consider the incredible opportunities we have to drive growth and innovation and the secular trends that continue to benefit our business from key investment areas, like energy transition and private markets, to the inspiring breakthroughs that our Kensho team has driven in artificial intelligence and large language models. It's a privilege to discuss the many ways we plan to create long-term shareholder value in the coming years. It's also a privilege to share this stage with leaders like Saugata Saha, President of Commodity Insights; and Dan Draper, CEO of S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, both of whom we'd like to invite to join us for Q&amp;A. And with that, we'll turn the call back over to Mark for your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperatorOur first question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.Manav Shiv PatnaikDoug, upfront, you mentioned retention rates in Mobility were declining modestly. I was just hoping you could provide a little bit more color there perhaps with some numbers. But is that the trend you're seeing across your segments, just given the uncertain macros out there?Douglas L. PetersonThank you, Manav, for joining the call. The Mobility question you have relates to some of the changes that are happening at a structural level in the mobility and transportation business. If you recall, the last couple of years, we saw all of the used cars became a very large sales aspect for the dealers and the automotive manufacturers. The OEMs were struggling to actually meet demand. So we're seeing a shift away from used cars to new cars. And we actually expect that there's going to be a lot of growth in the sales of automotive products around the globe this year. And where we're seeing some of the slowdown in subscription relates to dealers as dealers don't have necessarily the same margin. They might be changing some of their approach to how they're working with the sales force they have. So we're seeing that, that's one of the areas where we see some disruption in some retention rates that have started to drop. Other than that across the board and the rest of the company, we do not see any changes whatsoever to retention rates.Manav Shiv PatnaikGot it. And Ewout, just on the Ratings guidance, apologies I missed it, I think you said more transactional revenue but offset by two items. I was just hoping you could elaborate what those offsets were.Ewout Lucien SteenbergenYes, sure, Manav. If you look at the dimensions with respect to market issuance and billed issuance, actually we're seeing exactly the opposite of the pattern of 2022. So there are two large categories in market issuance that are down more that are not included in billed issuance. So this is unrated debt as well as frequent issuers. So frequent issuers, we don't have in billed issuance because, as you know, they're on a fixed fee construction up to a certain level of volume. So therefore, we expect billed issuance to be significantly higher than market issuance for the full year 2023.OperatorOur next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets.Ashish SabadraI just wanted to focus on the individual segment guidance. You raised the guidance for Commodity Insights, Mobility and Indices. I understand MI is more towards the lower end. But even on the Ratings front, it looks like the billed issuance guidance was raised by almost 1 point. Earlier, it was 2% to 6%, now it's 3% to 7%, so -- but you reiterated the full year guidance. So I was just wondering, within the full year guidance, do you have increased confidence towards -- on the range? Any color on that front will be helpful.Ewout Lucien SteenbergenYes, thank you. We are overall really confident around the outlook for the full year. We are very pleased, of course, with the results in the first quarter and then also the confidence around what we are going to achieve for the full year. And you see that reflected in the overall guidance that, as you have noted, is unchanged. But you have to realize that we're taking out 2 months of Engineering Solutions revenues and earnings. So you could say implicitly, we've slightly raised our full year guidance. And then by division, as you were asking for, the changes are due to the following. If you look at Commodity Insights, that is driven really by the outperformance of revenue growth in the first quarter. If you look at Mobility, strong growth in the first quarter. But also the acquisition of Market Scan is helping there from a revenue perspective. And Indices as well, what we are seeing there is also a very strong first quarter. And that is, therefore, also reflected in the full year revenue growth outlook. In terms of Ratings, there is a shift that we have told you, a little bit higher transactional revenue but a little bit lower non-transactional revenue, so net-net, still the same. But there is a shift in those two underlying categories. And then with respect to margins, Mobility has been tuned down a bit. That is the dilutive effect of the acquisition. But on the flip side, for the Indices business, we see that the margins are actually up, given the strong performance in the first quarter again. With respect to Market Intelligence, we have said that we come in more at the lower end of the ranges, both for revenues and margins. And that has to do with the macro environment, a bit of the uncertainty, the fact that we expect some of the capital markets products more to come back later in the year because now we assume the recession somewhere mid of this year as well as some of the impact of the banking crisis, although we think that impact will be really minimal for Market Intelligence.Ashish SabadraThat was very helpful color. And maybe as a follow-up, if I can follow up on the Mobility front, manufacturing, in particular, was very strong. Overall growth in Mobility was very strong, but manufacturing historically, which has been more in the 3% to 4% range, was up 11% this quarter. So I was wondering, has anything changed there structurally which is driving significantly stronger growth in that segment?Douglas L. PetersonYes. Thank you, Ashish. What's driving growth in that segment, if you recall, over the last couple of years, there was -- the supply chains have been disrupted. There were no access to different types of chips, which are used in the automotive sector, including even things like key fobs. And you also saw a lot of disruption in demand from the market as people are looking for cars, but they couldn't get them. So we're seeing that manufacturing is up. In fact, our total vehicle sales globally, we're seeing very strong sales coming up in the U.S., over -- about 7.5% growth; in China, about 6% growth; in Asia, including Japan and South Korea, about 6.5% growth; and in Europe, about 7.5% growth. So across the board, we see a lot of growth in production as well as -- coming from a very, very depressed base and -- but at the same time, it puts some pressure because the demand is starting to decrease as well, given the inflation, given interest rates are going up. So we see that right now, there's a lot of demand for information from our Mobility team because we provide the forecasting. We provide the information about the changes going on in the industry as well as the day-to-day dynamics. But we're shifting the dynamics from what had been a supply-constrained market to a richer approach, to more supply in the market and shifts in customer demand. But all of this benefits our Mobility business because they provide the data and analytics that dealers and OEMs and suppliers need to make decisions.Ashish SabadraThat was very helpful color. And congrats on such a strong momentum in the business.Douglas L. PetersonThank you.OperatorGeorge Tong with Goldman Sachs.Keen Fai TongI wanted to focus on the Ratings side of the business. The revenues there declined mid-single digits year-over-year. And that came in much better than your main competitor, which saw an 11% decline. What are some of the factors that you believe drove this outperformance in delta in the quarter? And can these factors persist over the remainder of this year?Douglas L. PetersonThank you, George. Well, first of all, this was a very lumpy quarter. When you look at the issuance, it started out quite strong of issuance. Investment grade had started off strong. But through the quarter in the U.S., it declined 14%. In Europe, it increased 3%. High yield increased in the U.S. 20%, but it decreased in Europe, 2%. And structured finance in the U.S. decreased 48%. And in Europe, it increased 7%. So this was an incredibly lumpy quarter for us. But we've been very adamant about having our salespeople and our commercial people out in the markets. We keep our finger to the pulse of what's happening across the markets. We've been involved in supplying information for the structured credit area, in particular, CLOs. We've been strong in the CLO market in the last quarter. We see going forward, we think that for the rest of the year that it's going to be mostly refinancing that's going to drive what we see as the issuance. If you take a step back in last quarter, we issued a slide, which we show once a year, which is the pipeline of refinancing, which is on the balance sheet of companies, financial institutions and other organizations over the next 5 to 10 years. And you can see there was a lot of financing that took place over the last 10 years with typically 5-, 7-, sometimes up to 10-year maturity. That's starting to mature now. And we're starting to see some of that pull forward. And the question is what are the right conditions for people to come back to the market? And that's something we're watching very closely. Because there is a very, very large pipeline of refinancing that's going to be coming over the next 3 to 5 years. And we're going to watch that carefully, including what's going to be coming this year.Keen Fai TongGot it. That's helpful. And then I wanted to ask about your synergy realization. You realized run rate synergies on the cost side of a little over $550 million and then $50 million-plus on the revenue side. Can you dive into where you're seeing most traction with revenue and cost synergy utilization and how you expect the progression to continue over the course of this year?Ewout Lucien SteenbergenOf course, George. Thank you so much. We are, of course, very pleased with the progress we're making with synergies. This is really a statement of execution of the whole team, of the whole company. And the speed of the implementation of all of our programs is really impressive from my perspective. So we are at $550 million run rate cost synergies at this moment. These are cost synergies we're doing in all the categories that we have outlined before. There's, of course, organizational duplication of roles that we are taking care of, then there's real estate consolidation, vendor consolidation and several other categories. This is all linked to integration. So we like to get the integration behind us as quickly as possible and that we can fully operate as a combined company going forward. And we are very close to that point now. And that is expressed by the progress we have made with cost synergies and getting really now not too far away anymore from the $600 million cost synergy mark. And so this is all across the company. With respect to revenue synergies, we see very nice progress in the divisions. The largest growth there we see in Market Intelligence and Commodity Insights but contributions by all of the divisions. We have always said from the beginning that revenue synergies will take more time. At this moment, the focus is mostly on cross-sell. And then later this year and the next few years, we will shift to new product development. But obviously, the lead time to develop new products and do the system enhancements for that will take a bit longer. But both on cost and revenue synergies, we're very pleased where we are at this moment.OperatorOur next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.Toni Michele KaplanI wanted to talk about ESG first. Thanks for the quarterly disclosure. We have seen some slowdown in new sales from a competitor of yours talking about the political and regulatory landscape. Have you also noticed any change in investor behavior in ESG, particularly in the new sales? Any areas that are slower versus more resilient? Because I know it's sort of a topic that spans your whole business. So maybe there are some areas that are doing fine and resilient versus others that maybe you are noticing a new sales change.Douglas L. PetersonThank you, Toni. I'm going to start and then hand it over to Ewout. If you take a step back and you think about something like the ESG, sustainability, climate markets, they go back the last 5, 6, 7 years. And if you look at our company, we have products that go back 50, 65, 100 years. And the experience of a market like this, it's really changing rapidly. And fortunately, because of our Sustainable1 organization and the way that we've been investing in sustainability products, energy transition, climate, ESG across our entire company and coordinating it through S1, we're seeing strength across pretty much the entire portfolio. And in particular, we've seen a shift away from ESG to climate in the U.S. around the rest of the globe. One of the things that I always say is that the train has left the station on this. This is an area that's going to be growing very quickly. It's high demand. It's coming from corporates. It's coming from governments, from regulators, from financial institutions, every part of the financial institution area. And we have products from Trucost, our ESG data suite. We've got bond referencing prices, physical risk. We're in the middle of what I'd say is one of the most important dialogues taking place with the regulators around the globe about disclosure. But let me hand it over to Ewout to talk a little bit more about the numbers.Ewout Lucien SteenbergenToni, when we look at the first quarter revenues for sustainability and energy transition, we actually think that this is really strong for the company. And we are still confident that for the full year outlook, the growth will be in line with our medium-term expectations. And the reason for that is, as Doug outlined, that we have very diverse revenue streams underneath sustainability and energy transition. And all of our divisions contribute to the progress and to the growth. So think about, for example, in Mobility, what is happening, the huge transformation of the industry around electrification, move to EVs, and what that means for the OEMs with respect to thinking about supply chains and new manufacturing and where they source the batteries, what is happening in the commodity space with energy transition, what is happening with new Price Assessments around hydrogen and carbon and biofuels and recycled plastics, what is happening in the Ratings space with Second Party Opinions. And then Doug already mentioned climate. Really, there is so much focus now about climate, climate analytics, climate credit analytics, climate data. Just to give you one data point, Trucost actually grew more than 50% in the quarter. So overall, if we add it up, I think we have very strong revenue streams. And therefore, we are confident about our future growth in this industry and this particular growth area.Toni Michele KaplanPerfect. And hoping you could, on another topic, just give us an update on how you're utilizing AI or any of your other advancements in technology, whether it be through Kensho or other areas as well?Ewout Lucien SteenbergenToni, the way how we look at it is we really believe we are ahead of the game here. We did the acquisition of Kensho 5 years ago, when just very few people were thinking about artificial intelligence. We have already embedded a lot of Kensho's products and tools within our businesses over the last few years. And our intention is really to stay ahead and to really make sure that we continue to implement this and be one of the winners in this market. We told you this morning, we have now five Kensho products that are in the market that is for external customers. But internally, there are many more products. And actually, the efficiency opportunities that have Kensho -- that Kensho has created for the divisions is very large. Maybe if I may expand on this in one particular area. If you think about large language models and generative AI, actually three areas are really critical. It is compute, which is really expensive. Then there are the algorithms, which are more open source and generic. And then it is about training data. And training data is really differentiating. And if you have really good training data, you can improve the algorithms and you can drive down the compute cost. We have, as S&amp;P, the largest training dataset for financial markets plus the best team of Kensho that we already outlined. So we have no need to export our data to someone's else models or generic large language models. We can do this in-house. And you may expect that we will have more announcements around this later this year.OperatorOur next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.Alexander KrammJust wanted to come back to the Market Intelligence commentary and the outlook there. Clearly, you sound a little bit more cautious. Although Doug, I think initially you said it should be fine. But I think Ewout's comments are clearly pointing towards the low end. So I guess, the question is what specifically is it that makes you think lower end? I mean, is it just an expectation of a slowdown? Or is it actually something that you're already seeing in new sales? Was just curious about if this is more an expectation or something you're already seeing in the pipeline, I guess, is -- because obviously, the uncertain environment. And then specifically, you mentioned the Swiss bank merger, which obviously is something I'm paying attention to as well. I was just wondering, you said it wouldn't have an impact. But is it a question about maybe this year not an impact because it may take some time? Or is it just the exposures are very small? Just maybe you can dimensionalize it a little bit since it is the first time we've had something like this in like 15 years.Ewout Lucien SteenbergenYes. Alex, this is Ewout. I will start and then hand it over to Doug. Generally, we are confident about the outlook of Market Intelligence for the remainder of the year due to a couple of reasons. The first is growth of the subscription book of business. We see some healthy growth. Then we have good revenue synergies that will come in over the next period of time. We are expecting a capital markets recovery at the end of the year. So that should help Enterprise Solutions. And then also the comps will become easier and FX headwinds will become easier during the course of this year. So those are the elements that will help us to remain confident with the outlook. With respect to the specifics of the banking impact, we think this is overall manageable and not material for Market Intelligence. And the reason for that is the following. Market Intelligence actually has a very diverse customer base. Only 10% of the customer revenue is coming from commercial banks. And these are global commercial banks, so not specifically U.S. or Europe. So that's actually a relatively low percentage. And then we have multiyear subscription contracts with those customers. And we have tuned it down in the guidance range to the lower end of the range given the uncertainty, given the fact that we are still expecting a shallow and short recession in the mid of this year, and we want to be cautious. But overall, that's why we still believe we should be able to come in within the range for Market Intelligence for the full year.Douglas L. PetersonAlex, what I wanted to add is that I've been on the road almost nonstop this year and seeing clients. And it's been incredible, the kind of feedback we're getting about the value that the Market Intelligence team is bringing with the data that's getting built into different platforms. And what Ewout just highlighted that Market Intelligence customer base is very diversified, we don't just have a financial institution client base, and within financial institutions, we're not just focused on only one single segment. So I've had really interesting conversations with corporates about the data that we have in Market Intelligence, what we can provide in Investor Relations, core data, which is used by different traders, by supply chain. We have a new product, which is a supply chain console that corporates are finding incredibly useful for them to understand what would be their needs for managing shipping, supply chain risk, et cetera. So I'm really encouraged by what we're seeing. The client dialogue is what I wanted to highlight.Alexander KrammAll right. And then just a very quick one on the Ratings side, and I asked your primary competitor this also, but maybe you have a different view, which is really what's going to happen with lending by regional banks, right? I mean, I know they're more focused on middle market. And that's not really where you play. But if we make the assumptions that these companies are going to be more constrained because of regulation or capital requirements, is there an opportunity for you? Are you thinking about an opportunity that could lead to more disintermediation, that you actually have a role as that remaining lending in the U.S. may more go to capital markets? Or is it just too small for you and it will go to other channels, like private credit, for example?Douglas L. PetersonYes. Thanks for that, Alex. Well, first of all, we have much, much lower exposure to that sector than some of the other competitors in our space. We do watch it very closely because it does help with some of the -- understanding some of the credit dynamics in the country overall. We do see in the U.S. that there could be some slowdown in credit. And that's one of the reasons that we've been cautious about our own economic forecast for the rest of the year. You heard Ewout said that we expect that there would be a mild recession or a mild slowdown as we see a dip in the second or third quarter. And we think part of that could be caused by the slowdown in credit. But overall, we have very low exposure to this area. And it's likely that some of the areas that we see that the credit will get picked up by the private markets or securitization. And some of those, we might actually benefit from some of the activity on those.OperatorOur next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.Craig Anthony HuberCan you touch on, if you would, your outlook for bank loan issuance this year and high-yield issuance, just given the huge uncertainties on the macro side, please?Douglas L. PetersonThanks, Craig. Well, let me give you a broader sense of issuance and just reconcile a little bit what we talked about earlier on the call. As you know, we have our credit research team, issues a report on what they see as the full forecast for the year. And right now, they're expecting that the range across all of the different areas would be down about 3.5%. And then we've said that we think that our -- what the range of billed issuance will be up about 3% to 7%. We don't break it out between what would be leveraged loans and high yield. Those are part of that. But in the first quarter, high-yield issuance was up about 6% of billed issuance and bank loans was down about 33%. In many cases, those are substitutes for each other. Sometimes you can see somebody says, ""Well, am I going to issue a floating rate or a fixed rate? What are the market conditions? Or am I going to go to the private markets, which have been quite quick? They're fast. But they also have, in some cases, higher spreads on them as well as maybe more covenants."" But we think that there's going to be a very dynamic market. Overall, I think you should focus on the 3% to 7% billed issuance up and look at the different components of where we see that's happening. Just as an FYI, in our credit research team's forecast, they see that corporates will be up about 8.5% for the year. So think of that as kind of an anchor. And also remember what I said earlier to one of the earlier questions about the amount of refinancing that is already taking place. Maybe the last point I'd make is that we see that in this market with these conditions, with some uncertainty about rates and inflation, et cetera, issuance is very, very opportunistic. You can see a flood of issuance over a week or 2 weeks. And then sometimes the markets are pulling back. For instance, the last couple of weeks have been very encouraging. But we said the same thing about the first 2 months of the year. So we watch this closely. We're forecasting. But go back to what the long-term issue is, M&amp;A is going to come back, rates will eventually stabilize, conditions will be positive for people to invest and grow. We have these massive programs in the U.S. that are just starting to get launched. For the infrastructure bill, for the CHIPS Act, for the IRA, the capital that's going to be going into energy transition, all of that is going to attract investment. It's going to attract M&amp;A. It's going to attract debt investment. This isn't just going to be done using capital from the government. There's going to be a public-private partnership, public-private capital going into these areas. And I just see a huge amount of capital that's going to be deployed here. We're going to see the same thing in Europe, same thing in Asia. So I just believe that this energy transition, what we're going to see with the CHIPS Act, et cetera, is going to create a lot of investment globally. And we should be benefiting from all of that over the long run.Craig Anthony HuberMy other question, please. Mobility, obviously, had a very strong start to the year, solid outlook for the rest of the year. Can you just touch upon any of the businesses within that division that you think will help drive it for the rest of the year? And any significant changes from the trends you saw in the first quarter that you think might go better or worse as the year goes on, [sub business]?Ewout Lucien SteenbergenWe're actually really looking positively for all the underlying revenue drivers within Mobility. First, when you look at dealers, you see a little bit two effects going in opposite directions, as Doug explained earlier. So maybe their margins are coming down a bit. Inventory levels are going up. So therefore, retention is a little bit lower. But on the flip side is that there's more demand for sales and marketing products because they need to be more proactively reaching out to potential customers in the future. So that is actually driving the growth in the dealership. Moreover, I think CARFAX is super entrepreneurial, really innovative, launching a lot of new products. And that is helping with the growth there as well. Manufacturing, the same thing. Also there, they are exposed to more need to really reach out to customers through our marketing and sales product. So that is going to be helpful there as well. Plus all the changes that are happening with the transformation to EVs and our planning products there are helping our OEM customers. And then our data is flowing to insurance companies, to banks and other loan entities that need the data for the pricing of their products. So that we expect that to continue to grow as well at healthy levels during the course of this year. So overall, I would say positive momentum for Mobility. And I have no reason to believe that, that would not continue in the future.OperatorOur next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.Jeffrey Marc SilberI know it's late. I'll just ask one. Nobody has asked about the pricing environment. And I know it varies by the different segments you're in. But if you can just give us some general comments in terms of the ability to pass through pricing, would appreciate it.Ewout Lucien SteenbergenAbsolutely, Jeff. So the way we look at this is most of our products are must-have products for our customers. We are deeply embedded in their workflows, in their day-to-day activities. Therefore, we add a lot of value to our customers. And that should give us an opportunity to pass on any cost price increases as a result of the inflationary environment in terms of pricing and fees. But obviously, we're doing that in a very responsible way. We're doing that in a very balanced way that will come in gradually over time at the moments of contract renewals. But overall, we think that is reasonable to pass on cost price increases to customers. And therefore, we still expect to expand margins in this current environment. I'm looking at maybe one of my colleagues, Dan or Saugata, if you would like to give any particular color for your businesses.Daniel Eugene DraperJeff, it's Dan. Thank you very much for the question. Look, I think to echo Ewout's comments, we align pricing with the value we create for our customers. And if you look at something specifically for indices, I mean, this massive secular growth trend switch from active to passive management, that's something that we want to be aligned with our clients and ensure that, again, we're representing the value and really working closely.And I think if you look at the outcome, we estimate over the last 26 years from our 3 core indices, the S&amp;P 500, 400 and 600, that we saved investors over $400 billion in management fees. So that's benefiting directly savers, retirees, people saving for college education, things like that. So I think pricing is a strategic tool that we look through and really use, again, to align growth and interest with clients.OperatorOur next question comes from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer.Owen LauSo going back to Kensho, Doug and Ewout, you mentioned 5 products are commercially available. Could you please talk about the early traction there and your expectation about these products? Who are your major clients? Would that be banks or you can expand to other verticals? And also please remind us the revenue model. Is it mainly a subscription-based model?Ewout Lucien SteenbergenThanks, Owen. I will give you a more broader perspective and then hand it over to Saugata for some specific Kensho implementations in Commodity Insights. So overall, Kensho for the last few years has been very much focused on product development, speed to market, new product design, new design of delivery, customer experience within S&amp;P Global. But slowly, it's now also turning more externally again because many of those products that have been developed are also attractive for external customers.Overall, if you look at the value that is generated, it's both value internally and externally. In terms of external customers, we have now more than 50 external customers in areas like asset managers, large banks, hedge funds and corporates. And this is all the products that we have highlighted before, Link, NERD, Scribe, Extract and Classify, so many good products. But let me hand it over to Saugata to give you more details about Commodity Insights.Saugata SahaThanks, Ewout, and Owen, thanks for the question. I describe the work that we do with Kensho, and more broadly, the concept of AI across Commodity Insights as a foundational piece of everything that we are doing that's future-looking and growth-driving. So Kensho, for example, built a tool that we use in our -- what we call the price assessment process, specifically the Market on Close process wherein we kind of, at the end of the day, pull together everything we've heard during the closing out of the trading markets to understand what's the outlook for price.And Kensho built a tool that compressed the workflow time by about 70%. That frees up time for our researchers, for our price reporters to do other productive things for our customers and also helps us get information out to the market faster.In addition, AI is a broader theme. We do a lot of work, and I draw your attention to some of our newer products like Energy Studio: Impact, which is essentially 6 million North America wells, of which for about 1 million wells we do real-time live forecast. And you can imagine that something like that involves more than 1 trillion rows of data. And computing that without leveraging AI, machine learning models, and we have about 4,200 of them in that one product alone, would be nearly impossible. And that's just one example where we are using -- just, I would say, 2 examples where we are using Kensho and machine learning and artificial intelligence concepts more broadly to develop and demonstrate additional customer value.Owen LauGot it. That's very helpful. And then on Indices, on the expense, I think it was lower than our expectation, but the margin was higher. Was it mainly driven by lower comp because your revenue line is lower? And also, could you please give us an update on your key maybe market and also your investment or expense assumption for the rest of this year on Indices?Daniel Eugene DraperYes. Thanks again for the question. I think in terms of the performance, as Ewout had mentioned, we had the difficult comps, but also the asset prices and our asset-linked. If you think back, you kind of build that in arrears that was -- quarter was coming off of the market highs at the end of 2021, so comparing that. And also, there was some seasonality in products like the S&amp;P 500. You do see the liquidity benefits of that product are really seeing inflows late in the year, and that can come out early through the year on that.Where we saw the outperformance was in exchange-traded derivatives. Obviously, we've seen a very fast increase in nominal interest rates, and that's really caused some dislocation in the way that risk premium across asset classes. And so that's obviously increased volatility. So we're so well positioned in this ecosystem we built, what we discussed back in the Investor Day in December, being able to align and provide price discovery, liquidity and then crucially for the exchange-traded derivative market, being able to manage risks.And so what we're seeing is a combination of secular growth trends there, extended trading hours, shorting down to intraday or even single day types of access to derivative products. But there's also cyclicality. We do know that over time, volatility will particularly normalize, potentially mean revert to some degree. So in terms of our outlook, we want to make sure that we manage that appropriately.So if you think about the margin, just kind of looking for the rest of the year, we do like exchange-traded derivatives. They do have a higher gross margin than our asset-linked, but we do expect that mix to change. We do expect, hopefully, the flows to change that. So it's going to be reflected in the revenue mix we have. Also, we had some onetime expenses that were nonrecurring. And we also had some lapping incentive comp expense reductions last year.But what we really want to do ultimately is to reinvest back in the business. And I think that reflects, again, the way we're thinking about the margin for the rest of the year and really leaning into, again, the secular growth trends we have.OperatorOur next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.Andrew Charles SteinermanEwout, I know this is a small item, but it would help our model. Could you just give us what the total acquired, that's the M&amp;A revenues, were in the first quarter? I definitely heard you call out the one point of M&amp;A revenues in Mobility from Market Scan. But as you know, there's been some other kind of tuck-ins already completed. And if you could also, on the same basis, with the acquisitions already completed, could you give us what the M&amp;A revenue assumption is for the '23 guide?Ewout Lucien SteenbergenAndrew, we said that for Market Scan, during the quarter, the impact is around 1 point. So it's around $3 million to $4 million. It's overall immaterial for the company as a whole, as you understand. The other 2 sides in ChartIQ really are immaterial for Market Intelligence. So from a modeling perspective, I wouldn't put any number into your model.But then I would like to point out that the revenues and the earnings we'll lose in our models and our plan for the full year by divesting Engineering Solutions 2 months earlier is actually net-net going to reduce the overall impact on our plan. So the net of divestiture of Engineering Solutions and the new acquisitions is actually a negative, hence, my comment earlier during this call that implicitly, we're raising the guidance for the full year by holding the range the same for the company as a whole.Andrew Charles SteinermanRight. But you do account for all of the M&amp;A, right?Ewout Lucien SteenbergenYes. Yes, that's correct.OperatorOur next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird.Jeffrey P. MeulerDoug, Ewout, good to hear from you, but I'll try to continue to incorporate some of those other voices. Within Indices, maybe if you could talk about, I guess, like your Vitality or what new products are really resonating or you think have the highest potential?Daniel Eugene DraperJeff, thanks for the question. In terms of Vitality, we think that sustainability was a theme, I think, Doug and Ewout both kind of emphasize. That's a huge opportunity for us particularly as we expand to other regions, Europe, Asia. That's always top of mind for us.I'd also say a factor is thematics, and specifically, if you think about the need for income globally. So for us, having the leading dividend, equity dividend franchise, our aristocrats, we're seeing a lot of demand there.If you think about in developed markets, aging populations, the need for retirement income, but hey, now there's inflation. So all of a sudden, I need to protect capital in standards of living. So that's where the combination of using, say, our S&amp;P 500 equity franchise to supplement fixed income. That's clearly a big synergy from the IHS Markit and specifically our iBoxx franchise.So what we're seeing now is combining like around the world kind of that dividend franchise we have with credit and being able to offer now multi-asset solutions. And particularly in markets like Japan, one of our largest asset management clients just launched the first multi-asset ETF in that marketplace. So again, really bringing synergy capabilities.But I think income leading into that, also in sustainability, looking to combine really the partnership within S&amp;P Global. Even Saugata's business in Commodity Insights, we've been able to use unique proprietary datasets around electric vehicles. I think Ewout had mentioned, we came out in partnership, again, with Commodity Insights with our GSCI franchise to come out with an electric vehicles metal index, again, other datasets with Trucost and sustainability.So I think this is really -- as we go back to that 2025, 2026 outlook we gave at Investor Day, this is really looking through increasingly these proprietary datasets being part of S&amp;P Global to really look at some of these mega trends around the world.Jeffrey P. MeulerAnd then on Commodity Insights, there was a comment about an opportunity to further sector leadership. Maybe just a high-level comment, like how is CERAWeek different with IHS here being part of S&amp;P now? And then should we look to the event as a meaningful cross-selling catalyst, if you can just talk about the pipeline build coming out of the event?Saugata SahaJeff, thanks for the question. So just as a reminder, CERAWeek is the marquee energy event that we hold and it's increasing broadly more than energy event that we hold in Houston in March every year. It is the premier -- as you pointed out, it is the premier venue for thought leadership for commodities and everything future looking for the commodities business. This year, we had over 8,000 attendees there, a lot of C-suite executives, important policymakers across the world.And I'd say, if you think about CERAWeek, we obviously want to grow the franchise in a meaningful way that is accretive to the overall business and the business plan that we have laid out. We do get a lot of -- it's not a venue where we sell. It's not designed to be a venue where we sell. But it is a venue where we showcase our thought leadership, showcase our talent and showcase all of the great work that we are doing and kind of driving answers to some of the most complicated questions out there.And the 4 themes that came out this year, which also helps us shape the research that we do because we have this audience where we connect with, this community that we've built where we connect with them, and that helps us guide research that we want to do, products that we want to do.And I'd say the 4 things that we took away that's going to help us shape our own strategy, number one is energy transition is here to stay. It's not going away. Number two, energy transition is complicated because customers are trying to balance energy transition, energy security and energy affordability. Third, I'd say customers are upbeat. They're looking for solutions to complex problems, which only data and analytics of that sort that we can provide can help them solve. And fourth, I'd say we walked away with targeted opportunities that we want to work on and build opportunities to serve clients.So I'd say in summary, Jeff, it's less about the cross-sell opportunity but more about the sense of community we build, the direct revenues that we generate and, of course, what we showcase and what we walk away from the conference in terms of the knowledge that we build and how to shape our business.And the last thing I would add that -- of course, CERAWeek is our marquee event, but we also have other leading events like the World Petrochemical Conference. There's nothing else like the thought for the petrochemicals business or the London Energy Forum or the newly acquired Fujairah conference, which we call FUJCON. And all of them in combination with -- especially the merger, helps us interact with customers in a way that would not otherwise be possible.OperatorOur next question comes from Russell Quelch with Redburn.Russell QuelchFollowing on from the previous question actually, unless I'm wrong, I haven't seen any new products in the fixed income benchmark index space from S&amp;P yet post the acquisition of IHS. I did hear Dan's comments earlier, but can you be more specific about the time to market for new fixed income index products leveraging the brand and S&amp;P's rich dataset on the corporate side, particularly? Do you have sort of aspirations to challenge (inaudible) in that market? Any sort of further comments you can give there? And I guess -- so the question being how much does new product growth drive the 10% medium-term target in the index business, please.Daniel Eugene DraperYes. Thanks for the question. No, we actually have hit -- I think probably one of the most notable products in Europe was our Paris-Aligned Climate Transition launch in fixed income. And so that aligns already what we've done in equity. So that was something we got to market. And now -- there's now demand, as we call it, the PACT Indices, to do those in other parts of the world and other kind of regional exposures, whether it be emerging markets, global, what have you. So that was a really important product and index that we got to market.As I mentioned as well, multi-asset is really, really important for us, too, so to align, again, the iBoxx range, for example, investment grade, high yield, but to put that more intentionally alongside our leading equity franchises. So being able to do that on a channel basis, particularly areas like insurance, if you think about the annuity space, being able to go specifically there where multi-asset demand -- it's also a channel historically that's had a lot of active management.So this bigger trend of shifting from active to passive. We are a leader in that space, but it's early days. Can we expand kind of our first mover advantage to again bring the iBoxx capabilities. And again, we've already launched products, I mentioned, in Japan on multi-asset. We have development moving forward really across the globe. But I'd say insurance is interesting. Retirement, I'd mentioned as well, another area that, in some areas, historically have been very actively oriented. Again, combining fixed income with equity is where we want to be able to move forward as a competitive place.Ewout Lucien SteenbergenAnd then let me add one part, and that is with respect to the last part of the question around the total contribution of new products to the top line growth of the company. We said at Investor Day, as you might recall, about 80 basis points of contribution to overall growth for the company from the new initiatives. And obviously, our focus is to continue to see that developing further in the future. Therefore, Vitality is such an important metric for us because it is an indicator of healthy innovation within S&amp;P Global. But I just would like to point out that products will rotate off from the Vitality Index after 3 to 5 years because at some point, they are not a new product anymore, and they will become business as usual.But the last piece of information I want to give in terms of the health of innovation around Vitality is we have seen double-digit Vitality levels within our businesses this quarter from Market Intelligence, from Mobility, from Commodity Insights and from Indices. So very positive all across the board.Russell QuelchGreat stuff. So maybe just as a follow-up. I heard all the comments around investment and synergies, particularly Dan's comments around investments. So just wondering if you can speak to the seasonality you expect in the cost line in 2023. Is that likely to be the same as the historical average or slightly different to previous years?Ewout Lucien SteenbergenRussell, there's 2 kinds of investments in new initiatives. There is investments in our strategic programs, our strategic investment program of $150 million. You should assume that, that comes in gradually over time, so no particular seasonality. And then we are making investments, what we called cost to achieve, which are related to revenue synergies and realization of revenue synergies. Those will come in also over time, but those are pulled out from a performance perspective. So those you won't see in the actual performance results, the non-GAAP results that we're already reporting now and in the future.OperatorOur next question comes from Simon Clinch with Atlantic Equities.Simon Alistair Vaughan ClinchI wanted to ask a question really about the competitive environment and just your comments about your lengthening sales cycles and the stresses that are facing the financial services customers. I was wondering, are you seeing any sort of competitive response or would you expect to see any responses on pricing from the industry overall? And how would you expect to fare and -- if that were to happen?Douglas L. PetersonThank you, Simon. This is Doug. Well, first of all, as you know, we've always been in a competitive environment, and we also respect our competitors very, very much. This is an environment where for us, it's up to bringing the most relevant, the newest, the fastest, the highest quality information, being responsive, as you've heard us talk about Kensho, artificial intelligence, machine learning. All of these types of things allow us to bring information and data and analytics and benchmarks to our customers even faster.So it's a very competitive environment. This also puts us on the -- it keeps us on our toes. It makes us better because we have to always respond to the demands of the markets as well as ensuring that we're faster and ahead of all of our competitors.Simon Alistair Vaughan ClinchOkay. And just as a follow-up then. When we think about the revenue synergies and revenue synergies target, I was just wondering, in terms of -- should we expect there to be any sort of cyclical puts or takes to those targets over time? Like if we were to endure a long downturn, does that impact the -- I guess, the timing of the recognition of those revenue synergies? And maybe just some flavor around that would be useful.Ewout Lucien SteenbergenYes. We have said revenue synergies, Simon, are coming in over a period of 3 to 5 years, about 45% cross-sell, which is more the first 2 years; and then 55% coming from new products, which is more year 3 to 5. So you should see this actually -- see that ramping up over the next period during the course of this year. And you saw actually quite a nice jump from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, and we're now at that $52 million run rate level. But you see that going up in quite a nice way over the next couple of quarters. But obviously, revenue synergies take more time to accomplish compared to cost synergies.OperatorOur final question will come from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies.Stephanie Lynn Benjamin MooreMaybe taking a high-level view of just this year and your expectations embedded in your guidance. I think you called out that it does call for a bit of an improvement or somewhat of a macro recovery in the back half. Just trying to think of the levers or opportunities you have to pull, say, maybe the macro ends up being a bit weaker. If you could talk about some of those levers as well as some of the countercyclicality of your business in the various segments, that would be helpful.Ewout Lucien SteenbergenYes. Thanks, Stephanie. Our expectation now in terms of assumptions for the year is the following: obviously, strong performance in the first quarter, as you have seen; then more a short and shallow recession in second quarter, third quarter. Obviously, we're still very careful on what to expect for the year, that there's not some unexpected volatility happening in the market. So we are actually running a very tight ship, very careful from expenses and investments, headcount, very careful. But then we are ready to invest because the most important is that we are investing in future growth. And hopefully, we will see somewhere at the end of the third quarter and the fourth quarter, really, markets coming back in a very strong way, and we're ready to take advantage of that.In terms of downturn levers that we have, it's the usual list that we have always been outlining. And you know that we're on top of our game, and we'll pull those levers if needed. But already today, as you have seen, the cost controls are really very strong, and the cost growth is really low. Certainly also, if you take it into account of that last year, we had actually flat expenses and now only really minimal expense growth in the first quarter.But the downturn levers are the usual one around variable spend, discretionary spend, hiring, investment spend in other areas. So we are ready to take action if that's needed. But hopefully, we are more in a position that we can invest in future growth because that's the real fun part and the part how we really can deliver shareholder value from a medium and long-term perspective.Douglas L. PetersonThank you, Stephanie. I'd like to make a quick closing remark. And I want to thank everybody for being on the call today and your excellent questions. I also want to thank Dan and Saugata for joining us in the room. Great answers. It's nice to have you here. And we're also very pleased with how our year has started. As you recall, in December, we had an Investor Day where we launched a new strategy called Powering Global Markets. And it's fantastic to be off such a strong start. And a lot of that has to do with our engagement with our customers.We have been out talking to our customers, listening to them, understanding how they see the combined value of the company. And I personally have been very busy traveling around the world, speaking with our key customers from every industry from all of our businesses, and I'm more confident than ever about our strategy. And their comments provide us further information to validate our priorities, our investment in technology, our investment in AI, the quality of our people, how we see the products that we're developing in the future. And I'm just so confident about what we're seeing out there.I also want to thank all of our people for helping us launch 2023. As always, they are phenomenal, and it's why we're off to such a strong start. And so I'm really excited about everything we have achieved this year. I look forward to sharing more on our next earnings call. And again, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Thank you very much.OperatorThat concludes this morning's call.

Approximately 37% of the world's population remains entirely offline, while millions more don't have access to a reliable internet connection. In this video, Don McGuire, Senior Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer, and Kirti Gupta, Chief Economist and Vice President, Technology &amp; Economic Strategy, discuss how 5G technology and innovations like 5G FWA (fixed wireless access) could hold the key to bridging the digital divide, giving more of the world's population access to improved educational and economic opportunities.In the developing world, mobile broadband has already played a crucial role in improving connectivity coverage and affordability, especially in countries where most people rely on mobile devices to access the internet. Now, 5G is paving the way to faster mobile broadband speeds and more reliable connections, and 5G FWA is primed to take that progress to the next level. 5G mmWave FWA offers ultra-low latency and multi-Gbps data rates, and can be utilized to deliver fast, reliable, and cost-efficient connectivity. Compared to fiber or fixed broadband, FWA builds on recent radio innovations that improve coverage, capacity, and speed. It's also an economical alternative to aging DSL networks and costly fiber deployments in both urban and rural areas.This discussion between Don McGuire and Kirti Gupta offers a firsthand look at how Qualcomm is leading the way in 5G technology and accelerating the global adoption of 5G FWA. We proudly support operators and OEMs worldwide as they work to solve critical challenges, including closing the digital divide with the roll-out of next-generation 5G networks. More than 40 OEMs are using Qualcomm 5G Fixed Wireless Access Platforms, with over 125 FWA designs announced or in development.

However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Specifically, we decided to study QUALCOMM's  ROE in this article.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for QUALCOMM How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for QUALCOMM is:63% = US$12b ÷ US$19b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.63.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.A Side By Side comparison of QUALCOMM's Earnings Growth And 63% ROETo begin with, QUALCOMM has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 19% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. As a result, QUALCOMM's exceptional 54% net income growth seen over the past five years, doesn't come as a surprise.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that QUALCOMM's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 27% in the same period, which is great to see.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is QCOM worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether QCOM is currently mispriced by the market.Is QUALCOMM Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?The three-year median payout ratio for QUALCOMM is 33%, which is moderately low. The company is retaining the remaining 67%. By the looks of it, the dividend is well covered and QUALCOMM is reinvesting its profits efficiently as evidenced by its exceptional growth which we discussed above.Besides, QUALCOMM has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 31% of its profits over the next three years. Still, forecasts suggest that QUALCOMM's future ROE will drop to 37% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with QUALCOMM's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

Its chip technology is the backbone of the 5G sphere, positioning Qualcomm for long-term success ahead in the sector.Its business had been on a roll until its most recent quarter, generating double-digit revenue growth. The lackluster results in the first quarter were due to a cyclical slowdown in mobile-phone sales and supply-chain challenges. Consequently, it reported a 12% drop in sales year-over-year to $9.46 billion and a 27% decline in net income to $2.68 billion. Nevertheless, its long-term prospects remain as bright as ever, with the stock likely to bounce back with aplomb in the upcoming quarters. Forward estimates point to an 8% increase in revenue and EBITDA growth.Despite a recent surge in QCOM stock, its trades at just 3.5 times forward sales estimates, a rarity for a tech giant of its caliber.

Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseBaxter International Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Baxter International Inc. Quote Summing UpBaxter ended first-quarter 2022 on a positive note, wherein both revenues and earnings beat estimates. However, the company witnessed lower sales across five of its business units. Contraction in growth rates across two geographies — Americas and APAC — as well as in gross and operating margins is concerning. Unfavorable currency movement hurt the sales growth rate.Although majority of its segments ended in red, the company expects demand for its medically essential products to continue amid a stabilizing macroeconomic climate and healthcare marketplace. It stated that the ongoing transformational actions, announced earlier this year, will likely boost its performance going forward.The transformational actions, which include realigning its businesses and operations into four vertically integrated global business segments, are likely to complete by July 2024. Baxter is also progressing with the proposed spin-off of Kidney Care segment — comprising Renal Care and Acute Therapies product categories — into an independent, publicly traded company. This is also a part of its transformational actions.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Baxter carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Intuitive Surgical ISRG, Chemed CHE and Edwards Lifesciences EW, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

Analysts estimate $2.86 per share, according to Refinitiv.Baxter, which manufactures dialysis products and infusion pumps, reported quarterly revenue of $3.65 billion, slightly above analysts' average estimate of $3.60 billion.Sustained demand for company's medically essential products in combination with stabilizing macroeconomic environment and an improvement in recent supply chain challenges has helped boost quarterly sales, the company said.This compares with Baxter's comments from the last quarter results, when it flagged pressure from inflation and higher inventory costs to continue this year and had reduced up to 5% of its global workforce.On adjusted basis, the company earned 59 cents per share in the quarter through March, compared with analysts' average estimate of 49 cents per share.""The beat and raise to start 2023 is a step in the right direction for Baxter, with numbers hopefully only continuing to move up from here, and ultimately returning to prior trend levels,"" J.P.Morgan analyst Robbie Marcus said in a note.Spin-off of kidney care segment expected to occur by July 2024 or earlier, Baxter said.The company said in January it is also exploring alternatives for its biopharma solutions business, including a potential sale.

You can skip our detailed analysis and head straight to the list of 10 Countries With the Highest Standard of Living in 2023.To judge the quality of life for any country, the standard of living is one of the key indicators to look out for. While various factors contribute to the standard of living, like social services, education, and healthcare, it is often economic stability that is considered a major determinant. In this article, we will explore countries with the highest standard of living in 2023 and the study factors that contributed to their success.Deteriorating Global Economic CrisesLiving conditions in 90% of the world's countries worsened in 2021, according to the UN Development Program (UNDP). Moreover, the Human Development Index (HDI), which evaluates a country's health, education, and living standards, has witnessed a global decrease in these factors for the first time in its 32-year history. The trend has been observed for two consecutive years, particularly affecting regions such as Latin America, the Caribbean, Sub-Saharan Africa, and South Asia. As a result, progress towards the 2030 Agenda's Sustainable Development Goals has been significantly reversed, with human development levels regressing to those of 2016.In 2022, the economy of Europe and Central Asia witnessed a significant decline in their growth rate fueled by the Russia-Ukraine crisis, rising inflation, and the tightening of monetary policy and financial conditions that severely impacted private consumption, investment, and trade. Moreover, the increased food and energy prices resulted in inflation rates reaching levels never observed in the last two decades.For 2023, the anticipated growth rate of regional output for Europe and Central Asia has increased to 1.4%, much higher than the last forecast of 0.1%. The economy in the region has been observing a positive trend, although it remains severely affected. Story continuesThe improvement may have been caused by the less severe contraction of the Russian economy with a stronger and prosperous outlook for Ukraine. The region's average growth rate is expected to reach 2.7% over 2024-25, as inflation gradually subsides, domestic demand improves, and the external economic environment recovers.Countries around the globe, developed or developing, face grave economic challenges that directly affect their living standards. According to the World Bank's estimates, Turkiye was hit by two severe earthquakes on February 6, 2023, which caused direct damages amounting to around $34.2 billion, equivalent to 4% of the country's 2021 GDP. According to the National Institute for Economic and Social Research (NIESR), Britain is expected to be safe from recession in 2023. Still, its living standards will be hurt due to a surge in inflation, making it hard for some to pay their bills. The GDP growth forecast has been downgraded to 0.2% from 0.7%, with a further decrease to 1.0% in 2024. NIESR predicts that one in four households will need financial help for food and energy. Companies that promise improved living standards Despite depressive times globally, some public companies aim to contribute to improving living standards and quality of life for millions of people through different practices.For example, Procter &amp; Gamble Co (NYSE:PG) is dedicated to creating a water-positive future through sustainable practices and partnerships. Their ""River of Progress to 2030"" outlines their efforts to reduce water usage in manufacturing, innovate new solutions to water challenges, and support water restoration projects in 18 areas worldwide, including water-stressed metropolitan areas like Los Angeles. In a significant move amidst a global economic crisis, Novo Nordisknovo (NYSE:NVO) announced that it will reduce insulin prices in the US by up to 75% for individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes in January 2024. This is certainly a major step towards reducing the financial burden on patients and improving access to healthcare that may save the lives of thousands of people.Moreover, to elevate the social standing of women while addressing the issues of intersectionality, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) aims to have 50% of women in management positions globally, to achieve 35% ethnic and racial diversity in management positions within the U.S. Additionally, the company plans to grow the number of Black and African American employees in management positions in the U.S. by 50%.Trends in the countries with the highest standards of living in 2023A common trend observed in the countries with the highest standard of living in 2023 is that they have one of the most educated populations in the world. For example, Japan stands out for its strong education system, with many young adults holding tertiary qualifications.In 2021, 65% of 25-34 year-olds in Japan held a tertiary qualification, compared to the OECD average of 47%. While Japan spends less than the OECD average on pre-primary education institutions, the Japanese community still has a solid focus on the education sector, with 34% of funding coming from private sources.Another common trend observed is that most countries on the list have democratic governance systems with fair and free elections. According to an analysis conducted by Acemoglu, a professor at MIT, countries that transitioned to democratic forms of government in the last 70 years experienced significant economic growth. The study, which looked at 184 countries from 1960 to 2010, found that countries such as Portugal and South Korea saw a 20% increase in GDP per capita within 20 years of adopting democracy, on average. The findings suggest a correlation between the establishment of democratic governments and economic development.25 Countries with The Highest Standard of Living in 2023Boris Stroujko/Shutterstock.comMethodologyThe method utilized to compile the list of the 25 countries with the highest standards of living in 2023 involved two primary metrics, the Human Development Index (HDI) from the UN and the overall rankings for the Best Countries, as determined by US News. The rankings derived from the HDI and the Best Countries lists were averaged to generate an aggregate score, subsequently utilized to rank and identify the top 25 countries with the highest standard of living in 2023. Using standardized metrics allows for a comprehensive and data-driven approach to evaluating the living standards of the top 25 countries.25.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read Dividend Champions vs Aristocrats: 5 Under-the-Radar Stocks to Consider. Dividend Aristocrats are companies in the S&amp;P 500 Index that have increased their dividend payouts for at least 25 consecutive years. Meanwhile, ""Dividend Champions"" refers to companies that have increased their dividend payouts for at least 25 consecutive years but are not necessarily in the S&amp;P 500 Index.These companies are popular among investors as they typically have strong financials, stable earnings, and a proven track record of delivering value to their investors over time. Moreover, dividend stocks have also exhibited strong performance over the years, especially during market downturns. According to a report by Nuveen, companies that have raised their dividends perform well, compared with those that have high yields. The report mentioned that dividend growers with modest yields delivered a 26.8% return on equity in 2022, compared with a 20.4% return on stocks with yields above 3%. The report also referred to FactSet and mentioned that the MSCI World Index generated 5.5% dividend growth in 2022.When investing in dividend stocks, investors also pay attention to dividend-focused exchange-traded funds. These funds offer investors a diversified portfolio of dividend-paying stocks, which makes them an easy and reliable investment option. In 2022, investors poured over $47 billion in dividend ETFs, as reported by State Street Global Advisors. The report also mentioned that more than 90% of these funds outperformed the market last year. The report mentioned that the low fundamental volatility of dividend stocks is one of the main drivers for the outperformance of these strategies. Some of the best dividend stocks that have raised their dividends over the years include PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).Story continuesThe S&amp;P High-Yield Dividend Aristocrats tracks the performance of companies within the S&amp;P Composite 1500 that have raised their dividends for at least 20 years.

ABBV reported adjusted earnings of $2.46 per share for the first quarter of 2023, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate, which stood at $2.44 and $2.40, respectively. The reported earnings also exceeded the guidance of $2.31-$2.41. Earnings declined 22.2% year over year.ABBV’s revenues of $12.23 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate of $12.08 billion and $12.03 billion, respectively. Sales declined 9.7% year over year on a reported basis and 8.3% on an operational basis. The downside was caused by lower sales of Humira, Imbruvica and Juvederm. This decline was partially offset by the rise in product sales of key drugs like Rinvoq, Skyrizi, Botox and Vraylar.All growth rates mentioned below are on a year-on-year basis and at constant exchange rates (CER).Quarter in DetailIn immunology, AbbVie’s flagship drug Humira recorded a year-over-year sales decline of 24.3% to $3.54 billion on an operational basis. Sales in the United States declined 26.1% to $2.95 billion, while ex-U.S. market sales were down 14.8% on an operational basis to $593.0 million. The drug’s sales beat both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimates that were pegged at $3.44 billion and $3.45 billion, respectively.This substantial decline in Humira sales was due to the drug’s recent loss of exclusivity in the United States. Earlier this January, Amgen AMGN announced the launch of the first Humira biosimilar in the United States. The biosimilar is being marketed by Amgen under the trade name Amjevita. Like Amgen, several other companies like Biogen, Boehringer Ingelheim, Novartis NVS and Pfizer have received FDA approvals for their own Humira biosimilars, many of which are expected to be launched at various times this year per agreements with AbbVie. Last month, Novartis, through its Sandoz division, announced that the FDA approved its Humira biosimilar, which will be marketed under the trade name Hyrimoz. The Novartis division intends to market the drug in the United States from Jul 1, 2023. Humira had previously lost exclusivity in Europe in 2018.Story continuesNet revenues recorded from Skyrizi in the first quarter were $1.36 billion, up 46.3% on an operational basis year over year. This rise in sales is due to label expansions to the drug to include new patient populations in the last few quarters. Skyrizi sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimates of $1.45 billion and $1.43 billion, respectively.During the quarter, Rinvoq registered sales of $686 million, up 51.2% year over year on an operational basis. Rinvoq’s U.S. sales rose 44.4% year over year during the quarter, while ex-U.S. sales of the drug surged 64.9%. The drug’s sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $682 million but missed out on our estimate of $699 million.Sales from the neuroscience portfolio increased 15.0% on an operational basis to $1.70 billion, driven by higher sales of Botox Therapeutic and Vraylar. The new migraine drug Qulipta also contributed to sales growth. Neuroscience sales figures beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimate of $1.52 billion and $1.55 billion, respectively.While Botox Therapeutic sales rose 18.7% to $719 million, sales of Vraylar increased 31.3% to $561 million. Sales of AbbVie’s oral migraine drug Ubrelvy were $152 million, up 10.0% year over year.The recently launched Qulipta generated $66 million in product revenues compared to $52 million in fourth-quarter 2022.AbbVie’s oncology/hematology (including Imbruvica and Venclexta) sales declined 12.9% on an operational basis to $1.42 billion in the quarter, as growth of Venclexta sales, was more than offset by lower U.S. sales of Imbruvica. The oncology/hematology sales figure missed our model estimate of $1.45 billion.First-quarter net revenues from Imbruvica were $878 million, down 25.2% year over year. AbbVie markets the drug in partnership with Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ. The company shares international profits earned from Imbruvica with J&amp;J.U.S. sales of J&amp;J-partnered Imbruvica grossed $638 million, down 27.0% from the year-ago figure. Sales of the J&amp;J-partnered Imbruvica declined amid rising competition from novel oral treatments in the United States. AbbVie’s share of profit from the international sales of the J&amp;J-partnered drug declined 19.7% to $240 million.AbbVie’s leukemia drug Venclexta generated revenues of $538 million in the reported quarter, reflecting 17.5% year-over-year growth.AbbVie’s aesthetics portfolio sales were down 2.0% on an operational basis to $1.30 billion. Lower sales of Juvederm and other aesthetic drugs more than offset the growth in Botox Cosmetic product sales. Sales of Botox Cosmetic rose 5.8% on an operational basis to $659 million, while Juvéderm’s sales fell 7.4% on an operational basis to $355 million.Eye care portfolio sales declined 19.0% on an operational basis to $608 million. Sales of Restasis, a key drug in the portfolio, decreased 62.6% year over year to $92 million.Shares of AbbVie were down 6.0% in pre-market trading on Apr 27 likely due to a softer sales performance of Skyrizi. In the year so far, AbbVie’s shares have gained 0.1% compared with the industry’s 1.5% rise.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCost DiscussionAdjusted SG&amp;A expenses rose 4.6% to $2.98 billion, while adjusted R&amp;D expenses were $1.66 billion in the first quarter, up 12% year over year. The adjusted operating margin represented 45.0% of sales.Raises 2023 GuidanceAbbVie raised its earnings per share (EPS) guidance for 2023. The company now expects adjusted EPS in the range of $10.72-$11.12, a 10-cent rise in both the upper and lower limits of the previously provided EPS guidance of $10.62-$11.02.AbbVie Inc.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $449.2 million.Our TakeAccuray ended the third quarter of fiscal 2023 with better-than-expected results. The solid overall top-line and bottom-line performances were encouraging. Robust Product and Services revenues and geographical performances were impressive. Continued strong demand for Accuray’s Clear RT and Synchrony on Radixact and the CyberKnife S7 looks promising. During the reported quarter, the company set a new record for quarterly shipments and an increase in Accuray’s global installed base of customers were encouraging.Per Accuray’s management, its partnership with GE Healthcare continues to advance on multiple commercial fronts, raising our optimism.However, the decline in gross orders was disappointing. The gross margin contraction also does not bode well. The current global supply-chain shortages, forex woes and inflationary pressure are other challenges the company is navigating through, which is another concern.Zacks Rank and Key PicksAccuray currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation EW, Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

233,86b71dbb-9ee6-3404-a3d0-8d4f63b7893d,JNJ,2023-04-28,13 Value Stocks to Buy With High Dividend Yields,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/13-value-stocks-buy-high-152327724.html,1682609007,STORY,"['EPD', 'PXD', 'MO', 'MMP', 'BTI', 'DVN', 'PG', 'ET', 'KO', 'JNJ', 'ABR']","[In this article, we discuss 13 value stocks to buy with high dividend yields. You can skip our detailed analysis of value and dividend stocks and their performance in the past, and go directly to read 5 Value Stocks to Buy With High Dividend Yields. Value stocks trade at a price lower than their intrinsic or true value. These stocks are typically associated with companies that have solid fundamentals but are currently out of favor with investors, resulting in lower stock prices relative to their earnings, assets, and other metrics. Historically, growth stocks have beaten value stocks for the most part, however, value investment strategy has proven to be successful over the long term. Bank of America estimated that value investing has returned 1,344,600% since 1926, whereas growth stocks delivered a 626,000% return during the same period.The historical performance of value and growth stocks has varied over time, with periods of outperformance for each strategy. During years of high inflation, investors turn toward stocks with lower valuations and high dividend yields, which results in the solid performance of value stocks. Last year’s consistent interest rate hikes have given value equities their much-awaited comeback after underperforming growth securities for over a decade. According to a report by T. Rowe Price, the MSCI World Value Index outperformed its growth counterpart by over 20 percentage points last year. The report also mentioned that periods of high-interest rates create broader earnings growth in equity markets, resulting in a strong performance of value stocks.In one of our articles titled 11 Best Undervalued Dividend Stocks to Buy Now, we reported that value stocks surpassed growth equities by 18 percentage points in the first 10 months of 2022.Another report by Schroders revealed that periods of economic slowdown bode well for value stocks in the past. The asset management company gave a positive outlook on value investing and mentioned that value equities will outperform the broader market by 11.8% cumulatively over the next three years.Story continuesDividend stocks are also grabbing investors’ attention in addition to value stocks. Some of the best dividend stocks such as The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) are popular because these companies have rewarded shareholders with decades of dividend growth and have strong cash flows.13 Value Stocks to Buy With High Dividend YieldsImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur Methodology:For this list, we used the Finviz stock screener to identify dividend stocks with yields above 7%, as of April 26.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Our biggest dollar gainer within this period was Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had a material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies lead us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is mostly variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Value Stocks to Buy With High Dividend Yields.  Suggested articles:14 Best Income Stocks To Invest In10 Best Auto Parts Stocks to Buy Now10 Cheap AI Stocks to Buy in 2023Disclosure.

The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber The ModelWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$94.0mUS$383.0mUS$468.0mUS$531.1mUS$584.6mUS$629.4mUS$667.1mUS$699.2mUS$727.1mUS$752.0mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x1Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 13.49%Est @ 10.07%Est @ 7.67%Est @ 5.99%Est @ 4.81%Est @ 3.99%Est @ 3.41% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 14% US$82.5US$295US$316US$315US$304US$288US$267US$246US$224US$204(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$2.5bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 14%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$752m× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (14%– 2.1%) = US$6.5bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$6.5b÷ ( 1 + 14%)10= US$1.8bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$4.3b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$10.7, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 29% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 14%, which is based on a levered beta of 2.000. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Goodyear Tire &amp; RubberStrengthNo major strengths identified for GT.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Interest payments on debt are not well covered.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

Our definitions of the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.Also presented below is adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin by business type for the three months ended March 31, 2023.EBITDA and EBITDA MarginThe following table calculates EBITDA and EBITDA margin for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 (in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue):Three Months Ended March 31,20232022Net income attributable to Republic Services, Inc.$     383.910.7 %$     352.011.9 %Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests—(0.1)Provision for income taxes138.2120.3Other (income) expense, net(2.5)1.6Interest income(1.4)(0.5)Interest expense126.783.5Depreciation, amortization and depletion358.7310.4Accretion24.121.7EBITDA and EBITDA margin$  1,027.728.7 %$     888.929.9 %Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA MarginThe following table calculates adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 (in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue):Three Months Ended March 31,20232022EBITDA$  1,027.728.7 %$  888.929.9 %(Gain) loss from unconsolidated equity method investment(1.0)3.8Loss on extinguishment of debt and other related costs0.2—Restructuring charges5.56.0US Ecology acquisition integration and deal costs7.64.8Total adjustments12.314.6Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin$  1,040.029.0 %$  903.530.4 %Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin by Business TypeThe following table summarizes revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin by business type for the three months ended March 31, 2023 (in millions of dollars and adjusted EBITDA margin as a percentage of revenue):Three Months Ended March 31, 2023Recycling &amp; Solid WasteEnvironmental SolutionsTotalRevenue$       3,166.7$            414.4$   3,581.1Adjusted EBITDA(a)$          954.5$              85.5$   1,040.0Adjusted EBITDA Margin30.1 %20.6 %29.0 %(a)Certain corporate expenses, including selling, general and administrative expenses, and National Accounts revenue are allocated to the two business types.The amounts shown for Recycling &amp; Solid Waste represent the sum of our Group 1 and Group 2 reportable segments, and Environmental Solutions represents our Group 3 reportable segment.Adjusted Earnings Per ShareThe following table calculates adjusted pre-tax income, adjusted tax impact, adjusted net income - Republic, and adjusted diluted earnings per share for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022.Three Months Ended March 31, 2023Three Months Ended March 31, 2022DilutedDilutedNetEarningsNetEarningsPre-taxTaxIncome -perPre-taxTaxIncome -perIncomeImpact(2)RepublicShareIncomeImpact(2)RepublicShareAs reported$  522.1$     138.2$   383.9$     1.21$  472.2$     120.3$   352.0$     1.11Loss on extinguishment of debt and other related costs (1)0.2—0.2—————Restructuring charges5.51.54.00.016.01.64.40.02US Ecology acquisition integration and deal costs7.62.05.60.024.80.54.30.01Total adjustments13.33.59.80.0310.82.18.70.03As adjusted$  535.4$     141.7$   393.7$     1.24$  483.0$     122.4$   360.7$     1.14(1)The aggregate impact to adjusted diluted earnings per share totals to less than $0.01 for the three months ended March 31, 2023.(2)The income tax effect related to our adjustments includes both the current and deferred income tax impact and is individually calculated based on the statutory rates applicable to each adjustment.We believe that presenting EBITDA and EBITDA margin is useful to investors because they provide important information concerning our operating performance exclusive of certain non-cash and other costs. EBITDA and EBITDA margin demonstrate our ability to execute our financial strategy, which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service, investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services provided, maintaining our investment grade credit ratings and minimizing debt, paying cash dividends, repurchasing our common stock, and maintaining and improving our market position through business optimization. Although depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion are considered operating costs in accordance with U.S. GAAP, they represent the allocation of non-cash costs generally associated with long-lived assets acquired or constructed in prior years.We believe that presenting adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted pre-tax income, adjusted tax impact, adjusted net income - Republic, and adjusted diluted earnings per share provide an understanding of operational activities before the financial impact of certain items. We use these measures, and believe investors will find them helpful, in understanding the ongoing performance of our operations separate from items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period. We have incurred comparable charges, costs and recoveries in prior periods, and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods.(Gain) loss from unconsolidated equity method investments. The (gain) loss from unconsolidated equity method investments primarily relates to non-controlling equity interests in certain limited liability companies that qualified for investment tax credits under Section 48 of the Internal Revenue Code. We believe that adjusting EBITDA for our (gain) loss from unconsolidated equity method investments is useful to our investors as the relevant income tax benefit, primarily investment tax credits, is not included in the calculation of EBITDA.Loss on extinguishment of debt. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we incurred a loss on the early extinguishment of debt related to the early repayment of a portion of our term loan facility. We incurred non-cash charges related to the proportional share of unamortized deferred issuance costs.Restructuring charges. During the three months ended March 31, 2023 we incurred restructuring charges primarily related to the redesign of our customer billing and asset management software systems. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, we incurred restructuring charges primarily related to the redesign of our general ledger, budgeting, and procurement enterprise resource planning systems, which was completed with the systems being placed into production in the fourth quarter of 2022.US Ecology acquisition integration and deal costs. During the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, we incurred $7.6 million and $4.8 million, respectively, of acquisition integration and deal costs in connection with the acquisition of US Ecology, which included certain costs to close the acquisition and integrate the business, including stock compensation expense for unvested equity awards at closing as well as severance and change-in-control payments. The acquisition closed on May 2, 2022. We expect to be substantially complete with our integration activities by the end of 2023.Adjusted Free Cash FlowThe following table calculates our adjusted free cash flow, which is not a measure determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022:Three Months Ended March 31,20232022Cash provided by operating activities$                 687.7$                705.6Property and equipment received(206.8)(197.9)Proceeds from sales of property and equipment6.016.8Restructuring payments, net of tax3.74.3US Ecology acquisition integration and deal costs, net of tax4.92.1Adjusted free cash flow$                 495.5$                530.9We believe that presenting adjusted free cash flow provides useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by operating activities after certain expenditures or recoveries. It also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy and is a key metric we use to determine compensation. The presentation of adjusted free cash flow has material limitations. Adjusted free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary payments because it excludes certain payments that are required or to which we have committed, such as debt service requirements and dividend payments.Purchases of property and equipment as reflected on our consolidated statements of cash flows represent amounts paid during the period for such expenditures. A reconciliation of property and equipment expenditures reflected on our consolidated statements of cash flows to property and equipment received during the period follows for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022:Three Months Ended March 31,20232022Purchases of property and equipment per the unaudited consolidated statements of cash flows$               378.6$               334.1Adjustments for property and equipment received during the prior period but paid for in the following period, net(171.8)(136.2)Property and equipment received during the period$               206.8$               197.9The adjustments noted above do not affect our net change in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows.ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLEAs of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, accounts receivable were $1,686.4 million and $1,677.2 million, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $58.8 million and $51.9 million, respectively, resulting in days sales outstanding of 42.9, or 31.0 days net of deferred revenue, compared to 43.3, or 31.8 days net of deferred revenue, respectively. Excluding our acquisition of US Ecology, our days sales outstanding were 38.8, or 26.7 days net of deferred revenue, as of March 31, 2023.CASH DIVIDENDSIn January 2023, we paid a cash dividend of $156.4 million to shareholders of record as of January 3, 2023. As of March 31, 2023, we recorded a quarterly dividend payable of $156.5 million to shareholders of record at the close of business on April 3, 2023, which was paid on April 14, 2023.SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMDuring the three months ended March 31, 2023, there were no shares of common stock repurchased. As of March 31, 2023, the remaining authorized purchase capacity under our October 2020 repurchase program was $1.5 billion.INFORMATION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis press release contains certain forward-looking information about us that is intended to be covered by the safe harbor for ""forward-looking statements"" provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance in the past, and go directly to read 5 Best May Dividend Stocks To Buy. Dividend stocks have been a popular investment option for decades, providing investors with a steady stream of income from the dividends paid out by companies. Growth investment outweighed dividend stocks historically, however, the onset of the pandemic of 2020 has made investors risk-averse and led to a renewed interest in dividend companies. Over the years, dividends accounted for between 40% to 50% of total return in the US equity market, with an even larger proportion in international markets.Companies in the S&amp;P 500 paid out a record $561 billion in dividends in 2022, up from $511.2 billion in 2021. Another reason for this tremendous growth was resilient corporate earnings and solid cash flow on corporate balance sheets. The trend is expected to continue this year as well, however, with the recent developments surrounding the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) fallout and the state of the economy, analysts now expect a modest growth in dividend payments in 2023.In the first quarter of 2023, cash dividends within the S&amp;P 500 set a record payment, growing by 0.9% from the previous quarter and by 7.9% from the same period last year, as reported by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. For the 12-month period that ended March 2023, the S&amp;P 500 dividends were up 10.1% from the prior-year period. Some of the best dividend stocks that are gaining investors’ attention include Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX).Dividend stocks also offer a short-term profit opportunity to investors. For this reason, investors often use a dividend capture strategy, which involves buying a stock just before the company pays its dividend and then selling the stock shortly after the dividend is paid. To learn more about this investment strategy, readers can check out our previous article titled Dividend Capture Strategy Stocks To Buy.Story continues10 Best May Dividend Stocks To BuyPhoto by nick chong on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we selected dividend stocks that will trade ex-dividend in May 2023.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Our holding The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), which has a bank inside its operations, lost 37% of its value as investors feared it, too, would lose deposits (and earnings power). As Schwab began the year as a 7.0% weight in the portfolio, this hurt as much as the wipeout at First Republic. The declines in First Republic and Schwab together cost us a full five percentage points of our capital. Other financial holdings M&amp;T Bank, Credit Acceptance and JP Morgan also lost value during the quarter.Moving to Schwab, there are some similarities with First Republic, but I feel pretty strongly that we’re going to be fine holding on to the stock.I sometimes describe Schwab as the Costco of financial services. Others liken it to the auto insurer Progressive: it has the lowest operating costs in a huge, commoditized industry. Schwab passes on most of the savings from its low cost structure to clients, creating loyalty and trust, which in turn builds its brand. But Schwab has, over many years, reduced fees in so many areas that today it may be overly dependent on the net interest margin it earns on cash swept into its bank…” (Click here to read the full text)6.

In December 2022, the agency delayed its review. It was granted Priority Review status in August 2022.In the document, the agency pointed to a subgroup of patients without a BRCA mutation, saying that the data the companies have submitted may not be sufficient to expand use in that group.AstraZeneca and Merck have based their application on the Phase 3 PROpel trial.Lynparza achieved a radiographic progression-free survival of 24.8 months, compared to 16.6 months in the control group, and a 34% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death compared to the control.But the FDA said it ""is concerned that efficacy and safety have not been demonstrated outside of the small population of patients with tumor BRCA mutations and that adding olaparib to abiraterone may cause harm in patients who are definitively negative for tumor BRCA mutations.""The FDA said the PROpel study enrolled patients whether they had BRCA status or not. In subgroup analyses, those patients with a BRCA mutation saw the most effect, ""with modest benefit and possible harm for patients without tumor BRCA mutations.""For those without a BRCA mutation, there was a five-month improvement in median radiographic progression-free survival with a hazard ratio in overall survival of 0.92.In Q1 FY23, Lynparza generated sales of $651 million, up 50% Y/Y.Story continuesPrice Action: AZN shares are down 0.01% at $73.66 on the last check Thursday.Don't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

Earnings declined 35% year over year (30% excluding the impact of currency) due to charges related to acquisitions and collaboration deals. Earnings slightly missed our estimate of $1.41 per share.Including acquisition and divestiture-related costs, restructuring costs, income and losses from investments in equity securities, and certain other items, earnings per share were $1.11, down 30% (ex Fx) year over year.Revenues declined 9% year over year (5% on a constant currency basis) to $14.49 billion. Sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.84 billion and our estimate of $13.74 billion.Quarter in DetailThe Pharmaceutical segment generated revenues of $12.72 billion, down 10% (6% excluding Fx impact) year over year as higher sales of oncology drugs and vaccines were offset by lower sales of Merck’s COVID-19 drug, Lagevrio (molnupiravir) and diabetes medicines. Excluding Lagevrio, Pharmaceutical sales grew 14%.Keytruda, the largest product in Merck’s portfolio, generated sales of $5.8 billion in the quarter, up 20% (24% excluding Fx impact) year over year. Keytruda sales gained from continued strong momentum in metastatic indications, including in some types of NSCLC renal cell carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, TNBC and MSI-H cancers, and rapid uptake across recent earlier-stage launches. Keytruda sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.67 billion as well as our estimate is $5.72 billion.Alliance revenues from Lynparza and Lenvima also boosted oncology sales in the quarter. Merck has a deal with British pharma giant AstraZeneca AZN to co-develop and commercialize PARP inhibitor, Lynparza, and a similar one with Japan’s Eisai for its tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Lenvima.Alliance revenues from AstraZeneca-partnered Lynparza increased 8% (excluding Fx impact) year over year to $275 million in the quarter, driven by increased demand. Lenvima alliance revenues were $232 million, up 5% from the year-ago period.Story continuesIn the hospital specialty portfolio, neuromuscular blockade medicine, Bridion injection generated sales of $487 million in the quarter, up 27% year over year, driven by increased demand and market share.In vaccines, sales of HPV vaccines — Gardasil and Gardasil 9 — rose 43% year over year to $1.97 billion, driven by strong demand in ex-U.S. markets, particularly China. Gardasil sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.81 billion as well as our estimate of $1.88 billion.Proquad, M-M-R II and Varivax vaccines recorded combined sales of $528 million, up 14% year over year. Sales of the rotavirus vaccine, Rotateq rose 42% to $297 million. Pneumovax 23 (pneumococcal vaccine polyvalent) vaccine sales declined 40% to $96 million due to declining demand in the U.S. market as it shifts toward newer vaccines. Sales of Merck’s new pneumococcal 15-valent conjugate vaccine, Vaxneuvance, were $106 million compared with $138 million in the previous quarter.Januvia/Janumet (diabetes) franchise sales were down 25% year over year to $880 million. The drug sales were hurt by lower demand and pricing in the United States and generic competition in certain international markets. The drugs lost market exclusivity in China in July and the European Union in September last year.The company’s COVID-19 drug, Lagevrio (molnupiravir) generated sales of $392 million during the first quarter, down 87% year over year. Lower sales in Japan and Australia and no sales in the United States and the United Kingdom hurt Lagevrio sales. However, Lagevrio sales were better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $291 million as well as our estimate of $294 million.Merck’s Animal Health segment generated revenues of $1.49 billion, up 1% year over year (5% excluding Fx impact). Animal Health segment sales were better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.47 billion.Margin DiscussionAdjusted gross margin was 76.9%, up 620 basis points year over year, driven by the favorable impact of product mix and lower sales of Lagevrio, which is a low-margin product.Selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses were $2.5 billion in the reported quarter, up 9% year over year due to higher administrative costs and higher promotional spending. Research and development (R&amp;D) spending was $4.3 billion, reflecting an increase of 67% year over year due to increased charges related to the acquisition of Imago and a collaboration and licensing agreement with Kelun-Biotech.2023 Guidance UppedMerck slightly upped its earnings and sales outlook for 2023.Merck expects revenues to be in the range of $57.7-$58.9 billion in 2023 compared with $57.2 - $58.7 billion previously. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $58.5 billion.Lagevrio is expected to generate $1.0 billion in sales in 2023, a significant decline from $5.7 billion in 2022.Adjusted earnings per share are expected to be between $6.88 and $7.00 versus the prior expectation of $6.80 to $6.95. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $6.88 per share.The adjusted gross margin is expected to be approximately 77% (maintained).Adjusted operating costs are expected to be in the range of $23.3 to $24.1 billion versus the prior expectation of $23.1 to $24.1 billion. The adjusted tax rate is expected to be approximately 17% to 18% (maintained).The EPS guidance does not take into account charges related to Merck’s proposed acquisition of Prometheus Biosciences RXDX. In mid-April, Merck announced a definitive agreement to acquire Prometheus Biosciences for $200 per share in cash for a total equity value of approximately $10.8 billion.The deal will add Prometheus’ lead product candidate, PRA023, a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb). PRA023 is currently being developed in mid-stage studies for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases, including ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease and other autoimmune conditions. The Prometheus Biosciences acquisition is expected to close in the third quarter of 2023. The acquisition is expected to result in a one-time charge of approximately $10.3 billion or approximately $4.00 per share, which will reduce adjusted earnings.Our TakeMerck’s first-quarter results were better than expected as it beat estimates for earnings as well as sales.Strong sales of key products cancer drug, Keytruda and Gardasil vaccine drove the top line in the quarter. Merck also raised its full-year sales profit outlook, citing strong global underlying demand for its key products. Shares of Merck were up 1.4% in pre-market trading.The stock has rallied 34.4% in the past year compared with the industry’s increase of 12.1%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Merck’s drugs like Keytruda and Gardasil vaccine have been driving sales.

Earnings from big players like Merck and AbbVie setting the tone for an industry with a mixed quarterly outlook.Here with a read on the headwinds facing drugmakers and what this means for investors watching the space is Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani. Anj, what have we seen so far?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Well, as we know from the last week with J&amp;J and others, we're seeing a little bit of a mixed outlook for this sector. Let's take a look first at AbbVie, which we saw facing a little bit of pressure from generic competition-- not as much as they expected. But for Humira, they did expect that to come in in the first quarter as we saw, you know, that rush to include biosimilars on formularies. So we're seeing how that's playing out. Not too much of a hit just yet. Still the stock is down.Meanwhile, Merck loses big on the decline of the COVID treatment molnupiravir, down by I think more than 80% was the number, so that's huge. But, of course, it's got a diverse portfolio, so they were able to buck up with Keytruda, their blockbuster, and Gardasil.Still some headwinds there for Keytruda. As we know, it's coming into potentially the falling-- the fall off of the patent. So that's sort of where the focus is.If you look at sort of the upside for these companies, it really is just looking at the broader outlook for the portfolio. We've seen some pulling back even on pipelines. Taking a look at Biogen and Novartis this week reporting a decline in their pipelines. Biogen cutting a little bit, and Novartis cutting 10% of its portfolio. And so you can see sort of this right sizing, focusing on blockbusters as well.Eli Lilly, meanwhile, did get some positive results out of its obese diabetics-- sorry, for Mounjaro. There would be reduction in weight loss for obese diabetics by 16%, so that's pretty good. Definitely some positives there.Story continuesSo all told, as you can see, downside is definitely generics pressure, either immediate or upcoming, as well as the loss of the COVID drugs or, you know, portfolio for products for whoever did have it. And then on the upside, you see more long-term growth, long-term outlook, and upgrading their 2023 outlook as well.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, it's interesting to see all of this sort of resetting, right, re-table-setting following as we get out of the pandemic. One of the ways, of course, a lot of them have been building up pipelines is through making acquisitions.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Yes.JULIE HYMAN: And presumably there will be more of those. Do we see that sort of, like, bearing fruit, and is this going to be another big deal year for these companies?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: So far yes. So far, it looks like-- of course, we've already seen some of the big ones like Pfizer, right, but we definitely know that they are looking. Merck has been struggling to acquire more assets. That's been one of the concerns from investors, and we've seen those analyst notes pointing to that.But we do know that it's gearing up to be a pretty big year. There is a shift in what may be, you know, a nice target for these companies. Previously we know cancer has been huge, but it seems like that's not getting as much excitement this year. So it's going to be interesting to see what disease state and what sector really gets all that attention this year.BRAD SMITH: Yahoo Finance--JULIE HYMAN: Good if cancer would get--ANJALEE KHEMLANI: I know.JULIE HYMAN: --some attention.BRAD SMITH: Well, yeah. Absolutely.JULIE HYMAN: Anyway.BRAD SMITH: Yahoo Finance's own Anjalee Khemlani, thanks so much.]"
247,26f9fa0b-8ebd-3dfe-b2a8-58e3d34ef444,MRK,2023-04-28,"Drugmakers scout for deals, ramp up research spending",Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/drugmakers-post-healthy-results-growth-133306015.html,1682602386,STORY,"['AZN.L', 'MRK', 'LLY', 'AZN', 'ABBV']","[By Manas Mishra and Patrick Wingrove(Reuters) - Drugmakers including Merck &amp; Co, AstraZeneca Plc and AbbVie Inc said on Thursday they are open to acquisitions and reported a ramp up in research and development spending as the industry's larger players look for new sources of future revenue.Several top drugs such as AbbVie flagship Humira have begun to face competition from new rivals or are expected to lose patent protections in the next few years, and deals could be a quick fix to address the loss of revenue from older therapies.Merck recently announced a $10.8 billion deal to buy Prometheus Biosciences Inc.Chief Executive Robert Davis said that deal does not change the company's business development strategy.""We're focused on building the pipeline, both near and long term, and we do deals across the full spectrum,"" he said.Sales of Merck's cancer immunotherapy Keytruda will start losing patent protections in 2028. Meanwhile, it has become the world's top selling prescription drug with first-quarter sales of $5.8 billion, exceeding even analysts' lofty estimates.Guggenheim analyst Seamus Fernandez said pharmaceutical patent expirations will accelerate from 2026 to 2032 and that most will face competition from biosimilars that compete with complex biologic drugs.A drop in valuation of smaller U.S. biotech companies from pandemic highs has made deals more attractive, and the collapse of top venture debt provider Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) is expected to worsen a funding drought for those companies.""It's certainly more difficult to raise money for a biotech company. So it probably makes them a bit more willing to engage with players like us,"" said an AbbVie executive during a call to discuss first-quarter results.AbbVie on Thursday reported sales that missed estimates for most treatments, including its blockbuster arthritis drug Humira, and its shares closed down 8%.Humira's U.S. sales fell 26.1% in the quarter to $2.95 billion as it faced its first biosimilar competition from Amgen's Amjevita, and AbbVie forecast a steeper erosion in Humira's market share in the second quarter.Story continuesAmgen, which launched Amjevita in January, slightly increased its forecast for full-year 2023 revenue to $26.2 billion to $27.3 billion, from the previous outlook of $26 billion to $27.2 billion.That excludes the impact of Amgen's pending $27.8 billion acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics Plc, which the company still expects to complete in the first half of this year.Like Merck, AstraZeneca continues to reap the rewards of patent-protected cancer therapies for now.AstraZeneca beat first-quarter estimates as sales of Imfinzi and strong demand in China helped soften the hit from falling sales of COVID-19 drugs.The Britain-based drugmaker re-emphasized its focus in China, aiming to seize the opportunity to treat patients as the country bounces back from a protracted period of severe COVID restrictions.In the last few months, AstraZeneca signed three licensing deals with Chinese companies, said CEO Pascal Soriot, adding that more, possibly larger moves are being contemplated.""We definitely could make acquisitions. There is no limitation to this,"" Soriot said.R&amp;D SPENDING RAMPS UPMost drugmakers reporting on Thursday beat Wall Street estimates for first-quarter earnings, while Eli Lilly and Co missed mainly due to higher costs.""You gotta spend money, to make money!,"" BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said of Lilly's results.Research and development (R&amp;D) costs at other drugmakers also rose in the quarter.Merck reported a 66% jump in R&amp;D costs, attributing about $1.2 billion to a charge from its acquisition of Imago. AstraZeneca's R&amp;D spending rose 22% in the quarter.Amgen said its R&amp;D costs rose 12% in the first quarter, while Gilead Science Inc reported a 25% research spending jump to $1.4 billion, driven partly by higher expenses in late-stage clinical studies.Gilead said it also expected full-year R&amp;D expenses to rise to a low-double-digit percentage compared to 2022.""We believe that there's a more appropriate level of investment for a company with a broad late-stage clinical portfolio that is targeting attractive opportunities and sustainable revenue growth,"" said Chief Financial Officer Andrew Dickinson.(Graphic: Drugmakers ramp up R&amp;D spending - https://www.reuters.com/graphics/HEALTH-PHARMACEUTICALS/znpnbnanwpl/chart_eikon.jpg)Share movements were mixed on Thursday.Eli Lilly shares closed 3.7% higher after it raised its annual revenue and profit forecasts on demand for its closely watched diabetes drug Mounjaro, which is being used off-label as an obesity treatment.Merck's shares had been down earlier but closed up $1.5%, while shares of Bristol Myers Squibb fell 0.6% after it missed first-quarter sales estimates.Shares of both Amgen and Gilead were down more that 2% in after hours trading.(Reporting by Bhanvi Satija, Leroy Leo, Raghav Mahobe in Bengaluru, Natalie Grover in London, Michael Erman and Patrick Wingrove in New York; Writing by Manas Mishra; Editing by Caroline Humer and Bill Berkrot)]"

MoretThanks, Aijana, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Let's turn to our second quarter results on Slide 3. We had an outstanding quarter of strong growth in both sales and earnings. Our double-digit sales and margin growth continue to reflect Rockwell's strong execution and focus on business resiliency as well as overall improvement in electronic component availability. The demand for our differentiated offerings continue to be strong even in this uncertain economic environment. Through the first half of this fiscal year, our total orders were $4.8 billion, spread evenly between the 2 quarters once we adjust for the estimated price-related pull forward in our fiscal Q1. As expected, our order cancellation rates remain in the low single digits through April.Total sales grew over 25% versus prior year. Organic sales were up over 27% year-over-year and were above our expectations. Currency translation reduced sales by about 3% and acquisitions contributed over 1 point of growth this quarter. As in the prior quarters, the split of sales by business segment, region and industry, was largely driven by access to electronic components and the composition of our backlog.In the Intelligent Devices business segment, organic sales grew 27% versus prior year with broad-based growth across all businesses. We continue to see wider adoption of our Independent Cart Technology in new applications across semiconductor, food and beverage and life sciences. One example of a new application is wafer transport in semiconductor fabs. We continue to see increasing demand for this offering, including an important win with a large U.S. company this quarter. This customer is investing in modernizing and expanding its material handling systems and our Independent Cart Technology helps increase wafer output and more efficiently utilizes existing fab space leading to increased capacity and significant savings.Software and Control organic sales increased over 40%. Strong growth versus prior year was led by logic, where we continue to see the benefits of our resiliency investments and an overall improvement in supply chain.Lifecycle Services organic sales were up 12% year-over-year. Book-to-bill in this segment was 1.27, led by strong order intake in our Sensia business. Information Solutions and Connected Services sales grew about 10% versus prior year. We had another quarter of competitive multiyear wins across our software and cybersecurity services portfolio.Within Information Solutions, I am pleased with the increasing breadth of our new Plex customers as we continue to expand our SaaS, Smart Manufacturing platform to new industries and geographies.One of our Plex wins this quarter was with AB-InBev, the world's largest brewing company and its start-up business EverGrain, focused on upcycling grain by product into sustainable supply of nutritious food ingredients. Our modular and cloud-native Plex software is helping EverGrain quickly deploy mission-critical quality management capabilities today while providing the functionality for the business to scale in the future.In Connected Services, we saw another quarter of customer demand for our recurring cybersecurity and infrastructure as a service offerings as customers across many industries are continuing to invest in safety and security of their operations. One of these wins was with Darling Ingredients, a food processing company focused on reducing food waste by collecting and repurposing animal-based products.Our annual recurring revenue grew 15% year-over-year in Q2. Segment margin of 21.3% was up over 560 basis points year-over-year and was better than expected. Adjusted EPS grew over 81% year-over-year. We also completed the acquisition of Knowledge Lens this quarter. which adds significant scale to our Kalypso digital services business.Let's now turn to Slide 4 to review key highlights of our Q2 end market performance. Consistent with my earlier comments on the gradually improving supply chain environment, all 3 industry segments grew strong double digits versus prior year. Our discrete sales were up about 20% in the quarter. Within discrete, Automotive sales grew over 40% versus prior year. We saw a number of strategic wins in EV and battery this quarter both in the U.S. and China, where a combination of our core automation and strong partner ecosystem helped edge out our biggest competitors. While some customers are optimizing operating costs in the near term, they still continue to invest in building out new capacity to meet their production goals.Semiconductor sales were up mid-teens year-over-year. I already mentioned 1 semiconductor win. Another example of how Rockwell is expanding our existing semi footprint now with wafer transport applications is our multiyear project win with analog devices.Our Independent Cart Technology was chosen to automate [ADi's] material handling applications at several of their global fabs. By implementing our technology, ADi will improve operator productivity by at least 20% by moving away from manually delivering lots across the fab. In E-commerce and Warehouse Automation, our Q2 sales were down mid-single digits versus prior year. While we continue to see a pause in greenfield announcements, e-commerce players, traditional retailers and many consumer packaged goods companies continue to invest in modernizing their warehouses.Turning to our hybrid industries. Sales in this segment increased 35% year-over-year, led by strong growth in food and beverage. Food and beverage sales were up almost 40% versus prior year. We also saw a number of large orders this quarter with customers in this vertical continuing to invest in making their brownfield facilities more efficient and resilient. Demand in our dairy and agriculture processing business remains especially strong.Life Sciences sales grew 20% year-over-year. One of the important wins this quarter was with a leading European health care company, where our Kalypso digital services used our Emulate3D simulation software to model and test multiple plant layouts to eliminate potential bottlenecks and increase worker safety. Tire was up over 50% in the quarter.Moving to process. This segment was up over 25% versus prior year, once again led by growth in oil and gas and metals. Within process, we had an important sustainability win. Through Occidental Petroleum's 1.5 subsidiary, Rockwell is providing control systems for direct air capture units that help remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. We are proud to be a part of Oxy's low-carbon strategy to deliver large-scale carbon management solutions that accelerate net zero economy.Turning now to Slide 5 and our Q2 organic regional sales. Similar to prior quarters, our growth by region reflects the electronic component availability and what's in our backlog rather than the underlying customer demand. North America organic sales grew 23% year-over-year. Latin America increased 16%, and EMEA sales grew 42% and Asia Pacific was up 32%.Let's now move to Slide 6, fiscal 2023 outlook. We have previously said that the fiscal '23 sales performance is primarily based on our ability to ship backlog. Given our performance in the first half, improving chip supply and the benefits of our resiliency actions, we are increasing our sales and earnings outlook for fiscal '23. Our fiscal '23 guidance projects total reported sales growth of 14.5%. We expect organic sales growth of 15% at the midpoint. We expect acquisitions to contribute over 1 point of growth and currency to be a headwind of 1.5 points. Nick will touch more on this later.Organic ARR is expected to grow 15%. Segment margin is expected to increase by over [160] basis points year-over-year. Adjusted EPS is expected to grow 25% versus prior year, and we continue to target 95% free cash flow conversion.Before I turn it over to Nick, let me share some of our thoughts on the setup for fiscal year '24. With more than half of this fiscal year behind us and through our continued discussions with end customers, we believe we have better visibility into our full year orders and backlog levels. We expect our fiscal '23 orders to be about $9 billion, which implies a slight moderation of orders in the second half of this year. This is consistent with our expectations of improving component availability and the subsequent reduction in customer lead times.With our current orders outlook, we anticipate exiting the year with backlog levels of around $5 billion, positioning us well for fiscal year '24. Also, as the largest pure play, we have an impressive record of earnings growth, and we expect that to continue given our unique market focus and differentiation. Let me turn it over to Nick to provide more detail on our Q2 performance and financial outlook for fiscal '23. Nick?Nicholas C. GangestadThank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 8, second quarter key financial information. Second quarter reported sales were up 25.8% over last year. Q2 organic sales were up 27.3%, and acquisitions contributed 130 basis points to total growth.Currency translation decreased sales by 2.8% about 6 points of our organic growth came from price. Segment operating margin expanded to 21.3% and was higher than our expectations. The majority of this outperformance was driven by the higher revenue. The 560 basis point year-over-year increase in margin was driven by higher sales volume and positive price costs, partially offset by higher incentive compensation and higher investment spend.Corporate and other expense was $29 million, in line with our expectations. Adjusted EPS of $3.01 was ahead of our expectations and grew 81% versus prior year. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide.The adjusted effective tax rate for the second quarter was 17.4%. Free cash flow of $156 million was $110 million higher compared to last year, driven by higher pretax income, partially offset by higher working capital. The increase in working capital was primarily driven by higher accounts receivable given our Q2 sales outperformance.We improved our days on hand in inventory by 7 days in Q2, and we expect reductions in inventory days to continue for the balance of the year. One additional item not shown on the slide, we repurchased approximately 140,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $38 million. On March 31, $1.1 billion remained available under our repurchase authorization.Slide 9 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our 3 operating segments. Organic sales grew double digits year-over-year in each of our operating segments. Turning to margins. Intelligent Devices margin increased by 560 basis points year-over-year due to positive price cost and higher sales volume, partially offset by higher investment spend and incentive compensation.Segment margin for Software and Control increased 900 basis points compared to last year on higher sales volume and positive price costs partially offset by higher investment spend and incentive compensation.Lifecycle Services margin decreased by 180 basis points year-over-year as the benefit of higher sales was more than offset by higher incentive compensation and onetime items to expand future profitability. We expect Lifecycle Services margin to expand sequentially and exceed 10% in Q4.The next Slide, 10, provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q2 fiscal '22 to Q2 fiscal '23. Core performance was up $1.95 on a 27.3% organic sales increase. The impact of currency was a $0.15 reduction in EPS. The year-over-year headwind reflects a stronger dollar versus Q2 of last year. Incentive compensation was a $0.40 headwind. This year-over-year increase reflects our lower bonus in Q2 of last year and our higher growth and earnings expectations for this fiscal year.Higher interest expense was a $0.05 impact. Our adjusted -- our higher adjusted effective tax rate was a $0.05 headwind and our reduction in outstanding shares added about $0.05.Let's move on to Slide 11, guidance for fiscal '23. We are increasing our reported sales guidance to approximately $8.9 billion in fiscal '23 or 14.5% growth at the midpoint. We expect organic sales growth to be in a range of 13% to 17% or 15% at the midpoint. We expect volume to add 10 points of growth and price to add 5 points of growth. This guidance takes into account our performance through the first half of the fiscal year and is based on our current view of ongoing supply chain improvement.In terms of the second half, we expect mid-teens organic growth in Q3 and high single-digit growth in Q4. This calendarization includes our view of chip availability in each of the next 2 quarters and our Q3 transition from one third-party logistics provider to another at 1 of our distribution centers. We now expect a full year currency headwind of 150 basis points, which is 50 basis points better than our previous guidance. This updated outlook primarily reflects the strengthening of the Euro against the U.S. dollar.We expect full year segment operating margin to be about 21.5%, up from our prior guidance of about 21%, driven by higher volume and higher benefit from price costs for the full year. We now expect an over 200 basis point improvement to margin year-over-year from positive price cost. This represents a 100 basis point increase versus our prior guidance, split evenly between price and cost. Our updated guidance now assumes full year core earnings conversion of close to 40%. We now expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 17.5%, down from our prior forecast of 18% due to discrete items that were realized in Q2.We are increasing our adjusted EPS guidance to $11.50 to $12.20. At the midpoint of the range, this represents 25% adjusted EPS growth, up from prior guidance of approximately 17% growth at the midpoint.We expect full year fiscal '23 free cash flow conversion of about 95% of adjusted income. A few additional comments on fiscal '23 guidance. Corporate and other expense is still expected to be around $120 million. Net interest expense for fiscal '23 is still expected to be around $130 million. And we're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 115.6 million shares.Turning to Slide 12. Versus our prior guidance, we are increasing the midpoint for EPS by $0.75. Our guidance reflects an increase in our core of $1.05 driven by higher organic sales and our improved outlook in price/cost. We also deployed additional investments in sales and new product development as well as digital infrastructure that will generate future revenue growth and profitability. Currency is adding $0.05. Given the stronger outlook, our incentive compensation is increased by $0.40. And finally, our 50 basis point drop in our adjusted effective tax rate will add $0.05.With that, I will turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&amp;A. Blake?Blake D. MoretThanks, Nick. We are still operating in a dynamic environment and are laser-focused on execution through the rest of this fiscal year. With that said, we are continuing to accelerate new product development and investments in cloud-native technologies.Revenue from our new offerings, both organic and inorganic is becoming a more meaningful contributor to growth and share gains. We are the largest pure-play automation company with market-leading solutions across discrete, hybrid and process industries and we are adding scale to our differentiated offerings through strong partnerships and strategic acquisitions.Our recent acquisition of Knowledge Lens is adding 600 resources with cutting-edge data science, AI and cloud solutions to our existing digital services business. This expanded team is already working with our key customers on their next-generation plans. I want to welcome all Knowledge Lens' employees to Rockwell.Our close relationships with end customers, our best-in-class ecosystem and our talent give us confidence in the continued momentum for growth and profitability this year and beyond. Aijana will now begin the Q&amp;A session.Question and Answer SessionAijana ZellnerThanks, Blake. (Operator Instructions) Thank you.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup.Andrew Alec KaplowitzBlake, so just focusing on your comments in terms of the setup for '24. I know there will be some investors who will think about the $9 billion of orders and say, look at [Rockwell] order deceleration in the second half. But how do you think about the cycle in the context of your $9 billion-plus solution, as we call it, that you're coming close to hitting this year and the $5 billion of backlog you end the year with. I know you suggested you're set up '24 earnings growth, but can you talk about how you're thinking about the durability of the automation cycle based on the conversations you're having? And do you have the capacity to grow beyond that $9 billion?Blake D. MoretSure. Well, let me take that first, Andy. We're continuing to add capacity. So at the same time that chip supply is improving. We're continuing to make sure that our labor and our facilities, our redundancy across our integrated supply chain operations is ready to handle continued growth. So let me start there.Now in terms of the demand, this is playing out like we thought it would. We have said for some time now that we did expect orders and shipments to converge as lead times improve. And so that's exactly what you're seeing, but the orders are continuing at a strong pace. And to look at that, let's take kind of a vertical by vertical view, we've talked about the historic generational spending levels in certain of the verticals that are important to us, things like electric vehicle and battery and semiconductor. We're seeing additional expenditures in energy, both as the fossil fuel providers decarbonize and as renewables become a bigger part of our business as well. But we're also seeing across all verticals an increased focus on automation, and that's due to large durable trends, things like scarcity of trained workforce and so the need to complement people with the technologies and the software and the services that we provide. So as I look across that while we continue to pay close attention to macroeconomic conditions, we think the setup for multiyear growth in automation and information is there.Andrew Alec KaplowitzVery helpful, Blake. And then maybe Blake or Nick, can you give us a little more color on your margins in the segments. If I look at Software and Control, it seems like when supply chain headwinds are not impacting that business, you can do sort of low to mid-30s and Lifecycle, obviously, still kind of lagging behind a little bit. So do you get Lifecycle up now starting in the second half of the year? And is that a fair assessment of Software and Control when it's sort of firing on all cylinders, it's an above 30% margin business.Nicholas C. GangestadYes, Andy, let me take that. As far as Software and Control with what we're seeing in that business and the mix of what we're selling and the strength in the overall market there, we do see 30 -- over 30% as a sustainable margin for that business. In terms of Lifecycle Services, we see that -- that's going to be sequentially going up. And we had talked earlier about getting this to double digits. We see that happening in the fourth quarter. And we think that's a good trajectory we're going to expect to see happen beyond '23 as well. So that's where we're seeing margins in those 2 segments.OperatorOur next question comes from Joshua Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley.Joshua Charles PokrzywinskiSo Blake, just on some of the order commentary, I want to square the circle here a little bit. Talking about, I guess, you kind of comp the comp sequentially. You had the pull forward that probably happened around the price increase. As you said, lead times are coming down a little bit. So presumably, customers sort of altering plans accordingly, but you still have, call it, flattish sequential order. So something seem to have gotten better. It seems like it's the same markets that get mentioned over and over again, like EV and battery and Life Sciences and a few others that come in there. But did anything, I guess, build momentum quarter-over-quarter and anything in terms of March or April exit rates that we should be aware of?Blake D. MoretYes, a couple of things. Josh, it was fairly broad, but in addition to the usual suspects, the things that we've been talking about for a while now, I'd say oil and gas orders were quite good. We had some major competitive wins in our Sensia business that built some great backlog there. And I would also say within the orders -- North American orders were relatively stronger than Europe and Asia, and we expect that to continue for the rest of the year.Joshua Charles PokrzywinskiGot it. That's helpful. And then I guess there's the obligatory question for Nick on investment spending since I think that gets pulled around a little bit, especially when things are a little better than expected. Nick, was there any kind of reallocation of investment spending to get more in this quarter? And how should we think about the rest of the year?Nicholas C. GangestadYes. The investment spend for this particular for second quarter, it came up a few million dollars more than what we had in our initial plan for Q2. We are upping our investment spend in the third and fourth quarter. We started the year with, what I would call, a pretty conservative view of what we were going to do on spend, and we were holding some things in our back pocket that if things improve, we would be ready to invest in, and we are releasing that in the second half of the year. All in, that we see total investment spend up for the full year versus what we had previously estimated up by roughly $50 million. It's up year over year $180 million. I previously in the last guidance said it would be up $130 million, it's now up $180 million.OperatorOur next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America.Andrew Burris ObinJust we are getting questions on lead times. So how should I think about this $5 billion number? Is that just a nice round comp to where you were versus fiscal -- the end of fiscal '22 where you sort of showed you were slightly above $5 billion, right, and then sort of $9 billion matches, $9 billion is just very simple math. Or is there a sort of dynamic update to this number throughout the year? Is it just basically a placeholder to help us think about the big framework? Or is that a number sort of somebody manages to an update inside the company every quarter?Blake D. MoretYes, Andrew, you should think about that as a slight reduction of the current backlog, which sits at about $5.6 billion, but still held up by continuing strong order rates. So it's not intended to be precise, but on the other hand, it does reflect the trends that we're seeing and that is that as lead times improve, we're able to clear past due backlog, but the overall number stays quite high due to the continuing strength of orders.Andrew Burris ObinGot you. And just a question on Plex because you guys had a great demo at Hanover show. Can you just a, 15% ARR is pretty impressive. But can we just talk about Plex is doing? And how does Rockwell sort of manage historical focus on large enterprise and try to sort of deal with the product and F&amp;B end market, just evolution of Plex what the experience has been, as I said, because clearly, a big focus at Hanover show.Blake D. MoretSure. Well, well, Plex continues to be a really exciting addition to our offering, and it's playing out like we hoped it would when we made that acquisition. Plex is smart manufacturing platform to be sure, has MES capability, but it also has quality management, supply chain and even ERP functionality for small- and medium-sized businesses. When we bought Plex, they had a great track record in certain verticals like tier automotives, but we knew that with our existing market access, we could expand that into food and beverage and EV and mining. And we also knew that we had the opportunity to geographically diversify their customer base and we're doing just that with wins in Asia and with putting Plex on to Azure in Europe where we've already seen some nice wins there. So it's that synergy that's playing out, and there is lots of room to run with that. So it's working well. I've mentioned before, one of the things that we've done is to take the seasoned veterans of selling cloud-native SaaS software and given them enterprise-wide roles within Rockwell. So software sales leadership, our Chief Marketing Officer and a number of other functions are coming from Plex. So it's not just the technology and the business, it's also the expertise that we're making sure that we don't [vary] in the organization.Andrew Burris ObinAnd growth rates sort of commensurate was 15%. Is it in line with 15% for the rest of the business, better or worse, if you could just sort of benchmark that if you're...Blake D. MoretSure. Plex and [Fix] are very supportive to the overall growth of our software business.OperatorOur next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays.Julian C.H. MitchellMaybe just wanted to try and drill into that book-to-bill element a little bit more for the back half being well below 1. It doesn't sound like you're perturbed by that. But just trying to understand, if we look at it in a little bit more detail, anything you'd call out around sort of hybrid versus process versus discrete markets, maybe where you see that book-to-bill or year-on-year orders pressure being most severe. And just maybe a question sort of more broadly on that for Blake. You've had this component flush driving this huge revenue surge right now. Is there sort of a view on the world or the demand environment post that flush changed at all in recent months?Blake D. MoretYes. So Julian, let me start. I wouldn't characterize the reduction in backlog is pressured. It's playing out in a way that we would hope it is in that we're clearing past due backlog and improving customer service levels and adding additional orders in the business. So you know historically that Rockwell has been fortunate to be able to ship out products pretty much in the same quarter that we get the order. So this is unusual to have product backlog, and we intend to continue to reduce the lead times and products just as much as possible. At the same time, a 1.27 book-to-bill in our Lifecycle Services business gives us good confidence about continuing demand for longer cycle projects there. So I feel good about the way that this is working. We obviously are focused on execution as well as creating additional demand going forward, but we feel this is a very healthy environment.To your second question about, has anything changed in terms of the component world, being able to get chips. I mean we're always going to have a larger effort than we did pre supply chain constraints on making sure that our designs are resilient, both in terms of reevaluating existing products as well as new products and to make sure that they will go forward unless we have new levels of resiliency in component supply and robust designs to be able to reduce dependencies on any one vendor. So that's here to stay. We do believe, as Nick talked about, working capital with some of the inventory increases to go down, and that supports the good cash flow for the year. So certain of those things aren't going to change all the way back to, let's say, prepandemic, but we do expect a return to more normal levels in working capital and so on as we go forward as the chip constraints continue to resolve themselves.Julian C.H. MitchellThat's helpful, Blake. And when you sort of look at the 2 components of customer demand being strong and a good pipeline of projects coming up, plus at the same time, a sort of accelerated backlog conversion into revenue because of supply chain, do you think we could be in for quite a prolonged period of having that book-to-bill below 1? Or you're sort of thinking, no, we get some adjustments for a couple of quarters and then it moves back into [sync] of sort of one-to-one like Rockwell's classic business model.Blake D. MoretYes. Beyond kind of unusual levels of disclosure about the setup for '24 we've already given. I'm not going to guess further about that, but we do believe that the demand for automation in the specific verticals that I've talked about and as well as a general setup is something that's a positive read going forward. And our intention is to reduce product level lead times closer and closer to what they were before these constraints, but with an incoming order rate far above what they were prepandemic.OperatorOur next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.Charles Stephen TusaCongrats on the execution on this backlog. I missed a part of the call. But did you guys talk about the sequential change in that -- in the backlog from 4Q -- or sorry, 1Q to 2Q?Nicholas C. GangestadSteve, what we talked about is that the backlog at the middle of the year for us now stands at $5.6 billion. That's versus $5.2 million that it was at the beginning of the year. so up $400 million for the first 6 months of the year.Charles Stephen TusaOkay. That's great. And then just on the margins at S&amp;C, how much of that is like did you break down at all how much of that was the products-related price/cost spread? Maybe just a little bit more color on the year-over-year margin drivers? How much came from the products in that business and how much came from the software there?Nicholas C. GangestadI haven't provided the product versus the software mix. But in terms of the things that are causing the margin expansion. The biggest factor by far is the volume growth that we're experiencing and the leverage we're getting on that.The second biggest thing that is improving that margin is the favorable price/cost versus where we were in second quarter last year. And then offsetting that, to some extent, to bring it down to a 900 basis point year-on-year increase. We have increased investment spend year-over-year in software and control, and we also are facing noticeably higher incentive compensation. Those are the 2 negative things on the margin in the year-over-year Q2 for Software and Control.Charles Stephen TusaAnd then where do you expect that margin to end? Where do you expect that margin to finish the year just for the annual S&amp;C margin?Nicholas C. GangestadYes. We think it will be over 30%. It's -- and that's up from what I have said in the past that we see that margin being able to sustain into the second half of the year. At levels fairly similar to what we're seeing in our second quarter. So full year, we're going to be above 30% could be a few percentage points above 30%.OperatorOur next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research.Nigel Edward CoeSo I too missed some of the call, so I apologize if we're going to be sort of like -- I will be asking the questions you've been asked about 3 times. But just wondering about the backlog kind of conversion means supply chains, where are we versus normal in terms of lead times? And converting this backlog, is it more constraint of just the lead times? Is it labor? Is it customer acceptance, project timing? what could cause the backlog to convert even faster in the second half of the year?Blake D. MoretYes. Nigel, this is a good development in that as the chip supply is easing that's really the primary limiting factor as we're clearing older backlog there. As we've said, we've got about $5.6 billion worth of backlog, and we're expecting that to go down to around $5 billion by the end of the year, but it's held up by continuing good order intake there. And also the contribution from Lifecycle Services with its strong book-to-bill. So it's primarily the chip supply. We feel good about our ability to continue to add labor in our facilities around the world. We've been adding for some time now, additional equipment. But as you know, we're not really a very capital-intensive operation. So it's not like we're having to add a lot of heavy equipment because we're primarily an intellectual capital company. And so the equipment that we need has relatively shorter lead times than if we were in heavier manufacturing type operations.Nigel Edward CoeAnd then just another stab at the backlog. Are we seeing the mix of the backlog shifting to some of the larger projects, particularly with the systems, EV plants, et cetera. I mean, so are we seeing some of those larger systems orders coming through in the backlog? And then just kind of another part of that would be -- you point to $9 billion of orders, so obviously $4.8 billion in the first half, $4.2 billion in the second half. What's -- I mean, 4.2% is still a very healthy level, no question about it, but -- what's causing that drop down? Is it project timing? Is it lead times for customers -- channels are just not placing kind of the same rate of orders. What kind of visibility do you have to that second half deceleration in orders? Again, very healthy level but you are pointing to declining orders.Blake D. MoretYes. So first of all, in terms of the composition of the backlog, I don't think we're seeing any fundamental change in the type of orders. Now obviously, as we move through the backlog has a richer pricing as we work through the year. So that's a good read. But in terms of the number of big EV projects or semiconductor, facilities management systems or Independent Cart or just continuing MRO, I don't think you're going to see a big change because a lot of these investment cycles in those areas are multiyear. We're in it for the long haul with some of these positive areas. Now in terms of where you might see a little bit of the contribution from the moderation in orders, probably the most specific area is as lead times improve, as they are across a lot of our product lines, you'll see machine builders not having to provide orders of the same size to have as many months of coverage of their backlog.So as they're concerned about their cash flow and they can look at shorter lead times, then they can reduce the size of their orders because they don't need as many months coverage for the machines that they've already booked. So I think that's probably the most specific contribution to some of the orders moderation.OperatorOur next question comes from Rob Mason from Baird.Robert W. MasonI called out Sensia several times in and around oil and gas. So it sounds like things are positioned to accelerate further there. But any thoughts just on -- it still looks like maybe we're pulling through an operating loss just based on the minority interest, how profitability might shift as we go forward over the next 6, 12 months at Sensia.Blake D. MoretYes. You said it. I mean, we're seeing some good growth there. We had a particularly strong orders, and there's a very strong backlog in the business. And so as we move through the coming quarters, we expect the positive contribution of Sensia both in terms of growth and profitability to have an impact first on Lifecycle Services and then more broadly across Rockwell.Nicholas C. GangestadAnd Rob, just to build on that. In my prepared remarks, I talked about some onetime costs that we took in the second quarter to expand profitability. Some of that is focused in the Sensia area where we made some investments to simplify business infrastructure for Sensia that we think will make it even more -- build it for more profitability in the future. And so that's part of what we're seeing in our second quarter results for Sensia.Robert W. MasonExcellent. Just as a follow-up to, any thoughts, I didn't hear any commentary specific to China, just exactly what you're seeing on the ground in China and how that recovery is playing out in your business?Blake D. MoretYes. So a couple of things. First of all, in general, the growth is strong in China across the business. And it's a lot of the same contributors that we've seen in the past with areas like EV and Life Sciences and so on. So we think that our business there is posed for continued growth.OperatorOur next question comes from Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer.Andre Stillman AdamsThis is Andre on for Noah. On the M&amp;A pipeline, you've previously defined ISGS and market access in Europe and Asia and Advanced Material Handling as priorities. Could you give us any color on what's most near term for you as a focus and how active that pipeline looks today?Blake D. MoretYes. Andre, it's a good pipeline, and you said it. Those are the priorities. That's fairly broad. But within that, there's a lot of information management software in the production world. So there's some decent targets there. Cybersecurity has been extremely successful for us both organically and as we've added additional capabilities through some acquisitions, advanced material handling. We talk all the time about our Independent Cart Technology, about some of the things we're doing in robotics applications as the lines get blurred between robot control and programmable line control, and we think there's some very interesting things going on there.Obviously, add AI and autonomy to some of these areas, and there's new dimensions for value for customers. And then Europe and Asia, we're very happy, for instance, with what we're doing and it would be awesome, the Italian manufacturer of industrial PCs that also has some great software that's forming the basis for some of our most exciting new introduction. So I would say that the pipeline is good across all of those fronts.Andre Stillman AdamsGreat. And can you also just give an update on pipeline and customer needs in the EV transition starting with the upstream opportunity in lithium and any impact of the IRA and domestic battery and vehicle production where customers in that vertical focused most right now?Blake D. MoretWell, they're all focused on building up their fleet capacity so that they can get a return on these giant investments. You don't get that unless you put more jobs per hour out the door and so they're all working to be able to expand their production output. If you look on the on the road today, you still don't see a ton of electric vehicles and all of them, if you listen to those goals and you look at the trends, this is a multiyear process and -- from start to finish, starting with the lithium mines and the basic materials that are needed for the batteries, through the battery making facilities through the electric vehicle assembly.All of that has to build out to be able to get us to a point where you start seeing electric vehicles come anywhere near approaching internal combustion vehicles on the road. So this is multiple years and all of these manufacturers are focused on debottlenecking that whole supply chain, which is going to be in the news for years to come.I think the 1 other question. I mean the IRA, obviously, that helps there as well as it does with other renewable providers. We've talked before about First Solar, for instance. We talked about Oxy's 1.5 initiative. So we're seeing more and more of these come online across our verticals and people are doing it because it's important for their business models. And again, that's not a [terminal] thing. That's going to be over multiple years.OperatorOur next question comes from Phil Buller from Berenberg.Philip John BullerI was hoping you could expand on the topic of, I guess, the order funnel or pipeline rather than the backlog. I'm wondering if you're more excited about the funnel in process markets, generally speaking, more so than discrete or hybrid at this point. You've talked very helpfully about different customer examples in those like EVs and such. I'm just trying to get a handle on how it aggregates into those big process versus discrete buckets. So which funnel is getting fuller, if you will? And perhaps you can remind us if there's any structural margin differential between those, that would be great.Blake D. MoretSure. Yes, it's broad-based. I mean, we're very happy with the way that our business is balanced between discrete and hybrid and process applications with big opportunities in all of them. I mean, as we talk about EV and battery in discrete, we talk about food and beverage and Life Sciences, Food and beverage is our single biggest vertical and hybrid. And then in process, I highlighted some particularly strong order activity with Sensia, but we also continue to see good activity in metals as well. So it's across all of them.Now in terms of the margin, one to the next there's high-margin opportunities in each one. I would say that the engineered systems are concentrated a little bit more heavily on the process side. Those customers are more often looking for engineering content to complement the hardware coming from the same provider. So you'd probably see a little bit lower margin there due to the people intensivity of that, but good opportunities in the funnel for near and midterm orders across all of the industry segments.Philip John BullerOkay. Great. And just in terms of the different topic margins here. I know you've touched on the Software and Control margin. The drop through between the 3 different businesses is quite different, depending on which one you're looking at. And I know that there's been a lot of things bouncing around at the moment. So I guess I was just trying to get a handle on how you think about the H2 margin evolution for each of the 3 businesses relative to H1. Is there anything that you could point out that we should be bearing in mind beyond Software and Control, please?Nicholas C. GangestadBeyond Software and Control, which I've already covered still, when I look at intelligent devices, that's been a little over 20%, about 21% margin in the first half of this year. I think for the full year, it's going to be close to that, maybe between 20% and 21% for the full year margin for Intelligent Devices. Some of the things happening there, we continue to see good volume, good price growth, but as I talked about earlier, for the full year, we'll also be seeing higher incentive comp and higher investment spend. This is one of the places where we've been focusing some of our investment spend in resiliency and we'll see that continuing. So between 20% and 21% for Intelligent Devices. And then soft -- excuse me, Lifecycle Services. I've talked about sequential improvement. I don't see us crossing the threshold into double-digit margin until the fourth quarter. So I see Q3 being a move in that direction from where we were in the first half where we're in the little over 5% margin. We'll be stepping it up, but not all the way to 10% and then going to 10% or over in the fourth quarter.Aijana ZellnerJulian, we will take one more question.OperatorCertainly, our last question will come from Jairam Nathan from Daiwa.Jairam NathanSo I just wanted to spend a little time on the automotive. We are seeing, as the transition towards EVs, we are seeing the number of process steps coming down. And I understand Rockwell probably does not have a lot of content on welding, but do you see any implications as EVs or auto companies go from spot welding to giga casting and things like that?Blake D. MoretYes. So the net opportunity for Rockwell actually goes up as we go from internal combustion engines to EVs, and that's for a couple of reasons. First of all, the traditional drivetrain operations. That's a more subtractive manufacturing process, that's boring cylinders, that's finishing metal surfaces and things like that. And that's largely done with computer numerical control, which is not a technology that Rockwell directly has. We have good partnerships, but it's not something that we provide directly. And so when that's replaced by some of the operations in electric vehicles, most notably, the battery formation and packing and assembly. That's more of an assembly type operation. And there's aspects at the front end of that with batch processes. And those are all applications that Rockwell has great readiness to serve.Then when you look at what you specifically mentioned in the joining part of it, it's more complex press operations, and Rockwell has great press control systems. So as the metal formation becomes more complex, again, those are really good applications for Rockwell with our program of control as well as our expanded drive control. So we feel good about those opportunities. And then added to those basic automation applications. It's the software that's a more pervasive part of the electric vehicle and battery manufacturing process, and we have really good solutions there.Jairam NathanOkay. And 1 more, if I may. So I mean all the -- given your outlook, I think the 1 area which actually decline seems to be chemicals. I think you went from a high single digit from a low double -- double digits. So can you explain that a bit?Blake D. MoretNo. I don't have a specific answer for where chemical is moderating other than to say our focus in chemical is more on the specialty chemical, a fine chemical as opposed to bulk chemicals.OperatorWe have no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Ms. Zellner for closing remarks.Aijana ZellnerThank you, everyone, for joining us today. That concludes today's call.OperatorThat concludes today's conference call. At this time, you may disconnect. Thank you.]"

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis oil and gas pipe provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.18 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +1700%.Revenues are expected to be $344.34 million, up 22.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 13.46% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Expro Group Holdings?For Expro Group Holdings, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -16.67%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Expro Group Holdings will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Expro Group Holdings would post earnings of $0.21 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.12, delivering a surprise of -42.86%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Expro Group Holdings doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Oil and Gas - Production and Pipelines industry, Williams Companies, Inc. (The) (WMB) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.45 per share for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +9.8%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $3.02 billion, up 19.8% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Williams Companies, Inc. (The) has been revised 2% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, an equal Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Williams Companies, Inc. (The) will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

264,d74cc04e-1f83-322d-8bc0-66d74e06e60c,ILMN,2023-04-28,Breeding Better Sugar With Genomics,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/breeding-better-sugar-genomics-134500633.html,1682603100,STORY,['ILMN'],"[Originally published on Illumina News CenterNORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / April 27, 2023 / Folk wisdom says that putting sugar in someone's gas tank will ruin their car. Truth is, not only is that a myth, with a few extra steps, sugarcane can be turned into ethanol, a greener alternative to fossil fuels.Sugarcane is a tropical grass in the same family as bamboo, wheat, maize, and rice. Three-quarters of all sucrose in our food comes from sugarcane (the rest comes from sugar beets); it's grown in more than 80 countries, and by weight, more sugarcane is harvested than any other crop. It converts solar energy into chemical energy with nigh-unparalleled efficiency, and during its lifetime it removes so much carbon dioxide from the atmosphere that-if low-emissions practices are used in its harvesting and refinement-it can actually qualify as a carbon-neutral fuel source.It didn't start out so sweet. The two original wild species, Saccharum spontaneum and Saccharum officinarum, grown in India and New Guinea respectively, had limitations: the former had very thin stalks and the latter produced very little sucrose. Humans selectively bred the plant for thousands of years, to the point that the kind cultivated by the early 20th century was considered a whole new crop, resulting from the hybridization of those two species.This ""noble"" cane's thick stalks were saturated with sucrose, but it had lost so much genetic diversity it was vulnerable to pestilence from nearly every branch of the tree of life: The necrotic sugarcane yellow-leaf virus, the stunting bacteria Leifsonia xyli xyli, smut-causing fungal spores, and a moth whose larvae have such exclusive tastes we named it the ""sugarcane borer.""Farmers can control some of these nuisances with pesticides-which merely substitutes one problem with another. Cross-breeding the super-sweet noble cane with its hardier wild ancestor over years of research has produced some slightly more resilient cultivars, but to get the best of both worlds requires some next-generation science.Story continuesCracking the decaploid genome Enter the geneticists. For decades, the sugarcane breeding program at Texas A&amp;M AgriLife Research and Extension Center in Weslaco has been creating varieties that are specifically adapted to the Rio Grande Valley's 43,000 acres of sugarcane fields. Jorge Da Silva, a professor of the university's Department of Soil &amp; Crop Sciences, earned his PhD in plant genetic breeding at Cornell, and for 14 years before coming to the Lone Star State he served as a research scientist for Centro de Tecnologia Copersucar in Piracicaba, Brazil.A&amp;M couldn't have asked for a better résumé. Bioethanol from sugarcane represents 17% of Brazil's total energy supply; the country exports more sugar and-after the US-more ethanol than anyone else in the world; and CTC Copersucar is the country's biggest producer of both. Da Silva has devoted his career to finding the best possible genes for this crucial crop.""I love organic agriculture,"" he says. ""When I was a kid studying agronomy, I just wanted to be able to produce food without all the poisons. I realized that genetics would be the most powerful tool to reduce the amount of chemicals, just by breeding for plants that are resistant to pests, to microorganisms, to disease."" He also searches for genes that confer cold resistance, since Texas is already farther from the equator than any other sugarcane growing region. ""Imagine if we could spread sugarcane to other parts of the US that have lower temperatures. That could be a big deal for the industry.""Finding these genes hasn't been easy, in part because the sugarcane genome is absurdly large. Humans have two copies of each chromosome; our genome is ""diploid."" Plants often have more than two copies; their genome is ""polypoid."" Da Silva explains: ""A potato has four copies of each chromosome. Wheat has six. Sugarcane has ten."" Depending on the species and variety, the plant can have between 52 and 117 chromosomes total. If the human genome is a novel, the decaploid sugarcane genome is the unabridged Oxford English Dictionary. ""It's among the biggest genomes in the world. Sequencing all those chromosomes poses a big challenge for scientists.""It also turns out that attempting to replicate the incredible growth and durability of the non-food wild cane comes with complications. ""In this country, S. spontaneum is considered a noxious weed. It's against the law to plant it because it's very aggressive. It's invasive; it becomes very hard to control. For me to do research with it, I had to get a permit from the USDA, and I still have a number of restrictions. Every year after I use the cane, I have to burn everything so it won't propagate.""But years of painstaking work is paying off. Da Silva's research in Weslaco, comparing leaf chlorophyll content, leaf temperature, and relative water content in several different sugarcane genotypes subjected to a 90-day drought cycle, has generated a wealth of data about which genes are actually being expressed and controlling these traits. Genetic samples, or germplasm, from these crops have already been shared with the International Society of Sugarcane Technologies, and the US government recently awarded Da Silva's program a grant to turn their attention to ""energy cane""-sugarcane grown specifically to produce bioethanol.Food vs. fuel When you can use the same crop for either food or fuel, how do you decide which to prioritize? Demand-and economic opportunity-for fossil fuel alternatives is high, but does making biofuels mean diverting food from someone's plate, and potentially raising food prices?In this case, if we process sugarcane the right way, we may be able to burn our cake and eat it, too.To get edible sugar from the harvested plant, mill workers first crush the stalks in high-pressure rollers to squeeze out sucrose-rich juice. Then they boil the juice to remove water, and crystallize brown raw sugar in a centrifuge. That brown sugar can either be recrystallized into white sugar at a refinery, or fermented to produce bioethanol. This ""first-generation"" biofuel comes directly from an otherwise consumable food product.But what about all those leftover dry, crushed stalks? Traditionally, they were simply burned to provide heat and, through steam power, electricity for the sugar mill. But something interesting happens if you heat this ""lignocellulosic bagasse"" in the absence of oxygen: Instead of burning, it undergoes thermal decomposition, or pyrolysis, that separates the lignin from the cellulose. The lignin can then be burned to help power the sugar mill, and the cellulose can be fermented into bioethanol without sacrificing any food.This route comes with its own technological bottlenecks, and has yet to become economically viable, but it forms an important piece of the greener-fuel puzzle. That same lignocellulosic material can also be processed into composite forms of polyethylene and polypropylene-in fact, Illumina's newest and most advanced sequencing systems, NovaSeq X and NovaSeq X Plus, use a biopolymer derived from sugarcane in their reagent kit cartridges, which can be recycled after use.A plant with this many uses, and this many threats, ends up pulling its breeders in several directions at once. ""We try to pyramid, as we call it, the resistance genes to biotic stresses like diseases and pests, but it's hard to do that in addition to resistance to abiotic stresses like drought and cold,"" Da Silva says. ""We also want it to be high yield, and high sugar content.""Ultimately, one factor affects both the feasibility and direction of breeding programs like Da Silva's. ""When I first came to Texas, I asked one of the sugarcane growers here, ‘What is the most important trait you want in a new variety?' You know what he said? ‘Money in my pocket.' Whatever we do that increases money in their pocket is welcome.""With enough investment, next-generation sequencing could someday find the perfectly impervious, Swiss Army sugarcane that saves its growers money they would've otherwise spent on pesticides, that can be grown in a wider range, and-most importantly for future generations-is viable as both food and fuel.Learn more about how Illumina is integrating sustainable solutions into our value chain, and supporting research into a more sustainable food supply through the Illumina Agricultural Greater Good Initiative.Illumina, Thursday, April 27, 2023, Press release pictureNew sugarcane clone seedlings growing at Texas A&amp;M AgriLife Research &amp; Extension Center, Weslaco | Credit: Texas A&amp;M AgriLifeView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Illumina on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: IlluminaWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/illuminaEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: IlluminaView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/751648/Breeding-Better-Sugar-With-Genomics]"
265,b18b7a50-db07-321a-b06b-5d25336b71fd,PWR,2023-04-28,Earnings Preview: Quanta Services (PWR) Q1 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-quanta-services-pwr-140302844.html,1682604182,STORY,['PWR'],"[The market expects Quanta Services (PWR) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 4, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis specialty contractor for utility and energy companies is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.10 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -19.7%.Revenues are expected to be $4.08 billion, up 3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.7% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Quanta Services?For Quanta Services, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.28%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Quanta Services will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Quanta Services would post earnings of $1.61 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.68, delivering a surprise of +4.35%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Quanta Services doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsSterling Infrastructure (STRL), another stock in the Zacks Engineering - R and D Services industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.56 for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -12.5%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $385.45 million, down 6.1% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Sterling Infrastructure has remained unchanged. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -0.59%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Sterling Infrastructure will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

My name is Kathy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Southern Company First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, April 27, 2023.I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.Scott GammillThank you, Kathy. Good afternoon, and welcome to Southern Company's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Chris Womack, President of Southern Company; and Dan Tucker, Chief Financial Officer.Let me remind you, we'll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. including those discussed in our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and subsequent filings.In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Chris Womack.Story continuesChristopher C. WomackThank you, Scott, and good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. I am delighted to be joining you today on my first earnings call as President of Southern Company. I've enjoyed given the opportunity to interact with many of you over the last couple of months and look forward to meeting with many more of you in the months ahead. I am incredibly excited about the future of Southern Company, the energy industry and the valuable work that we're doing to serve our customers and communities. I am excited about the opportunities ahead of us and proud to be a part of a team that is making such a significant impact in building the future of energy.As you've watched us reposition our deep talented bench across the system, our mission remains unchanged, provide our customers and communities with clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy, while continuing to keep our customers at the center of everything we do. Also unchanged is our goal to deliver superior risk-adjusted total shareholder return. And I believe our financial plan supports that objective. The strength of our value proposition is a function of our customer and community, focused business model, the robust economic growth in our service territories and the constructive regulatory frameworks in our states. It is also a function of our discipline as we remain committed to our objectives of strong investment-grade credit ratings with a regular, predictable and sustainable dividend policy.Along with our focus on long-term execution and value accretion, we are executing on our loan -- on our plans as we -- and believe we're well positioned to achieve our financial objectives for 2023. Dan, I'll now turn the call over to you for our financial update.Daniel S. TuckerThanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. For the first quarter of 2023, our adjusted EPS was $0.79 per share, $0.18 lower than the first quarter of 2022 and $0.09 above our estimate. The major driver for the variance to last year was milder-than-normal weather as the first quarter of 2023 was the warmest on record in the Southeast. Higher depreciation and amortization and interest expense also impacted earnings for the first quarter compared to last year and were somewhat offset by constructive state regulatory actions. A complete reconciliation of our year-over-year earnings is included in the materials we released this morning. When looking at adjusted EPS impact compared to our estimate for the quarter, the main drivers were a strong start for our state regulated natural gas utilities and continued strong electric and gas customer growth.Given the mid-February timing of our last earnings call, we were able to factor milder than normal January and February weather into our estimate for the quarter, so weather was not a major driver of our performance versus our estimate. You may recall that our adjusted earnings in the first half of 2022 were significantly better than projected due to weather and other market-driven factors. Our early 2022 outperformance supported our full year adjusted EPS performance and enabled us to accelerate maintenance activities in several areas of the business. Those initiatives had us well positioned with additional spending flexibility entering 2023, such that we expect the significant weather impact we experienced in January and February should be manageable over the remainder of the year, assuming a return to more normal weather throughout the balance of the year.Turning now to retail sales in the economy. In the first quarter, weather-normal electric retail sales were 0.4% higher than the first quarter of 2022. This increase reflects stronger residential and commercial sales from continued robust net in migration to our service territories, a strong labor market and a return to more normal business trends. Industrial sales for the quarter were down 1.6% as we are beginning to see weakness in housing-related sectors, such as stone clay and glass, lumber and textiles due to inflationary pressures and higher interest rates. Half of the industrial variances for the quarter compared to last year can be attributed to the closure of a caustic soda manufacturing facility in Alabama. Excluding the impact of this single customer, industrial sales were down approximately 0.8%.In a trend that continues to differentiate our Southeast service territories from many other areas of the country, we once again saw record levels of economic development activity with job creation and capital investment announcements at all-time highs in the first quarter. We are beginning to see supplier announcements related to the Rivian and Hyundai electric vehicle manufacturing facilities in Georgia, with six supplier announcements made during the quarter, totaling over 4,200 jobs and nearly $2 billion in capital investment. We expect additional automotive supplier announcements in the coming months.Beyond the automotive industry, Qcells recently announced a new $2 billion solar panel and component manufacturing facility in Georgia, which is expected to create 2,000 jobs. Additionally, the Port of Savannah continues to set records, posting its highest national market share ever and second busiest February on record. The port continues to expand capacity, including the recent announcement of the addition of 55 electric cranes, which are expected to eliminate 500,000 gallons of diesel consumption and related emissions per year.Before I turn the call back over to Chris, I'd like to call your attention to our recent dividend increase. At its last meeting, Southern Company Board of Directors approved an $0.08 per share increase in our common dividend, raising our annualized rate to $2.80 per share. This action marks our 22nd consecutive annual increase and for 76 consecutive years, dating all the way back to 1948, Southern Company has paid a dividend that was equal to or greater than the previous year. This remarkable track record supports Southern Company's value proposition.And lastly for me, our adjusted EPS estimate for the second quarter is $0.75 per share. Chris, I'll turn it back over to you.Christopher C. WomackThank you, Dan. Before taking your questions, I'd like to first provide an update on recent progress on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Importantly, the projected completion time line and capital cost forecast for both units are unchanged from the updates that we provided last quarter. Since that time, we've seen sustained progress consistent with our expectations for each unit. At Unit 3, we've achieved initial criticality in March and successfully synced to the grid earlier this month. We continue to work through final startup testing and commissioning and are currently performing testing at the 50% thermal power plateau. This testing is expected to continue in the coming weeks with extensions to higher power plateaus and force trips to test the unit's safety systems.Following completion of this final testing sequencing, and consistent with our long-term plans, we expect Unit 3 to enter into a brief maintenance outage window before returning to full power. After the successful completion of all appropriate preoperational and power extension testing, as well as any necessary fine-tuning, Unit 3 will be ready for commercial operations. We continue to project placing Unit 3 in service in May or June of 2023.Turning now to Unit 4. Substantial progress continued throughout the last quarter, with hot functional testing commencing in March, with lessons learned from Unit 3 continuing to benefit our execution on Unit 4, Hot Functional Testing is approximately 80% complete. We have already achieved peak planned output of the test and are currently in the process of cooling the unit back down with progress throughout the test that has been consistent with our plan. We project to complete Hot Functional Testing in the coming weeks to be followed by planned inspections and surveillance, along with the middle of our final ITAAC's receipt of the 103(g) finding from the NRC and fuel load later this year. Only six systems remain for turnover to testing for Unit 4, and we continue to project an in-service date between late fourth quarter of 2023 and end of the first quarter 2024. We look forward to sharing our exciting progress in the weeks and months ahead as we bring these units online to provide reliable, carbon-free energy to the benefit of our customers in the state of Georgia for decades to come.In closing, I'd like to highlight that Southern Company was named the top utility on Forbes Magazine Best Large Employers in America 2023 rankings. We ranked nearly 100 places higher than the next industry peer and the top 15 of the 500 large employers ranked for the second consecutive year. Being recognized amongst the best in the nation once again is an honor. This accolade is particularly gratifying because it is directly based on employee feedback. We are committed to creating a workplace where all groups are well represented, included and fairly treated with all -- within all levels of the organization and that everyone feels welcome, valued and respected.At Southern Company, we aspire to be a leader in our industry. As such, we will continue to strive to create the best workplace possible for our thousands of team members who work tirelessly each and every day to provide world-class service to the customers that we have the privilege to serve. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.Steven Isaac FleishmanChris, congrats on your first call as a new role. And hi to Tom out there, I'm sure he's listening. But the -- just on -- could you just remind us for the prudency filing in Georgia, when that would -- when that comes and roughly when that's going to be scheduled this year?Christopher C. WomackIt is scheduled to come as we enter fuel load on Unit 4. Right now, we're looking to -- for unit -- for fuel load to occur in the July time frame. So we're working -- we'll work with the commission and the staff on moving through that process. But it will get started as we enter fuel load on Unit 4.Steven Isaac FleishmanOkay. And take like -- I think most things take six months pretty much in Georgia?Christopher C. WomackWe expect yes, six months. It's the time frame we expect today.Steven Isaac FleishmanOkay. And then I think -- I know you mentioned the remaining process for Unit 3 start-up, but just the testing so far -- I mean, obviously, you kept the time line, but so far in the testing, is it fair to say everything's gone as planned? Are there any issues that have come up? Just any color there.Christopher C. WomackAnd Steve, I think as you've seen before, things do come up. I would say testing has gone very well. We've experienced some trips and the systems operated as they should, but we worked our way through it. And -- but we continue to proceed and move ahead. So, so far, so good, but we know there's -- first time start-up, there's always issues. This is why we test, and we're focused on the secondary side. But I'd say so far, so good, but we continue to -- testing is always a process that we'll go through to make sure we're ready for commercial operation.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.Shahriar PourrezaChris, you guys recently just around the '24 guidance, you kind of lowered it on the back of ongoing inflation and interest rates. I guess how are you seeing things develop now? And do you see kind of opportunities to manage your exposure like we saw with the prior convertible note you issued in February, got a bit of a better sales outlook today. I guess what are some of the pushes and takes since you revised that '23 guide? It seems like there's some incremental tailwinds here.Christopher C. WomackShahriar, you asked is about '23 or '24?Shahriar Pourreza'24.Christopher C. WomackOkay. So I'm going to -- let me start, and then I'll kick it to Dan. We moved the lower end of our band down because as we pushed out, I expected start-up of commercial on Unit 4. We moved that -- we lowered the range down to $3.95. So that was based on the push on the schedule Unit 4. Dan, do you want to comment on any other aspects of guidance?Daniel S. TuckerYes. And just following on to what Chris said, once we have clarity, which again will be the end of this year, early next year on Unit 4, we'll narrow that 2024 guidance down to something that's more akin to what we typically do, around a $0.10 range or so based on the actual in-service date. All the other moving parts you mentioned, Shahriar, I mean, we kind of are where we were -- we are executing in a way to make sure that we're managing where we need to. We'll continue to be creative and thoughtful around how we're financing, particularly at the parent company. I think the convertible deal was a tremendous success. We'll see what other opportunities we have, not necessarily that specific instrument, but just to be opportunistic in the way we do that. And then from a cost perspective, everyone is seeing pressures, and we are no different. But we've got a lot of efforts underway to make sure that we're running the business as efficiently as we can in a way that continues to support that guidance range.Shahriar PourrezaGot it. And then just, Chris, I'm kind of curious maybe just your overall thoughts on the cost side because Southern doesn't really have a stated cost-cutting target like some of your peers despite obviously you guys managing O&amp;M fairly well. I guess, looking at things kind of from a fresh lens, are you seeing opportunities to cut cost incremental to your current plan maybe at the HoldCo level like shared services or even at the OpCos? I mean, I guess, is there any opportunities you see as a new CEO that could be additive to plan as we're thinking about maybe further streamlining the business?Christopher C. WomackYes. And Shahriar, I would say it's a wonderful question I'd build on what Dan has said. I mean, we will continue to look at how we can run this business more efficiently. I mean there are opportunities to create shared service opportunity to find efficiencies in places, we will do that. As you know, there's a lot of conversation and interest in, and we take it very soon to the issue of affordability. And so we will continue to find ways to put downward pressure on our pricing, find ways to look at the interest rate and inflation implications, but look to find ways to make sure, from O&amp;M perspective, that is either flat or declining over our forecast period. So we will continue to do that and pursue those kind of opportunities. And we've done it in the past, and we'll continue to do it in the future.Daniel S. TuckerAnd I'd say, in addition to the -- particularly the shared service opportunities, as Chris mentioned, one of the other great opportunities we have, which you'd hope we would have is to really optimize how our internal resources are deployed between operating expenses and capital investments. So we're certainly doing everything we can to optimize the way they're deployed to focus on our capital spend and reduce costs at the same time.Shahriar PourrezaTerrific, congrats, Chris, on your first call of many. Appreciate it.Christopher C. WomackAgain, Shahriar, thank you very much.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Ross Fowler with UBS.Ross A. FowlerSo Dan, I just want to go through the seasonality again, you kind of brought it up in your prepared remarks, but I just want to make sure I fully understand your drivers there. You hear about -- you had a little over $2 in the first half of '22, and you've got a little over $1.50 in the first half of '23. So if I heard you correctly, you said that, that outperformance in '22 allowed you to pull a lot of O&amp;M forward into the year, so that's part of it. But there's other pieces here, too, I think one would be a reduction in part of the Vogtle penalty once Unit 3 goes in. And then I think there was some sharing outside the band in Q4 of last year. So other than those three pieces, is there anything I'm missing around sort of getting back into the guidance range with a better second half number this year versus last?Daniel S. TuckerYes, not in terms of getting back, but just in terms of making those comparisons year-over-year, Ross, I think the other important moving part that we saw in the first half of last year that really helped us get up to that strong start was earnings that were really driven by where energy prices were. So not only on our regulated side, we had some commercial industrial pricing that benefited from that, but also on the Southern Power side, got off to a great start just because of where market energy prices where and it allowed us to do a lot of those things. So when you're doing a year-over-year comparison, that will be a difference. Big thing that you brought up that's just not as obvious always looking at this is the kind of rebates or refunds back to customers' notion. That was a significant element of the second half of last year if you combine all of our jurisdictions in terms of either what was accrued to refund back to customers or what was put into regulatory reserves, so we have this reliability reserves in some of our jurisdictions. That was $0.33 just in the fourth quarter.And so that's a pretty significant year-over-year reconciling item that won't necessarily be there this year, but we'll still be able to support that $3.60 as a midpoint.Ross A. FowlerAnd then on the industrial sales decline, you mentioned about half of that was sort of a one-off item due to the caustic soda facility, and the rest was kind of like seen in lateral housing-related sectors. Maybe ex-housing, what are you seeing for the economic backdrop currently in that context?Daniel S. TuckerYes. Still, and I want Chris to kind of add on to this. But just from an overall sales perspective, still seeing year-over-year growth in a lot of sectors. There is a bit of slowing going on, but the overall strength here in the Southeast continues to show itself. Chris, do you want to add anything there?Christopher C. WomackYes. And so we look at the economic development pipeline here in the Southeast, which remains to be robust, I mean I look at first quarter of '23 versus the first quarter of '22 and announced projects expect like 10,000 -- 10-plus thousand jobs and some $4 billion of investment here in Georgia and then Alabama also sees increases around EV and battery supply chain. And the pipeline continues to be very full. So we continue to be excited about the economic activity, the economic development pipeline. From population growth in migration to the customer growth, we saw somewhere 11,000 on the electric side, some 6,000 on the gas side. So we continue to see very positive factors that -- some people say there may be a recession, but we think here in our territory maybe lessen because of this ongoing continuing economic strength and economic activity that we continue to see.Ross A. FowlerThat's great, Chris. And maybe this is an unfair question, but I'm going to pose it anyway. How do you think about -- I mean, you've seen in the press this week an EPA power plant rule potentially coming around natural gas and emissions reductions. How do you think about that in terms of sustainability achievement versus affordability and reliability because natural gas is definitely needed for both of those things as we walk through the energy transition? What are the risks and opportunities around that type of regulation?Christopher C. WomackYes. And let me break that up in two parts. I mean I think in terms of the proposal and using the process before, and that will go through a number of different iterations. And when there is a final rule, we'll assess it in understanding and figure out what it means to us. I mean, we have been pursuing our fleet transition, our focus on sustainability and with a real commitment of balancing affordability with sustainability and moving toward -- towards Net Zero. I mean -- and we'll continue to do that as we go through this fleet transition. So our path will continue. And so whenever a new rule comes out, we'll take a look at it. I mean, I would also say, I think for the economy, natural gas is very important. Natural gas is important to this country and to the economy, to a lot of regions that cannot, from an affordability standpoint, make a transition to all electric. And so I think, from a national energy policy standpoint, I think it's important to recognize the importance of natural gas as we go forward. So that would be my response to that question.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithCongrats, again. So with that said, look, I want to pivot back to the credit conversation. As we kind of pivot out of the U3, U4, you look at the time lines getting a little bit narrower here. What are you guys thinking today about the prospects of credit improvement? What kind of metrics would you want to target? Obviously, you've seen some gyrations there through the course of construction -- how far do you want to go on that improvement side? What does that mean in terms of the targeted broad metrics? Again, I get that the rating agencies have different metrics they target. And then ultimately, what does that translate to in terms of target FFO for you guys? And the time line they're in, right, as you look at this in service?Daniel S. TuckerYes, Julien, it's Dan. So look, with -- once Vogtle 3 and 4 is in service, reflected in rates from a cash flow perspective, and we've talked about this before, it's about a $700 million improvement in our operating cash flow and thus improvement in FFO from an FFO to debt perspective, what that means is given the rest of our business, combined with that improvement, we should be comfortably in a let's just call it, 17-ish years zone from an FFO to debt. It could be as high as 18 in years, could be in the high 16s, but comfortably above certainly current rating thresholds.And what I've continued to articulate as an objective to have all of our regulated utilities in the A category and our parent company at BBB+. And I think we can achieve that without having to do anything but execute.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithRight. But not a further improvement in terms of the underlying metrics per se?Daniel S. TuckerAbsolutely.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithOkay. And then, sorry, if I can pivot one more subject here. Just to touch on Georgia and Georgia Power, specifically around solar opportunities. I know that IRA has unlocked certain opportunities. I know that this isn't flight in the process of maybe not necessarily right. But prospects for investing on that front. Obviously, you've had the Southern Power placeholder, but I'm focused more specifically on solar at Georgia Power and/or any of the other OpCos today post IRA. And given the RFP?Christopher C. WomackYes. And Julien, as you know, we have opportunity as a result of the 2022 integrated resource plan, but also with the, inflation reduction act, we think as a level of the playing fields between -- from tax policy, it offers us the opportunity to own renewables ourselves. And so our teams are looking at the opportunities, and we'll be working with the commissions to pursue those opportunities for us to build and on more renewables as we go forward, taking advantage of the opportunities that the inflation Reduction Act affords us. And the opportunity we have is not just looking at the lease cost, but also -- but who's the best cost owner of these projects going forward. So it's a wonderful opportunity for us. But also, I think, as you mentioned, there're also opportunities for Southern Power as we go forward.So there are wonderful opportunities for us as we go forward, and we're looking forward to fully investigating and executing around them.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithGot it. But maybe in the next quarter or so, we'll get a little bit more detail there?Christopher C. WomackWe'll keep you posted.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithAll right. Excellent, we'll leave it at that.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley.David Keith ArcaroA couple of quick questions on the Vogtle units. I was wondering when would we expect Unit 3 to be running at full capacity? We've seen it ramping up and down, getting to 50% power. Wondering when we might see it at full capacity. And then just on that Unit 2, have the -- I think you touched on this before, but has the testing and running so far been going smoothly enough to not push out any like incremental delays within the May to June time frame?Christopher C. WomackNo. And so David, we're not announcing any schedule or cost estimate increases. 100% power sometime in May. I mean, we're working through the process. We're doing all the testing and we're ramping up. I would say, look for some time in May to get to 100% power.David Keith ArcaroOkay. Got you. And then on Unit 4, just during Hot Functional, I guess, similar question. Have you seen any issues pop up during that testing phase that would add incremental time even within the 4Q to 1Q 2024 window?Christopher C. WomackAnd I think as we said, we're about 80% complete on Hot Functional on Unit 4. And I think it is clear that we have taken lessons learned from our Unit 3 experience, and there are no issues to note. And so I'd say, so far, so good. And I mean, if you recall, you may recall, Unit 3 took us about 94 days. And so we're now 80% complete. And if we stay on schedule, sometime in early May we will conclude Hot Functional Testing and then look toward critical path items of ITAACs and testing and looking toward fuel load sometime in July. So so far, so good. So that's kind of just -- that's where we are. But we've -- I mean the lessons learned from Unit 3, Unit 4, I think, are clearly reflecting in showing up as we go through Hot Functional Testing on Unit 4.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.Durgesh ChopraJust first, Chris, you talked about the maintenance outage at Unit 3. I just want to confirm that's just standard process, right? That's not an added step based on...Christopher C. WomackYes, it's . Go ahead, Durgesh.Durgesh ChopraNo, that's it. Please go ahead.Christopher C. WomackYes. No, you're right. I mean it's a standard outage. I mean, there's some testing equipment that has to be removed and some things that we have learned. And so we'll fine-tune some things, maybe some remediation that will occur probably about a 10-day maintenance outage. But yes, I mean, it's standard and what's expected.Durgesh ChopraPerfect. thank you for clarifying that. And then maybe I can just pivot to the Georgia Power under-recovered fuel filing. I believe you made that in February. Just any initial stakeholder feedback there. I know in the last call, we talked about perhaps offsetting some of that balance with lower gas prices going forward as we see it. Just anything you can share with us on that front would be great.Christopher C. WomackAs you may know, we reached a stipulation with the staff, and we're looking at about a 12% price increase on retail rates over 3-year period to recover that under-recovered fuel balance, and that would take effect in June. And that is lower than what our initial request was and 30% less than what we expected. And I think as we look at this outcome, this stipulation, it reflects kind of our sensitivity and our interest in paying attention to affordability and recognizing that we must recover this under-recovered fuel balance, but how do we do it in a manner that minimizes the impact on customers. And so that's kind of where we are. More hearings and consideration to take place, but the rates will take effect and starting in June.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc.Sophie Ksenia KarpMost of my questions have been answered actually. Let me just maybe throw this one at you guys. With Vogtle moving towards the completion Unit 3 and Unit 4 and they remain on track to be completed in the direct line of vision. Would you take some time in the medium term to have another look at the businesses that you own and maybe figure out which ones could be recycled capital wise and optimize the business mix? Or are you quite happy with what you got right now?Christopher C. WomackI mean, I think you kind of speak to it. But as we have success on Vogtle 3 and 4, it does give us the opportunity to unlock the fuel value of this company and kind of regain our premium valuation. And I mean, we will look at our business, and we'll look at all parts of it in terms of from a buyer and seller perspective. And the thing about it is, I say, we've got -- and we will always look our handover. We feel real good about the cards that we have. I mean we'll always do our homework, and we look at what others have extracted in the marketplace. But we'll also look and see some things we can do better. We don't have any equity needs. I mean we're in a very, very good spot. And so I just think it's an opportunity for us to really unlock full value and the full potential of this company as we go forward.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Seaport.Agnieszka Anna StorozynskiSo I'll ask a bit of the question. So would you actually be willing to acquire some assets now that you have seemingly a clean slate. So you have mentioned you have no equity needs. You have a strongly improving cash flow, and there are assets available for sale. For now, the way we look at you guys, you've basically sold for roughly the sector average earnings growth, which I cannot believe that you would be happy with.Christopher C. WomackAngie, I'll tell you, and I think I said it on the last answer to the last question. We are excited about the progress we're making through on these Vogtle units. And we're looking forward to bringing both units online and getting those units completed. Once we do that, I mean, we're really going to focus on really making sure that we are unlocking the full potential and the full opportunities for this business that we have, and we are large enough to do this as a stand-alone. At the same time, we're continuing to always look at our -- look at the market, look over our hand, as I said, from both a buyer and seller perspective. We'll always continue to do our homework. But we feel good about where we are. [5% to 7%] is good enough for us to be the best risk-adjusted return in the industry, and we feel good about where we are.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan with Verition.Ashar KhanCongratulations. My questions have been answered. Thank you.OperatorThat will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Sir, are there any closing remarks?Christopher C. WomackGuys, we thank you for being with us today. and we look forward to speaking with you in the future. But otherwise, operator, thank you very much for the call.OperatorThank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Southern Company First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.]"

I will now turn the call over to Andrew Schaeffer, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets of MAA, for opening comments. Please go ahead.Story continuesAndrew SchaefferThank you, Phyllis, and good morning, everyone. This is Andrew Schaeffer, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets for MAA. Members of the management team also participating on the call with me this morning are Eric Bolton, Tim Argo, Al Campbell, Rob DelPriore, Joe Fracchia and Brad Hill. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of this discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our '34 Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data. Our earnings release and supplement are currently available on the For Investors page of our website at www.maac.com. A copy of our prepared comments and an audio recording of this call will also be available on our website later today. After some brief prepared comments, the management team will be available to answer questions. I will now turn the call over to Eric.H. Eric BoltonThanks, Andrew, and good morning. As detailed in our earnings release, first quarter results were ahead of expectations as solid demand for apartment housing continues across our portfolio. Consistent with the trends that we've seen for the past couple of years, solid employment conditions, positive net migration trends and the high cost of single-family ownership are supporting continued demand for apartment housing across our portfolio. And while new supply deliveries are expected to run higher over the next few quarters, we continue to see net positive absorption across our portfolio. We believe that MAA's more affordable price point, coupled with the unique diversification strategy, including both large and secondary markets, further supported by an active redevelopment program, will help mitigate some of the pressure from higher new supply in several of our markets.As outlined in our earnings release, our team is capturing steady progress and strong results from our various redevelopment and unit interior upgrade programs. We are on target to complete over 5,000 additional unit interior upgrades this year in addition to completing installation of new smart home technology for the entire portfolio. We're also making great progress with our more extensive property repositioning projects, with the projects completed to date capturing NOI yields in the high teens on incremental capital investment. These projects, coupled with a number of new technology initiatives, should provide additional performance upside from our existing portfolio. Our new development and lease-up pipeline is performing well, and we remain on track to start 4 new development projects later this year. Our various lease-up projects have achieved rents that are close to 11% ahead of pro forma. We did not close on any acquisitions or dispositions during the quarter, but continue to believe that transaction activity will pick up over the summer and have kept our assumptions for the year in place. The portfolio is well positioned for the important summer leasing season. Total occupancy exposure at the end of the quarter, which is a combination of current vacancy plus notices to move out, is consistent with where we stood at the same point last year. In addition, leasing traffic remains solid, with on-site visits in comparison to the number of exposed units that we have is actually running slightly ahead of prior year. A number of new leasing tools that we implemented over the course of last year should continue to support stronger execution, and our teams are well prepared for the upcoming summer leasing season. I want to thank our associates for their hard work over the last few months to position us for continued solid performance over the balance of the year. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments, and I'll now turn the call over to Tim.Timothy P. ArgoThanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Same-store growth for the quarter was ahead of our expectations with stable occupancy, low resident turnover and rent performance slightly ahead of what we expected. Blended lease-over-lease pricing of 3.9% reflects the normal seasonality pattern that we expected. And while we did return to a more typical seasonal pattern in Q1, it is worth noting that the blended lease-over-lease pricing captured was higher than our typical Q1 performance. As discussed last quarter, we expected new lease pricing to show typical seasonality, and that the renewal pricing, which lagged new lease pricing for much of 2022, would provide a catalyst to first quarter pricing performance. This played out as expected, with new lease pricing down slightly at negative 0.5%, and renewal pricing increasing positive 8.6%.Alongside the strong pricing performance, average daily occupancy remained steady at 95.5% for the first quarter, contributing to overall same-store revenue growth of 11%. The various demand factors we monitor were strong in the first quarter and continued that way into April. 60-day exposure, which represents all current vacant units plus those units with notices to vacate over the next 60 days, at the end of Q1 was largely consistent with prior year at 7.7% versus 7.9% in the first quarter of last year. Furthermore, in the first quarter, lead volume was higher than last year and quarterly resident turnover was down, driving the 12-month rolling turnover rate down 30 basis points from 2022.April to-date trends remain consistent as exposure remains in line with the prior year, and occupancy has remained steady at 95.5%. Blended lease-over-lease pricing effective in April is 4.1% with new lease pricing beginning to accelerate, up 110 basis points from March at plus 0.2%, and renewal pricing remaining strong at 7.9%. We expect renewal pricing to moderate some against tougher comps as we move into the late spring and summer, but simultaneously expect some seasonal acceleration in new lease-over-lease rates. We expect new supply in several of our markets to remain elevated in 2023, putting some pressure on rent growth. But as mentioned, the various demand indicators remain strong, and we expect our portfolio to continue to benefit from population growth, new household formations and steady job growth. In addition, we expect resident turnover to remain low as single-family affordability challenges support fewer move-outs. MAA's unique market diversification of portfolio strategy, coupled with a more affordable price point as compared to the new product being delivered, also helps lessen some of the pressures surrounding higher new supply deliveries. During the quarter, we continued our various product upgrade initiatives. This includes our interior unit redevelopment program, our installation of smart home technology and our broader amenity-based property repositioning program. For the first quarter of '23, we completed over 1,300 interior unit upgrades and installed over 18,000 smart home packages. We now have about 90,000 units with smart home technology, and we expect to finish out the remainder of the portfolio in 2023. For our repositioning program, leases have been fully or partially repriced at the first 13 properties in the program, and the results have exceeded our expectations with yields on cost in the upper teens. We have another 7 projects that will begin repricing in the second and third quarters and are evaluating an additional group of properties to potentially begin construction later in 2023. Those are all of my prepared comments. I'll now turn the call over to Brad.Adrian Bradley HillThank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. While operating fundamentals across our platform have remained consistent, as Tim just outlined, transaction volume remains muted due to a lack of for-sale inventory on the market. For high-quality, well-located properties, bidding is strong and available capital is aggressively competing in order to win the bid and put capital to work. This strong relative investor demand, coupled with often favorable in-place financing, continues to support stronger-than-expected cap rates on closed transactions. Having said that, we believe the need to sell increases as the year progresses, and it's likely that more compelling acquisition opportunities will materialize later in the year.Therefore, we have maintained our acquisition forecast for the year, but have pushed the timing back a couple of months. Our acquisition team remains active in the market, and Al and his team have our balance sheet in great shape and ready to support our transaction needs. The properties managed by our lease-up team continue to outperform our original expectations, generating higher earnings and creating additional long-term value. To date, our new lease-up properties' performance does not appear to be impacted by increased supply pressures. As Eric mentioned, these properties have achieved rents nearly 11% above our original expectations. During the first quarter, we began pre-leasing at our Novel Daybreak community in Salt Lake City, and early leasing demand is extremely strong, with the property currently 11.5% pre-leased at rents well ahead of our expectations. Predevelopment work continues to progress on a number of projects, 4 of which should start construction in the back half of 2023: 2 in-house developments, 1 located in Orlando and 1 in Denver, and 2 prepurchased joint venture developments, 1 located in Charlotte and the other a Phase 2 to our West Midtown development in Atlanta. During the first quarter, we purchased a Phase 2 land site to our Packing District project in Orlando, Florida, bringing our future development projects owned or under construction to 12, representing over 3,300 units.Over the past few months, we have seen an increase in inbound prepurchase development opportunities due to a substantial decline in the availability of both debt and equity capital for new developments. We remain disciplined and selective in our review process, but we are hopeful these calls will lead to additional currently unidentified development opportunities. Any project we start over the next 12 to 18 months would likely deliver in 2026 or 2027, and should be well positioned to capitalize on what we believe is likely to be a much stronger leasing environment, reflective of the significant slowdown in new starts that we expect to continue to see over the balance of 2023 and 2024. Our construction management team remains focused on completing and delivering our 6 under construction projects and are doing a tremendous job managing these projects and working with our contractors to minimize inflationary and supply chain pressures on our development costs and our schedules. We have 2 projects that we'll be delivering units during the second quarter, Novel Daybreak in Salt Lake City, which delivered 6 units late in the first quarter, and Novel West Midtown in Atlanta. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn it over to Al.Albert M. CampbellThank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Reported core FFO per share of $2.28 for the quarter was $0.06 above the midpoint of our quarterly guidance. About half of this favorability was related to the timing of certain expenses, which are now expected to be incurred over the remainder of the year, primarily related to real estate taxes. Operating fundamentals overall were slightly favorable to expectations for the quarter, producing about $0.01 per share of favorability. And the remaining outperformance is related to overhead and net interest costs for the quarter. Our balance sheet remains in great shape, providing both protection from market volatility and capacity for strong future growth. We received an upgrade from Moody's during the quarter, bringing our investment-grade rating to the A3 or A- level with all 3 agencies. We expect the favorable ratings to have a growing positive impact on our cost of capital as we work through future debt maturities. During the quarter, we also closed on the settlement of our forward equity agreement, providing approximately $204 million net proceeds towards funding our development and other capital needs. We funded $38 million of redevelopment, repositioning and smart home installation costs during the quarter, producing solid yields. We also funded just over $65 million of development costs during the quarter toward the projected $300 million for the full year. As Brad mentioned, we expect to start several new deals later this year and early next year, likely expanding our development pipeline to over $1 billion, for which our balance sheet is -- remains well positioned to support. We ended the quarter with record low leverage, our debt to EBITDA of 3.5x, with over $1.4 billion of combined cash and available capacity under our credit facility, with 100% of our debt fixed against rising interest rates for an average of 7.7 years and with minimal near-term debt maturities. And finally, in order to reflect the first quarter earnings performance, we are increasing our core FFO guidance for the full year to a midpoint of $9.11 per share, which is a $0.03 per share increase. We're also slightly narrowing the full year range to $8.93 and $9.29 per share. Given that the majority of the Q1 same-store outperformance was timing related and the bulk of the leasing season is ahead of us, we are maintaining our same-store guidance ranges as well as all of the key ranges for the year. So that's all we have in the way of prepared comments. Of course, we will now turn the call back over to you for questions. Course, we'll now turn the call back over to you for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And we will take our first question from Kim, John, with BMO Capital Markets.John P. KimEric and Tim both mentioned in your prepared remarks that the more affordable price point is one of the reasons why you have such strong demand. And I'm wondering if there's any notable difference between your A and B product as far as demand or performance?Timothy P. ArgoYes, John, this is Tim. I mean we are seeing a little bit of a diversion, not significant, I would say, in Q1. Our what you might call our more B assets were about 70 basis points or so higher on blended pricing versus the more A and some things -- part of it is some of the price point. And certainly, to the extent we've seen some supply pressure, more of it's coming in typically in the more urban or A style types of assets.John P. KimOkay. My second question is on the premiums that you're getting on renewals versus the new leases signed. I think it was 900 basis points in the first quarter, a little bit lower than 800 basis points in the second quarter so far. It still seems like a record amount as far as that premium you're getting. And I'm wondering when you think it goes back to the norm. At what level do you think it's fair premium on renewals?Timothy P. ArgoYes. I mean we talked about a little bit last quarter that we knew with kind of the unusual circumstances of last year, where new lease pricing was ahead of renewal pricing for the bulk of 2022, that set us up with some good comps and some opportunity on the renewal side, particularly in the first, call it, 5, 6 months in 2023. And so that's definitely what we've seen. I think as we get a little further in, you'll see it moderate to more normal. I think it'd probably get down to the 6% or so range over the next few months, but don't expect it to be too volatile. We still think renewals will outpace new leases, but get into a little bit more normalized range.OperatorAnd we'll take our next question from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital.Austin Todd WurschmidtEric, you have highlighted that the price point does provide you some insulation as it relates to new supply. And certainly, job growth has surprised to the upside earlier this year. If we start to see job growth slow, does that become more concerning as supply begins to ramp? And does pricing power just become more challenging for you later this year and maybe into early 2024?H. Eric BoltonWell, Austin, certainly, if we see the employment markets pull back in any material way, that will have an effect on demand at some level. I think that we've been through those periods before where the employment markets get much weaker. And there's no doubt that such a scenario does have an effect on demand. Having said that, we're in, I think, a unique -- all these cycles have their own sort of unique elements to them. And in this particular cycle, the -- what we see happening in the single-family market and the lack of single-family affordability is clearly working in our favor right now. And I would also suggest to you that in the event of a recession where there is weakness in the employment markets, what really helps us, at least on a relative basis, I think, is the fact that we are oriented in the Sunbelt. I think these Sunbelt markets have demonstrated historically an ability to weather downturn more so than some of the higher-density coastal markets that tend to be more dominated by financial services, insurance and banking. The diversification that we have in our -- that's one of the slides in our presentation deck, that you can look at the latest presentation deck, that really gives some insight on the diversification we have, not only in markets but also in the employment sectors that we cater to that our residents work in. And I think that diversification, coupled with the Sunbelt, some of the other things that are relating to single family and so forth, while I think a recession certainly creates concern for everybody in the apartment sector, I think that I'm confident, as we have historically always done in downturns, that we'll likely hold up better.Austin Todd WurschmidtThat's all very helpful. And then just for my follow-up, for projects that are in lease-up today, have you kind of -- have you seen any slowdown in the pace of lease-up or absorption for those? And where are concessions today for, yes, assets in lease-up?Adrian Bradley HillAustin, this is Brad. We really haven't seen any impact, negative impact associated with supply pressures on our new lease-ups. And generally, that's where you'd think we would see it first. We've got 6 or so projects that are in lease-up right now. Concessions on those, we typically model about a month free. I'd say on 3 of those, we're using some concession, maybe up to 0.5 month free. We're not using the full concessions that we underwrote, and we're not seeing the need to just generally based on what we're seeing in the market. And I'd say our traffic continues to be really good on all of our lease-ups. The leases we're signing, the velocity is really, really good. So we're not seeing any early indications yet that, that new supply is having an impact there.OperatorAnd we'll take our next question from Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs.Chandni LuthraYou guys talked about in your prepared remarks that cap rates are still going strong for good quality product. Could you remind us where they are tracking at the moment? And then as you think about your own opportunity set down the line, as you think about distressed opportunities emanating from the current supply situation and lending markets, where would cap rates need to be for you to be comfortable buying and getting in the market?Adrian Bradley HillYes, this is Brad. I'll certainly jump on that. We continue to see cap rates, call it, in the 4.7, 4.75 range for assets that fit that description, well located, strong markets. Interestingly, in the first quarter, I mean we only had 7 data points. So again, it's -- the volume is down, call it, 70% year-over-year. So we don't have a whole lot of data points. But interestingly, the band of those 7 trades is pretty close together, so -- which we haven't seen that historically. I would say for us, cap rates definitely need to be over 5, 5.25, 5.5, something in that range. But I would say it's really going to depend on the asset, what the rent trajectory looks like. And we're also looking at the after CapEx, what it looks like in that nature as well. So that's pretty important to us. And I would say where opportunities might come for us are going to be properties that are early in their lease-up. That's where some of these developers tend to get a little bit more stress in their underwriting and in their performance. As some of the supply in our markets begins to come online, some of these less experienced operators that are operating some of these new lease-ups could potentially struggle a bit to lease up those assets. And so I do think that's going to be an opportunity for us. And in fact, that's really what our acquisition forecast is built on, is buying assets that are in their initial stage of lease-up.Chandni LuthraThat's very helpful. And for my follow-up, as we think about new supply from a geographic standpoint, what are the markets where you're seeing most pressure? And how are you thinking about balancing occupancy versus pricing in those markets?Timothy P. ArgoChandni, this is Tim. Right now, I'd Austin is probably the #1 market in terms of where we're seeing supply. And Phoenix, to an extent, we're seeing a little bit. Honestly, some of the higher supply markets we're seeing like Raleigh and Charlotte, Charleston are 3 of the markets where we're seeing a fair amount of supply, have also been some of our best pricing markets so far this year. So as Eric kind of laid out earlier, we're not seeing a lot of pressure yet from supply. We're still getting the job growth and demand. There's pockets here and there. But right now, as we did in Q1, we're happy to keep pushing on price where we can. Our occupancy is at a stable point. And there's a lot of things we monitor as kind of leading-edge demand indicators, but still in a healthy balance right now.OperatorWe will go next over to Michael Goldsmith with UBS.Michael GoldsmithEarlier, you talked about the B product outperforming A product on a portfolio level. I was wondering if we can dive into a market or 2 to just kind of better understand some of the dynamics of what you're seeing in the A product versus the B product? And then also within that, can we talk about kind of like the larger markets that you're in versus the smaller markets? And if A versus B is performing differently in the large ones versus the smaller ones?Timothy P. ArgoYes. It's fairly consistent, I would say. Atlanta is probably a good example where we have quite a bit of diversification there. We've got several assets kind of in town, Midtown, Buckhead and then a lot of assets outside the perimeter, and we're pretty consistently seeing the suburban assets perform better than those more urban assets. And that's playing out relatively consistent across some of the markets. We are seeing what you might call our secondary markets perform pretty well. I mentioned Charleston a moment ago. Savannah, Greenville, some of these more secondary markets are holding up very well and doing really well in terms of pricing. And that's part of the strategy. I mean typically, those markets aren't going to get quite as much of the supply as some of these larger markets, and that's playing out for us pretty well so far.Michael GoldsmithAnd then my follow-up question just is on the -- we talked about the job market and how the portfolio may react to that. I guess my question is more related to just the in-migration to the Sunbelt. And what's that looking like versus pre-COVID levels? And are there any markets that you're seeing where it is stronger or weaker in-migrations?H. Eric BoltonMichael, this is Eric. I would tell you that the in-migration that we're -- we saw in the first quarter with about 11% of the leases that we are writing a function of people moving into the Sunbelt, that's pretty consistent with where we were prior to COVID. It began to move up a bit during 2020, late 2020 and throughout most of 2021, and then it started moderating a little bit in 2022. But right now, as we sit here today, roughly 11% or so of the move-ins that we are seeing are coming from people moving in from outside the Sunbelt. And that compares to 9% to 10% that we saw prior to COVID. Move-outs from the Sunbelt, the turnover we have where people are leaving us and moving out of the Sunbelt is still only about 3% to 4% of the move-outs that we're having are a function of people leaving the region. So on a net basis, we're pretty close to where we were prior to COVID and would expect that those trends will likely now continue at the current level going forward.Michael GoldsmithAnd when you say going forward, does that mean for the rest of '23? Or is that kind of for the intermediate term?H. Eric BoltonI would say the rest of '23 into '24. I think that, again, harking back to my earlier comments relating to the potential for moderation in the employment markets, we've seen these trends through these cycles that we've been through over the years, where migration trends are more positive, if you will, in the Sunbelt region. And it's been that way for many, many years through recessions and through expansions in the economy. That continues to be the case. And so I just continue to think that these markets and the portfolio strategy we have will serve us well long term. And I think the net positive migration trends that we see today will likely persist for the foreseeable future.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.Nicholas Philip YulicoI was hoping to get a little bit of a feel for how the new lease growth on signings is differing by market. Just sort of an order of magnitude between better versus weaker markets, if you can give a little color on that.Timothy P. ArgoYes. Nick, it's Tim. So if we think about where April is, it's anywhere from, call it, negative 1%, negative 2% for some of the lower markets up to 3%, 4%, 5% on some markets. And it moved positive in April. As we talked about, we're at 0.2%, and we saw a good acceleration from March to April. We kind of expect to see that typical seasonality and a little more acceleration as we move through the spring and summer, but that gives you a little bit of an order of magnitude.Nicholas Philip YulicoThat's helpful. Do you mind also just maybe saying which markets are the better versus weaker in that range?Timothy P. ArgoYes. I mean as I mentioned before, Austin is one of the weaker ones. Austin and Phoenix are 2 that I would point out as a little bit on the weaker side. Orlando continues to be one of our strongest markets. And then I mentioned a moment ago as well, we're seeing some of our more secondary markets perform really well. Also Charleston, Savannah, Richmond, Greenville, all holding up really well also.Nicholas Philip YulicoThat's helpful. Just last question is on Atlanta. If you look, the occupancy there is a bit lower than the rest of the portfolio. Can you just talk about what's going on there? And I guess, also on Packing, I think you were saying that that's a market where suburban is doing better than urban. And so I'm not sure if it's -- if there's any sort of supply impact there that you're dealing with on occupancy or what's driving that.Timothy P. ArgoSure. Yes, Atlanta is a little bit of a unique situation. So back in February, we had some winter storms. It affected Texas and Georgia also, but we particularly saw some impact in Atlanta and Georgia. We had about 70 units in Atlanta that were down, that we took out of service through the storm and then brought them back up kind of in late February. So you had a pretty good chunky units in Atlanta that we had to get leased up. So that was really the occupancy story there. We've seen it -- it kind of bottomed out in March, but we have seen April occupancy pick up. So I think Atlanta will continue to improve and be a pretty solid market for us later in the year.OperatorWe will go next to Alan Peterson with Green Street.Alan Robert PetersonTim, I was just hoping you can shed some light on your planning for peak leasing. And if you're anticipating in some of your weaker markets, whether or not you're going to have to use concessions to maintain occupancy, call out the Austins or the Phoenixes of the world.Timothy P. ArgoYes. I mean there will be pockets. We're not -- we certainly haven't seen -- don't expect to see it at any sort of portfolio-wide level. If we look at Q1, total concessions were about 25 basis points as a percent of rent. We are seeing a little more in Austin, call it, half a month up to a month, and then there's areas where if there's lease-up properties, you may see a little bit more markets like Orlando, we're seeing no concessions, but we'll see it a little bit, but I don't think any more than half to a month more than what we're kind of seeing right now. I don't really see it getting much different than what we see today.Alan Robert PetersonUnderstood. And that's on your assets or other competing assets nearby?Timothy P. ArgoMore so on competing assets. I mean we have some. As I mentioned, there's -- it's pretty minimal. And it kind of depends on the market. There are some markets where upfront concessions are more of staying in that market, whereas others, it's more of a net pricing scenario where you don't really see upfront concessions. So it kind of depends, but similar, whether it's our properties or the market in general.Alan Robert PetersonAppreciate that. And Brad, just one follow-up on your prepared remarks about debt and equity capital starting to dry up. The cost of buckets of capital out there, where are some of your private peers the most concerned about when sourcing new financing today? What are some of the -- whether it be the banks or life insurance companies, what buckets of capital right now are the ones that are seeing the most impact there?Adrian Bradley HillYes. I mean most of our partners use bank financing for their developments. And so I'd say that's the biggest concern at this point. And given the last few weeks and just the restriction there in capital with banks, it's more acute than it has been. First quarter, it was difficult. Equity was difficult. Debt was difficult. And I'd say the debt piece has gotten even more difficult for them. But generally, they're going to regional banks for their banking needs. And they generally have strong relationships with these banks so they can get a deal or 2 done with the banks, but it's a lot more difficult. It takes a lot longer than what it has in the past. And so that's really restricting. One of the other areas that it's restricting, new deals getting done, and I don't see that changing for the foreseeable future.OperatorWe'll go next to Rob Stevenson with Janney.Robert Chapman StevensonEric or Brad, you guys added a Orlando land parcel this quarter. But overall, how aggressively are you going to be in adding additional land parcels for development at this point? And are you seeing any relief in terms of the costs of land? Some of the peers have spoken about more office sites and vacant movie theaters and as such being sold for apartment development, allowing for better deals. Curious as to what you're seeing in terms of that.Adrian Bradley HillYes, Rob, this is Brad. As I mentioned, we have 12 sites now that we either own or control. So we feel like we're in a good spot in terms of building out our pipeline going forward. And as Al mentioned, we think we're on pace for that $1 billion, $1.2 billion or so in terms of projects going, and we like where we're located. The asset that we purchased in Orlando is a Phase 2 to a project that we'll start this year. So there was a strategic reason for that. It's really a covered land play. There's some leased buildings on it right now. So I'd say going forward, we'll be a bit more cautious on land. I would say we'll continue to look for sites that have been dropped by other developers. We'll look to get time. A couple of the sites we have now, as I mentioned, are we control them, we do not own them. So that's our preference, to have time on the deals. And I'd say we're on the early stages or it appears that we're in the early stages of land repricing a bit in some areas. We've seen a 10% price reduction on some of the projects that some of the -- our partners are coming to us with sites for. They've been able to negotiate some additional time and some cost reduction. So I think we're on the early stages of that at this point.Robert Chapman StevensonOkay, that's helpful. And then Tim or Al, where is bad debt or delinquency today? And how does that compare to the historical periods pre-COVID in recent comparable periods?Timothy P. ArgoYes, Rob, this is Tim. So if we look at Q1, for example, all the rents that we billed in Q1, we collected 99.4% of that, so 60 basis points of bad debt, which is consistent, right in line with where we were last year. If you factor in prior month collections and any collection agency, it goes down about 50 basis points. So really remains pretty minimal.Robert Chapman StevensonAnd is there any markets in particular that you're seeing any material higher amounts in?Timothy P. ArgoAtlanta is probably the one I would point out where it's just still kind of the court system and everything going on there, it's taken a little longer to move through the process. So it's our highest one right now, probably closer to around 1% or so. But that's really the only market where we're seeing that.OperatorAnd we will go next to Omotayo Okusanya with Credit Suisse.Omotayo Tejamude OkusanyaHoping you can help me understand the increase in guidance a little bit better. Again, you kind of talked about in 1Q, you had some OpEx kind of tailwinds that could potentially become headwinds going forward. So you're not changing same-store NOI. But so trying to really understand, what was that slide (inaudible), number one? And then number two, it sounds like based on spring leasing fees and you see the [FFO] guidance with them.Albert M. CampbellYes, Tayo, that's a good question. As we talked about a little bit, we -- the first quarter, obviously, we outperformed $0.06 according to our midpoint. And about half of that was timing, as I mentioned. It's really some expenses, some favorability we had in the first quarter. The bulk of that was real estate taxes that we still think our full year guidance number is correct, so we'll fill that over the year. So the first $0.03 increase in core FFO was the other items coming through. I would say, 1/3 of that or $0.01 was really operating forms. As Tim mentioned, we were favorable, particularly in pricing. It was, for the first quarter, what we expect. I think we -- if you remember our guidance or our discussion in same guidance was that our pricing expectation for the full year was 3% and the quarter, first quarter, is 3.9%. So that's a little bit of favorability. But given that we have the bulk of the leasing season ahead of us, a lot of work to be done, we just felt like our ranges in our guidance are still where they need to be there. And the other part of the favorability of FFO that flowed through were things below NOI, overhead, interest and those things. So really, the same store was good that we were -- I would call it favorable -- slightly favorable to on point of what we expected. And we'll wait to see what happens over the next couple of quarters.Omotayo Tejamude OkusanyaGot you. Okay. That's helpful. And then can you just talk a bit about kind of new lease spreads for the quarter? Again, that was kind of -- it was negative. Just kind of see as the thoughts there, whether it really is a supply issue, whether there's a bit more of a demand issue and how we should kind of think about that kind of especially going into like your core spring leasing season?Timothy P. ArgoYes. Tayo, this is Tim. I mean I think one thing to keep in mind, the new lease rates that we saw in Q1 are really pretty typical if we go back through history. If you look outside of last year, the kind of the lease rates we were seeing were pretty much in line or better, frankly, than most of the years we've been tracking it. So it was pretty much as expected. I mean March new lease rates dropped a little bit, and it was really more function of similar to what I was talking about with Atlanta earlier where we saw leasing activity drop for a couple of weeks there in February with some of the stores, particularly in Texas and Georgia, that impacted occupancy a little bit in February. And then we were able to regain that occupancy in March, but it did come at the expense a little bit of some of the new lease pricing, but as we talked about with April, where we saw new lease spreads accelerate and move positive. So from where we sit right now, all the demand metrics look strong, exposures where we want it, leads, traffic volume, all that is where we would expect. So I think we'll move into the rest of the spring and the summer, a strong leasing season and see some acceleration and see what we would typically expect out of a pretty strong supply-demand dynamic.OperatorAnd we will go next to Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.Beier LuoThis is Barry Luo on for Haendel St. Juste. My first question was on property taxes. I was just wondering how that was trending versus expectations since [Cato's] release in the back half.Albert M. CampbellYes, this is Al. I can give you some color on that. So right now, we expect that our estimates that we put out in our guidance for property taxes, we left that the same. We think we still have a good range that we've got. We did have some favorability in the first quarter on property taxes, as I just mentioned a minute ago, but really that's related to the timing of some of the activity. We had some -- the appeals from prior year, they come in and the timing can be different year-to-year. We had some wins that we achieved in the first quarter on some of our prior year [pills] that were good. We got them a little earlier than we thought. We still have a lot of fights both for prior year to go and a lot of the information for this year to come in. So on balance, we have about 6.25% growth that we expected for this year. We still -- at the midpoint of our guidance, we still think that is right.I would tell you that we still, in terms of current year, don't have a lot of information yet. We feel like we have a good view on value, but a lot of the information, the stubs from the municipalities come out probably mostly in the second quarter. So as we're talking next quarter, I should have 60% to 70% knowledge on that. And then the millage rates will come more in the third and even some in the fourth quarter. So we feel like our range is good. I would say that we've continued -- the pressures coming from Texas, Florida and Georgia, that's continuing to be the case as it has been for several years. I would say that as we move forward into 2024, as they're looking backwards toward this more normalized year, hopefully, we begin to see some moderation in that line.Beier LuoGot it. Okay. And just we get Texas in particular, so noticing a significant expense decline sequentially, so 11% for Fort Worth and I think 6% for Austin. Is some of that being driven by property tax relief? Or what's kind of driving that?Albert M. CampbellI think there's some property tax in that for sure, but I mean Tim can answer as well. But I think overall, we expected the first quarter expenses for all categories together in the company has held to be pretty high in the first quarter. Really for many of the groupings, because of the comparisons for last year as we saw inflation kind of come into our business more in the second, third and fourth quarter last year, we expected our property -- our operating expenses to be high. Actually, they were 8.3% so where we came out was favorable to our expectations, what we had said, as Tim mentioned. So what we would expect to see is some key items, personnel, repair and maintenance begin to moderate as we move back into the second, third and fourth quarter of the year, with really the outstanding points of continued pressure being taxes, insurance areas primarily. Does that answer the question?Beier LuoSo -- well, I was more looking at like the sequential decline from 4Q in Fort Worth versus 1Q in Fort Worth (inaudible).Timothy P. ArgoYes. I think the sequential decline, all those Texas markets, I think, was pretty much real estate tax relief. Just the timing of accruals and settlements and all that, it can be pretty volatile from quarter-to-quarter but normalizes over the course of the year.Albert M. CampbellYes. And that's where you're seeing some of those items, particularly in Texas, where we had the real estate tax prior appeals coming in, that's some of that occurring.OperatorAnd we will go next to Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.Alexander David GoldfarbSo 2 questions. First, just going back to the supply just because it's a big topic that always comes up with the Sunbelt. You guys articulated a lot of how your portfolio is doing. Would you say it's more just your rent versus new supply? Or would you say it's more just proximity, meaning that your properties are less of -- end up less likely to be near where the new supply is? Meaning that the new supply is in other parts of the market, and therefore, like where you cited some supply-heavy markets where you guys actually did well, it's because just proximity, in general, your portfolio doesn't line up where a lot of the new product is being built. I'm just trying to understand.H. Eric BoltonAlex, this is Eric. I would say it's both of the points that you're making that are at play here. Where we do see supply coming into a market, more often than not, it is in some of the more urban-oriented submarkets. And when you look at our portfolio and the footprint we have and the diversification we have across a number of these markets, particularly the big cities like Atlanta and Dallas, we have generally more exposure to the suburban markets versus the urban markets. So I think there is a supply proximity point that I would point to that you're mentioning that probably works in our favor to some degree. It's hard to -- and it will vary, of course, by market. And then the other thing that you pointed to, which I think is also at play here, is the price point that, broadly, we have our portfolio. When you look at the average effective rent per unit of our portfolio and compare it to the average rent of the new product coming into the markets, we still are somewhere in the 25% plus or minus range below where new product is pricing. And again, it will vary a bit by market, but that certainly provides some level of protection against the supply pressure and offers the rental market a great value play in renting from us versus something that may be down the street that's newer, but considerably more expensive. And with some of the renovation work that we're doing, frankly, that's what creates the opportunity for us to do some of this renovation work and effectively offer the resident in the market what it feels like a brand-new apartment on the interior, but still at a meaningful discount to what they would have to pay in rent for something brand new. So there are a multitude of factors that play and it varies by market. But certainly, we cannot absolutely eliminate new supply pressure, but there, after being in this region for 30 years, we've learned how to do some things to help at least mitigate the pressure a little bit here and there.Alexander David GoldfarbOkay. Second question is on insurance, certainly a hot topic, especially in Florida and Texas with big premium jumps. Are you guys seeing opportunities where some of your smaller players or maybe some of the merchant recent new developments may have -- they may not have underwritten 50% type premium increases, and therefore, that could gin up some buying opportunities? Do you think that you would see that potentially, people having to sell because of insurance pressure?Adrian Bradley HillThis is Brad. I definitely think that, that is something to keep an eye on. I do think the market down there right now is extremely tough. And depending on where you are in Tampa or South Florida, those insurance premiums are increasing substantially for new product. So I would say for newly developed properties in those areas, Tampa, Orlando, not as much, but Jacksonville, it's something for us to keep an eye on because I do think that the insurance premiums are going to be a lot higher than the developer underwrote, than they expected. And I do think there's going to be some impact to the sales proceeds as a part of that. And so I think as you get some of the supply pressures coupled with that and some of the leasing pressures, those are areas that we'll keep an eye on. And then obviously, we have the benefit with our broader portfolio and insurance pricing that, that definitely is a platform benefit for us.OperatorWe will go next to Wes Golladay with Baird.Wesley Keith GolladayJust had a quick question on capital allocation. I know your stock's yielding low 6 to maybe mid-6 implied cap. So how do you view a potential buyback versus starting new developments at this part of the cycle?H. Eric BoltonWell, Wes, this is Eric. I would tell you, right now, we believe that what really is important to have is a lot of strength in capacity on the balance sheet. Obviously, we're in a very turbulent environment at the moment. Capital markets are very turbulent. There's still obviously some level of risk in the broader economy. And so we really believe that the thing to do right now is to protect capacity and keep the balance sheet in a strong position, not only for defensive reasons. But as Brad has alluded to, we do think as we get later in the year that we may see some improving opportunities on the acquisition front. We have 4 -- as Brad alluded to, we have 4 projects that we may start. We're scheduled to start later this year. These are projects that would deliver in 2026 into 2027. So I think that, that level of development is something that we feel very comfortable with. These would be -- of course, it's -- we're still fine-tuning a lot of the numbers and pricing is not yet locked in. But we are seeing some early indication of some relief on some of the pricing metrics. And of course, by the time we get to '26 and '27, we think the leasing environment is likely to be pretty strong, given the supply pullback that we expect to start to see happening late in '24 and '25. So we would anticipate that these will be some very attractive investments that we could potentially start later this year and would reconcile very nicely to even where our current cost of capital is. So we certainly understand the metrics and the math on all this and pay close attention to it. We don't think we're going to ramp up a lot more than that at this point in the cycle, but we feel pretty good about the 4 opportunities that we're looking at, at the moment.Wesley Keith GolladayOkay. And then maybe if we can go to that topic of distress. I mean a lot of the private owners right now, do you feel that they may be upside down and the banks are just extending the opportunity right now? Or do they have significant equity, just need maybe a capital infusion?Adrian Bradley HillYes. I mean I don't think that we are seeing any distress in the market right now. I mean the projects, just like our portfolio, the operating fundamentals are very strong. So even on some of these lease-ups, when they underwrote them in 2021 or so, the leasing fundamentals are going to be a lot stronger than what they expected. And even the joint venture projects that we started in 2021, cap rates were in the 5%, 5.5% range on the valuation. I mean that's kind of where we are. So I would say that the developers have been somewhat disciplined in their underwriting in the last couple of years and the operating fundamentals are outperforming. So they won't get the pricing that they could have gotten 1.5 years ago, but there's still profit in a lot of these projects, so we're not seeing that yet. Where I think the distress could come are projects that closed a year, 1.5 years ago, and they did some type of financing cap or something that's coming due, and it's going to require a reset of -- or a pay down in order to get that loan rightsized and the debt service coverage rightsized. Those are going to be the ones, I think, that are going to have a little bit of trouble.OperatorAnd we will go next to Eric Wolfe with Citi.Eric WolfeJust to follow up to your answer there a moment ago. You mentioned your balance sheet is just in incredible shape. I don't think I've -- can remember seeing an apartment company at sort of mid-3x leverage down to probably low 3x later this year. So my question is really sort of what would it take, what type of opportunity would you need to see before you'd be willing to take your leverage back up to a more normal sort of 5x amount? And I guess if a portfolio came across that was like in, say, the 5.5% to 6% range, would that be interesting enough to allow you to take your leverage back up?H. Eric BoltonWell, Eric, this is -- I'll start, and Al, you can jump in. But we do anticipate that over the course of the next year or 2, that we will see leverage probably edge back up just a little bit, believing that we will -- if nothing else, we've got some development funding that we'll do. And of course, the funding that we're doing on our redevelopment work and repositioning work is super -- very, very accretive. And so we will begin to see leverage move a little bit back up. But having said that, we just think right now, given the uncertainty in the broader capital markets landscape and what we imagine to be likely an opportunity for more distressed asset buying, that capacity right now is a good thing to have. And so we're going to hold on to that. And I do think that, obviously, if we did see some larger opportunity come across that we felt made sense for us strategically and felt like we could do something closer to 5.5% to 6% range from a cap rate perspective, that probably would certainly get our attention. And obviously, it depends on a lot of different other variables. But we like where the balance sheet is right now given the broader landscape that we have with the capital markets and the transaction market. And so we're going to be very cautious in how we put that capacity to work. We've got some known needs that I've just mentioned that are very attractive investments and we'll continue to move forward with those. We don't have any, certainly, need to go attract additional capital right now. And as Al alluded to, the debt portfolio is in terrific position, a lot of duration, and it's all 100% fixed. So we're going to sit tight with what we have at the moment, largely.Albert M. CampbellI'll just add just quickly that, Eric, that's a very good point you make that really our target -- long-term target is closer to 4.5x to 5x on the EBITDA coverage. I mean we're providing opportunity right now, as Eric mentioned, and hopefully they will find those, expect to be able to find those. And long term, our target is in line with what you mentioned.Eric WolfeAnd then just on a related guidance question. You did 3.9% in terms of blended spread first quarter. It sounds like you expect to accelerate through the balance of the peak leasing season. So my question is really just how did it get down to that 3% blend that's in your guidance? Is it just a steep dropoff later this year or just some conservative baked in there?Albert M. CampbellI'm going to start with it and Tim can give some more details. What I would say primarily is, one, we need to see the bulk of leasing season happen as it comes. So we're providing opportunity to see that and get more information. We're encouraged certainly by what we saw in the first quarter. And I think secondly, the biggest point would be we do expect to see that seasonality in the most acute, if you would, in the fourth quarter. That's typically what it is in a normal year. That's sort of what we're expecting. So we could see that new lease pricing be a little more negative in that fourth quarter because the holiday season and demand just really shuts down in that period. So that's what we provided for in our forecast, I think, at this point.Timothy P. ArgoYes, Eric, this is Tim. I mean I think it will kind of boil down to new lease pricing that we see over the late spring and summer will be the ball game in terms of whether it ends up a little better than we thought or a little worse. You have, obviously, the bulk of the leases happening during that period. And they carry for several months throughout the year. So they have certainly an outsized impact. So if those new lease rates accelerate more, then it probably is a little better than we thought. If they accelerate not quite as much, probably a little less because renewals are going to be relatively consistent through the rest of the year.OperatorWe will go next to Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo.James Colin FeldmanI want to go back to your comments about 11% of leases written in the first quarter were new people moving into Sunbelt. Can you provide more color on that data point across the different markets? And I guess I'm thinking more about maybe some of the larger MSAs versus the smaller MSAs.Timothy P. ArgoYes, this is Tim. So 11% overall and probably markets you would expect. In terms of in-migration, Phoenix is our top market. You have about 18% of move-ins out of the market going into Phoenix. Tampa was another big one at 15%. Charlotte was 13%. Charleston and Savannah were pretty high in there as well. And so those are the biggest drivers. And that's been pretty consistent throughout the last several quarters as the ones that are benefiting the most.James Colin FeldmanInteresting. And then, I guess, similarly, if you think about the lay-up activity, I guess those are also the markets where you've seen the most growth in tech jobs or jobs that might be most at risk. Can you talk at all about how lay-up activity might be impacting the different types of MSAs and even (inaudible) specifically? Just trying to kind of think through the next 12 months or so.Timothy P. ArgoYes. I mean, we haven't seen a ton of impact yet. I mean I think certainly the technology sector is getting a lot of publicity and a lot of -- there's layoffs out there, but I do think a lot of the other sectors are still in the net hiring position. Austin's one, particularly in North Austin, where we've seen a little bit of impact from that, some of the tech jobs up in North Austin, but at the same time, you've got Tesla still planning to expand over the next couple of years there. You've got Oracle moving their headquarters there. So certainly long term in Austin, it's a job machine, and we feel really good about that. Outside of that, we haven't seen a lot. Phoenix, been tight a little bit. But again, we've got properties there, with it's a huge semiconductor plant coming in right there in one of our properties. So there's a little bit of short-term pressure over the next few quarters, but long term feel really good about all of those markets.James Colin FeldmanOkay. And then I know you talked about insurance and taxes on the expense side. Just as we think about your guidance for the year, any other variables or line items on the expense side that maybe you don't feel quite as confident -- or maybe there could be some changes there? I know you got your insurance coming up in July, your renewal.Albert M. CampbellThose are the 2 big items. I mean I think that expense -- the key components of expenses for the year are personnel, repair and maintenance, taxes and insurance. I think we -- the first 2, we expect to moderate as the year progresses as we talked about, and taxes and insurance remaining the biggest items that have the most unknown at this point. So that's ones we're keeping our eye on at this point.OperatorAnd we will take our next question from Linda Tsai with Jefferies.Linda TsaiMaybe just as a short follow-up to that last question. In terms of rationale for move-out job transfers and buying a new home, has the balance of these reasons shifted since 4Q and any regional trends you'd highlight?Timothy P. ArgoI mean it's pretty consistent. One, we've seen move-outs to buy a house has dropped dramatically. As you would expect with what interest rates have done, we've seen our move-outs due to rent increase drop quite a bit as well. The biggest reason for move-outs, which is always consistently our largest [read to put in our guide], is just a change in the job and job transfers and that's up a little bit. But it's -- as we've talked to people out on site, it's more just people moving for another job as opposed to any significant job losses. So turnover -- it's overall is down a little bit, but it's the -- some of the key reasons that we've talked about before and pretty, pretty consistent across markets, no matter if larger markets or secondary markets.OperatorAnd we have no further questions. I will return the call to MAA for closing remarks.H. Eric BoltonWell, no additional comments to add. So we appreciate everyone joining us, and I look forward to seeing everyone at NAREIT. Thank you.OperatorThis concludes today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.]"

In that same time, the Finance sector gained 3.14%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 2.19%.Investors will be hoping for strength from Cigna as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be May 5, 2023. The company is expected to report EPS of $5.35, down 10.98% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $45.36 billion, up 2.84% from the prior-year quarter.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $24.78 per share and revenue of $187.58 billion. These totals would mark changes of +6.49% and +3.84%, respectively, from last year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Cigna.

Price and EPS SurpriseLogitech International S.A. price-eps-surprise | Logitech International S.A. QuoteFactors to ConsiderLogitech’s fiscal fourth-quarter earnings are likely to have been negatively impacted by the declining demand for personal computers (PCs), the main sales booster for its PC peripheral products. Per the latest International Data Corporation report, worldwide PC shipments declined 29% year over year to 56.9 million units in the first quarter of 2023.In 2020 and 2021, Logitech benefited from the elevated demand for its video collaboration, keyboards &amp; combos and pointing device tools, mainly driven by the heightening of work-from-home and learn-from-home trends. Additionally, the demand for gaming products shot up due to the growing popularity of online video games and eSports amid the stay-at-home scenario. However, the demand softened due to the reopening of economic and business activities.The company witnessed a significant sales decline across all its product offerings in the last reported quarter. In the previous quarter, revenues from the Pointing Devices, PC Webcams, Tablet and Other Accessories, Audio &amp; Wearables, Keyboards &amp; Combos, Video Collaboration, Mobile Speakers and Gaming product categories plunged 13.8%, 49.2%, 21.4%, 33.7%, 21.9%, 21.2%, 32.5% and 16.5%, respectively.Story continuesAdditionally, enterprises are postponing their large IT spending plans due to a weakening global economy amid ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical issues. This may have hurt Logitech’s overall financial performance in the fiscal fourth quarter.However, reduced operating expenses are likely to have partially offset the negative impacts of the aforementioned factors on profitability.What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for LOGI this season.

276,04252f47-614e-3951-a00f-964076ff4892,TEL,2023-04-28,"At US$120, Is TE Connectivity Ltd. (NYSE:TEL) Worth Looking At Closely?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-120-te-connectivity-ltd-125455880.html,1682600095,STORY,['TEL'],"[TE Connectivity Ltd. (NYSE:TEL) received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$135 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$120. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether TE Connectivity's current trading price of US$120 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at TE Connectivity’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for TE Connectivity What's The Opportunity In TE Connectivity?According to my valuation model, TE Connectivity seems to be fairly priced at around 8.88% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy TE Connectivity today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $110.40, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because TE Connectivity’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.Can We Expect Decent Returns From TE Connectivity?peWhat kind of returns can we expect from TE Connectivity in the future? It’s one thing to get a stock at a low price, but the quality of the company is even more important, as its stock may be cheap or expensive for a reason. We can determine the quality of a stock many ways; one way is to look at how much return it generates relative to the money we’ve invested in the stock. TE Connectivity is expected to return 20% of your investment in the next couple of years if you buy the stock today. This is a solid return on your investment which builds up the case for owning the stock.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in TEL’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? And will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on TEL for a while, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for TEL, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Diving deeper into the forecasts for TE Connectivity mentioned earlier will help you understand how analysts view the stock going forward.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Northrop Grumman is off to a solid start to the year. Our team is driving industry-leading growth by executing our strategy, meeting the growing global demand from our customers and performing on our programs. As a result, we increased sales by 6% and delivered strong earnings per share in the quarter. Additionally, we're delivering on our capital deployment strategy, which prioritizes investing in our business and returning cash to shareholders. In the first quarter, we continued thoughtful investments in the capability and capacity needed to support our customers' operational initiatives, and we initiated a $500 million accelerated share repurchase plan, returning a total of nearly $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Based on first quarter results and our continued expectations for growth and strong operational performance, we're reaffirming our 2023 segment guidance. We're increasing our EPS guidance based on our continued confidence in our business outlook and to account for the divestiture of a small minority investment signed this week and expected to close this year. As we look to the long term, increasing breadth to freedom and security persist around the world. Given this, we expect continued support in Congress and the administration for the priorities outlined in the National Defense strategy, which align well with the Northrop Grumman portfolio solution. This support was reaffirmed in the administration's budget request, which was released in March. DoD investment accounts are up by nearly 4% for fiscal year 2024. Northrop Grumman programs continued to be well supported in the budget request, particularly in the areas of strategic deterrence, space, missile defense and advanced computing and communication technologies. The 2024 budget request also reflects the growing need for weapons capability and capacity, with overall funding increasing more than 20% compared to fiscal year 2023 and significant funding increases to major weapon programs, including many of which we provide key components. 2 of our franchise programs, GBSD and B-21, each fall total investment account funding increased by approximately 10%. The future year defense plan or also prioritizes these programs, with funding projected to nearly double from about $8 billion in fiscal year 2023 to $15 billion in 2028. Outside the U.S., the geopolitical landscape remains dynamic. Global defense budgets are increasing as many U.S. outlies modernize and expand their defense capabilities. An important part of our long-term growth strategy is focused on leveraging our portfolio to meet these growing global needs, and we continue to make progress in this area. In February, Australia issued a request for AARGM-ER, a high-speed, long-range air-to-ground missile that provides counter air defense capability. Northrop Grumman is a prime contractor for AARGM-ER. And this recent FMS request has a potential value of over $500 million. Australia is one of over a half dozen additional countries expressing interest in this capability. In addition, last month, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency approved the sale of 5 additional E-2D Hawkeye aircraft to Japan. These aircraft, along with the existing backlog, are expected to extend E-2D production well past mid-decade. These international opportunities, together with a broad set of others in IBCS, munitions and sensors, form a strong foundation to grow our international revenue at a double-digit rate over the next several years. With this global demand signal as a backdrop, we've been executing a strategy over the past few years to significantly enhance capabilities and capacity in our weapons portfolio. This portfolio includes components such as electronics, propulsion systems, warheads, infuses as well as missiles, armaments and interceptors. And as a result, we have multiple positions on key programs as both a supplier and a prime contractor. Let me share a few examples of progress we've made on this strategy. In the first quarter, we received awards for nearly $350 million for medium- and large-caliber ammunition, Bushmaster cannon and propulsion products for the guided multiple launch rocket system, or GMLRS. In addition, we're developing smarter, more advanced weapons required for future high-end fight with innovations in next-generation strike weapons, high-speed propulsion and smart ammunition. One example of this advancement is the Air Force's Stand-in Attack Weapon, also known as SiAW, a high-speed longer-range air-to-ground missile. During the first quarter, we received an award that takes us to the next phase of this competitive program. To meet our customers' growing demand in this area, we have invested nearly $1 billion since acquiring Orbital ATK, building our capacity for weapons and missile components. Our investments significantly increased capacity to produce solid rocket motors supporting our expectation for continued demand for this capability as well as increased capacity for GEM 63 boosters, which supports the growing launch needs of our civil and commercial customers. We're also investing to increase capacity in our missile integration facility located at the Allegheny Ballistics Laboratory in West Virginia. Our newest 113,000 square foot facility is a factory of the future. It is designed to support production of up to 600 strike missiles per year. Production operations will commence with the second lot of low rate initial production for AARGM-ER, adding to other programs that we currently support this complex, including GMLRS Hellfire and Precision Strike Missile, among several others. In addition, we're building a new hypersonic center of excellence in Elkton, Maryland. Later to open this summer, this new production facility is designed to provide full life cycle production for hypersonic weapons from design and development to production and integration using the latest digital engineering and smart manufacturing technologies. The Elkton facility supports programs like hypersonic attack cruise missile, known as and Air launched powered hypersonic weapon that we're producing in partnership with Raytheon Technologies. We're not only a provider of missile systems, we also are a leading provider of missile defense system. This is a rapidly growing area within our business and includes a diverse set of franchise programs. Our work in missile defense is now approaching 10% of company revenue, and we see an opportunity to expand that in the years ahead. Our broad end-to-end missile defense portfolio includes sensors, interceptors and command and control systems. One example is our prime contractor role on the next-generation Overhead Persistent Infrared, or OPIR Polar segment. This OPIR satellite constellation will operate at a highly elliptical orbit and provide critical strategic missile defense warning capabilities. Importantly, we also provide proliferated low earth orbit missile defense capabilities on programs like HBTSS and recent awards for SDA tracking Tranche 1. In addition, we're a prime integrator on next-generation INTERCEPT capabilities, including NGI and glide phase Interceptor. They protect against advanced ballistic and hypersonic missile threats. Shortly after the close of the quarter, we received approval for full rate production for IBCS, an integrated air and missile defense system. This key milestone allows the U.S. Army to set the fielding schedule for IBCS to its Air Defense unit, which will significantly bolster regional defense capabilities. Over the fighter period, domestic deliveries of IBCS units are expected to increase by 40%. And as a reminder, Poland selected IBCS to serve as the centerpiece of its air and missile defense modernization and a number of other allies are also evaluating the system. Before turning the call over to Dave, I'd like to touch on a couple of key program updates, starting with B-21. The program remains on the government's baseline for cost and schedule, and we're continuing to work towards first flight, which will be informed by events and data and remains on track for this year. There are no material changes in our EACs this quarter for the EMD phases of the program, and we continue to expect to receive the first LRIP award later this year. The B-21 program is expected to be the centerpiece of the Air Force's long-range strike portfolio for decades to come. With steady growth in the projected funding across the site, as I outlined, and strong customer demand for its unmatched range, health and survivability, the long-term outlook for the B-21 program remains robust. On GBSD, we achieved 2 key milestones in the quarter. This includes its first full-scale static test fire of the Stage 1 followed rocket motor and the successful completion of a series of wind tunnel tests, which tested the system in both subsonic and hypersonic environments. The comprehensive test campaign validated our digital modeling and simulations and improved design maturity of the missile. And earlier this month, the James Web-based telescope industry team led by Northrop Grumman won the prestigious trophy for revolutionizing the field of Aster physics. I want to congratulate the team for a pioneering design and unwavering commitment, which were instrumental in winning our industry's highest honor. Overall, our strong start to the year is a clear indicator of this team's performance. We see continued robust demand for our solutions in the U.S. and abroad, and we believe we're well positioned to maintain our industry-leading profitable growth and deliver value creation for shareholders and customers alike. With that said, I'll hand the call over to Dave to cover the details of our financial results and our outlook. Dave?David F. KefferOkay. Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. As Kathy noted, our first quarter results provide further evidence that our strategy is working. The strategic investments that we're making in franchise programs and key customer priority areas have positioned us to deliver differentiated growth. Our team continues to do an outstanding job of managing through challenges in the macroeconomic environment. We added substantially to our headcount again this quarter. With respect to the supply chain, we saw signs of modest progress in Q1. We continue to believe that our supply base will experience areas of pressure for some time. And inflation levels have begun to moderate but continue to have a higher base effect on our costs over time, especially on longer-term programs. As we've discussed on prior earnings calls, we've been experiencing impacts from inflation-related cost increases over the past year. We continue to drive efficiencies in our business and partner with our customers in an effort to reduce those impacts going forward. Now turning to Q1 results. Bookings of roughly $8 billion, were in line with our expectations, including $3.2 billion in restricted awards. Our backlog remains solid at more than 2x our annual sales, including nearly $24 billion in restricted backlog. At the segment level, our Q1 sales were particularly strong at Space Systems, which grew 17% year-over-year. Aeronautics sales were slightly below the projected full year run rate, primarily due to timing of volume on a few of our large programs. MS was up 3% in the quarter, driven by expansion in restricted sales in the Networked Information Solutions business. And Defense Systems sales were up 7%. It's Battle Management and Missile Systems business, several components of which Kathy described earlier, is experiencing particularly strong customer demand, given the global threat environment. Segment margins were 10.8% in Q1, in line with our expectations, and included roughly 50 basis points of unfavorable impact associated with higher CAS pension costs that were incorporated into our rates in Q1. Those impacts were spread relatively evenly across the 4 segments. AS margins were down from the first quarter of 2022, primarily because of the $67 million favorable EAC change on the B-21 EMD phase last year. GS margins were about in line with our full year outlook adjusting for the CAS pension impacts. MS was slightly under its 2023 projection, due in part to a loss recognized on an unconsolidated joint venture. And Space margins were solid in the quarter with lower EAC adjustments partially offset by the sale of a license to a customer. At the enterprise level, we generated sales volume of $9.3 billion, representing growth of 6% compared to the first quarter of 2022. Consistent with what we communicated last quarter, our Q1 sales were just over 24% of the midpoint of our full year estimate and were driven by both our hiring trends and supplier deliveries. Our first quarter operating income also grew 6%, due to lower corporate unallocated expense and intangible asset amortization. Our diluted earnings per share were $5.50 and included a headwind of over $1 per share compared to the first quarter of 2022 from lower net pension income. This noncash pension headwind will continue to be a factor in our year-over-year EPS comparisons throughout 2023. And based on current estimates, we expect pension income to begin to increase next year. We also had a few Q1 benefits below the segment line that contributed to our earnings per share. First, our other corporate unallocated expenses were only $4 million. And while our forecast for corporate unallocated was already weighted toward the second half of the year, this created a timing benefit of roughly $0.10 per share in the quarter. Our marketable securities were favorable in the period and contributed roughly $0.10 to earnings. And our Q1 estimated tax rate of 15.6%, was lower than our full year forecast, contributing another $0.10 of upside. This was due in part to the benefits of various tax credits recognized in the quarter. Altogether, these items contributed approximately $0.30 of benefit to our Q1 EPS, but they are primarily timing related in nature. Turning to cash. As is our typical pattern, we experienced an outflow of cash in the first quarter, due primarily to working capital timing. Capital expenditures totaled $309 million, and our first quarter operating cash flow was a usage of approximately $700 million, consistent with historical trends. Q2 last year was a period of cash outflow also, but we're currently forecasting a modest inflow in Q2 this year. In April, we made our first cash tax payment of the year, including the R&amp;D taxes owed associated with Section 174. For the full year, we're projecting over $700 million in cash taxes associated with Section 174, and we continue to be hopeful that Congress will find a way to amend or repeal the law. Moving to guidance. Given that the first quarter was roughly in line with our expectations, we have not changed any of our full year segment guidance ranges. We continue to project a book-to-bill ratio just under 1.0x for the year. We expect our second quarter sales to be in line with or slightly higher than Q1 and less than 25% of our full year estimate. We expect many of the timing items I mentioned previously to normalize over the course of the year, including interest expense. With respect to capital deployment, we remain committed to returning more than 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders this year via dividends and share repurchases. As Kathy mentioned, we initiated a $500 million accelerated share repurchase in the first quarter. And including our open market repurchases, we'll repurchase roughly $720 million of stock in the period. We also raised $2 billion in new notes in the first quarter at attractive rates, which we anticipate using in part to retire the $1 billion of notes that are maturing in Q3. Over the long term, we've demonstrated our ability to generate strong and stable cash flows in our underlying business. And based on the durable growth in several areas of our business that Kathy highlighted, we continue to expect our free cash flow to expand at a robust rate, not just through 2025, but through the second half of the decade as well, providing flexibility for our long-term capital deployment plans. And as we noted in our 10-Q this morning, we just signed an agreement to sell our minority equity investment in a small international business. Closing is expected to occur later this year, most likely in Q3, subject to government approvals and closing conditions. We have increased our EPS guidance by $0.40, consistent with our estimated gain from the transaction and additive to our strong business outlook. In conclusion, we're pleased with our start to the year, certain improvements in the macro environment and robust demand signals from our customers domestically and abroad. And with that, let's open up the call for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) The first question will come from Doug Harned of Bernstein. .Douglas Stuart HarnedI'd like to go back kind of to last quarter on the B-21. And the reason is, in the last quarter, you all raised the possibility that you could see the first 5 LRIPs not be profitable in a sense because of inflation. And one of my question is that presumably, when you originally won the contract back in 2015, you made inflation assumptions in the pricing that I would assume maybe LRIPs profitable. And since that time, we've seen mostly low inflation years with a couple of recent high inflation years just recently here. And first, how has inflation progressed relative to your original assumptions over that 8-year period? And is there an inflation level we should watch for going forward, where those costs become the issue that you were concerned about? Just trying to really see what the assumptions you're making are and how we should think about ultimate profitability here?Kathy J. WardenYes, Doug, thanks for the question. So to talk about the assumptions that we made then on inflation and even that we're making now, I would look to publicly available information. We tend to use indices to think about long-term projections on macroeconomic condition. So if you roll the clock back to 2015 and look at what the Fed was doing, they were managing inflation to a 2% target and doing that pretty effectively. So you can imagine that that's the set of assumptions that we would have been relying on as we looked out into the future. I'm not saying that's exactly what we did. We're not going to disclose that, but those indices give you a good sense of what we would have been thinking. Of course, the last couple of years, inflation has been higher than that. And the thing about inflation, particularly as it relates to labor, is it doesn't tend to come back down on labor once salaries are elevated, they tend to set a new labor benchmark. And so as we think about the future, we're expecting those costs at least to remain elevated over the remainder of the execution of the contract. In areas like materials and other supplies, we do believe those will follow the indices associated with those commodities. And so there will be some variation of what we can buy those materials out into the future and the indices are a good way to think about that as well.Douglas Stuart HarnedAnd so when you go forward to finalize each of these LRIPs, which is coming soon, I guess two things. I mean, is there -- is it possible to think -- for us to think of inflation levels that could be of a concern? But then also shouldn't you have the opportunity at least on labor and materials to get some sort of an equitable adjustment on cost?Kathy J. WardenWell, we certainly believe so. And as I noted in our last call, that is what we're working toward. And so we continue to have discussions with the government, both congressionally with the dollars that they have appropriated for inflation relief for contracts just like this and the Department of Defense as they think about how to allocate those funds, and we'll continue to work that very actively. And of course, wouldn't expect that relief to come all at once, but in the annual appropriations associated with the program or a separate funds like we saw in 2023 for inflation relief. Now with that said, we also are working to offset these increases with other elements inside of our control, our overhead rates, the other costs that flow into segment operating margin that can have a beneficial effect as well. We're not relying fully on actions the government will take, although we do believe that both the government and Northrop Grumman should be working to mitigate these impacts and share this risk together.OperatorOur next question will be coming from Seth Seifman of JPMorgan.Seth Michael SeifmanI wonder if you could talk a little bit about Aeronautics and kind of other than restricted programs. I assume B-21, we saw a number of declines in the quarter. And that's not very surprising. Those are kind of mature programs. But where do you see, excluding B-21, where we have the budget documents, when do you see the rest of the Aeronautics portfolio sort of stabilizing? And then if you could talk about the potential for any other growth drivers in the portfolio, especially potentially in the Autonomous area over time and how you're thinking about aligning with the Air Force's strategy there?Kathy J. WardenWell, thanks, Seth. We have talked about the long-term view of Aero top line. And so while not guiding for 2024, we have said that we do expect revenue to be flattish this year and then begin to grow again next. And that's driven by a few factors. The first is those programs you noted and that we noted in the Q, like Joint Stars, Global Hawk that have been putting pressure on our year-over-year comparison, Aero do become minimal from this point forward in terms of year-over-year sales decline. We also have programs that are fairly stable, like F-35, that will continue. And then we have growth drivers like B-21. And in addition to that, I would add the Air Force's operational imperatives as well as some new program activity that's happening for the Navy and Aviation as well. So all of those create modest but some upside for us as we look in the compares '24 to '23.Seth Michael SeifmanGreat. I guess if I could sneak in one more. You talked a lot about the investments that you're making in your prepared remarks, and I thought that was very helpful. And I kind of plays into this idea that we're in sort of a different world where the customer needs kind of more spare capacity. How do you think about return on investment in that world where maybe there's a need for more spare capacity? And is there a willingness on the customer side to kind of recognize that and provide some value for it as well?Kathy J. WardenYes. Excellent question as well. So as we're thinking about the investments we're making, we look at what we believe a stable long-term capacity level is that will be supported by government expenditures. And we've made those investments. We got ahead of that curve because we believe that we can gain share by being ready for that demand signal as it comes. But then we look out and say there is likely to be a period of surge that the government would like industry to respond to. And there, we've put proposals forward to the government to get their funding to support what would be that additional capacity. So in the example that I gave today, I talked about us investing nearly $1 billion of our own dollars in expanding solid rocket motors, both for tactical missiles, which was really the focus of my commentary today, but all the way to strategic missiles as well. We're expanding capacity in those areas. We have more than doubled the capacity with the investments we've laid in or plan to make. For the government to go even further than that, we are suggesting that we can support that, but would look for government funding to complement it.OperatorOur next question will come from Sheila Kahyaoglu of Jefferies.Sheila Karin KahyaogluKathy, you mentioned GBSD and B-21 funding nearly doubling through the bid up. How do we think about this relative to your plan as it relates to Northrop's revenues versus some of the money, obviously, going to suppliers or the government? And you also mentioned free cash flow growth beyond the current target. How do we think these programs contribute to that growth?Kathy J. WardenSo as we look at the profile on large programs like B-21 and Sentinel. You are right point out that all of that doesn't come to Northrop Grumman and our suppliers. Some of that is government funding. And that's particularly true with the Sentinel program because there is a significant of government activities associated with the work that will go on in the missile field and the coordination and collaboration across government to enable the construction scope. So when we look at our profile on these programs, it is a subset of the overall budget growth, but it tends to follow in terms of relative year-over-year growth. What we will experience, not necessarily in that year because those appropriated funds or for what will be extended, it then takes us time to extend those funds, sometimes 18 to 24 months depending on the scope of work kind of program like B-21 and Sentinel. So when you net all of what I just said, the signal from the budget tells you there is continued and sustained growth in both of those programs through the that, that growth will come and be sustained not just through that 2028 period if you could expect it to continue, both when you look at what the government has said about quantities on B-21 and how they ramp as well as Sentinel moving into production in that time frame and still be ramping. So it's not just about '24 to '28 projections that you see in the Fidelis, but looking beyond that into the next decade.David F. KefferSheila, one thing I'd add to the second point you raised around free cash flow growth, what we were touching on there is really beyond the 3-year outlook period that we've provided with specifics. The second half of the decade provides an opportunity for continued free cash flow growth, and that's driven by returns on some of the investments Kathy has been describing throughout this call. It will be a period of less heavy capital intensity and more in the way of opportunity for returns on those investments we have been and are currently making. And then, of course, some of the less operational items like cash taxes will be lower in the second half of the decade as we get through the Section 174 amortization period. And the opportunity exists for CAS pension recoveries to continue to be higher in that second half of the decade. So all told, that's what gives us optimism about that period from a free cash flow expansion perspective also.OperatorThe next question will be coming from Ronald Epstein of Bank of America.Ronald Jay EpsteinMaybe changing gears just a little bit. Kathy, can you talk a bit about -- and you mentioned it a little bit in your opening remarks about Northrop's strategy in the space market. One of the big things that we learned out as the space imposing, the whole architecture of space is changing. You guys had a huge presence there, and there's some pretty interesting stuff going on with your partnership with Firefly and so on and so forth. But if you could just kind of walk us through your vision on Northrop in space, defense and commercial?Kathy J. WardenYes, certainly. So you're right to point out that our strategy in space is broad-based. The cornerstone of it is as the cornerstone of our business tied to national security and supporting the U.S. and our allies to operate effectively and freely in space. But we also have a strategic significant pillar in space exploration as evidenced in our work in James Webb and more scientific missions, but also our work in the Artemis program in space exploration. And our commercial ventures are largely tied to enabling those 2 strategic pillars within our space business. So when we are looking at the technologies that we need in space, we are well integrated across all elements of a solution, meaning we think about launch, even if we're not the launch provider, having partnerships with companies that can provide us the ability to launch. And that's the relationship we have with Firefly, being able to build the satellites that provide value and that's both being a bus provider as well as the payload, then being able to operate, command and control those assets in space. So that's more of a JADC2 contribution with the space domain in mind. And then, of course, that means being able to operate on the ground as well as be able to have these satellites able to communicate and share data. So this ties to the core competencies we have across this company in other domains, and we are working to bring all of that to the space domain. And the space domain is the fastest growing area, not only of our business, but our customers' budget, both NASA and the Department of Defense has been very well supported in recent budgets, and we expect that to continue. So our objective is to use this opportunity to continue to grow our share and our relevance in those markets.Ronald Jay EpsteinAnd then if I may ask just a quick follow-on to that. When you think about the growth in that business, it's been a huge growth driver for you. Do you foresee that continuing into the next couple of years? I mean, how should we think about the growth of that business?Kathy J. WardenI do. And I've said that we shouldn't get wedded to double-digit growth that we've been experiencing consistently for the last several years because we have been in a position of winning significant new programs and seeing those programs ramp. And the business itself has nearly doubled. It's pretty amazing to see what's happened in the last few years. So I don't expect that to be the growth profile for the next several years, but I do expect it to continue to be a growth engine in our company. And as we just talked about programs like Sentinel, the most significant growth on some of these is yet to come because many of the programs are in the development phase, where we are just building the first of. The opportunity is when those transition into production for both higher volumes and higher margins. And that's still very much ahead of us.OperatorThe next question will be coming from Robert Spingarn of Melius.Robert Michael SpingarnSo Kathy, just a follow-up on Ron's question on space. SpaceX announced a separate division called Star Shield that's going to be focused on defense work. How do you think about their push into national security? And is there an opportunity actually to partner with them? So is it more of a positive potentially or negative?Kathy J. WardenI don't see it as a significant change. We have been partnering with SpaceX. We expect to continue to do so. And my sense is that standing up this into within SpaceX, it's more to help them with the structural differences in dealing with the government work and customers versus their commercial aspirations. But in terms of our ability to work together, they've been a good partner to us. Of course, they're also a competitor, but that's normal in our space, and so we expect that to continue. And we embrace competition in Northrop Grumman. We think it hones our skills makes us stronger. And so we see this as a positive for the industry overall.OperatorThe next question will be coming from Jason Gursky of Citi.Jason Michael GurskyKathy, you did a nice job of outlining some of the recent wins and developments and investments that you're making. You touched a little bit about Aeronautics and Space growth in the out years. So I wonder if you might do the same for Defense and the Mission Systems kind of focusing in not just on the positives but any potential headwinds that you see there, so we can all kind of get a good sense of what out your growth rates in '24 and '25 might look like?Kathy J. WardenYes. So why don't I start with Mission Systems. It's been a steady grower. We anticipate that it will continue to be. It hasn't been our fastest grower, but it's just really consistent. And I expect that to be the position Mission Systems finds itself and going forward. And that's not to say there aren't a lot of changes happening within that business. It is a highly competitive business and one where technical differentiation is critical, but they are staying at the forefront of technology to remain competitive. So some examples of that are as aircraft of the fourth gen are retired eventually, they have roles -- significant roles on some of those. And so that work starts to dissipate. But at the same time, they are competing for next-generation technologies. And you see this even playing out on the F-35, where we talked about the new radar development award that we got is that platform is being modernized with Block IV upgrades. And so I'm really pleased with that team's competitive position stay at the forefront of technology and continue to win new work, but that will be necessary for them to continue this mid-single-digit growth rate that we've got become accustomed to there. In terms of Defense, it's a little bit of a different story. There, we have been a flattish business, and that has been because we weren't seeing significant growth in weapons. It was a pretty stable business, and we were seeing the work in our aircraft modernization decline. What I expect to see going forward is that our weapons portfolio growth more than offset the declines in the other part of the portfolio, and it will be a net grower for us. How much is dependent on how quickly that global demand that I talked about in today's call matures and also how successful we are in winning work on both new weapons development programs as well as second source on some existing programs. And I'm optimistic there. But this year will be really pivotal in indicating what we think the growth for that business will be. But we do see it being a growth business next year.OperatorThe next question will be coming from Kristine Liwag Morgan Stanley.Kristine Tan LiwagWith the debt ceiling standoff, there's been a lot of discussion of an extended CR in fiscal year '24, which tend to have more of a disruptive impact on programs that are ramping or transitioning. You've previously mentioned that you expect the first B-21 LRIP contract later this year as it transitions from development. But if the program award date slips past the end of September and into fiscal year '24, what could that mean for the program?Kathy J. WardenFor the B-21, because those funds were appropriated as part of FY '23, we don't believe that there will be an issue with them awarding that production lot. And as you look across our portfolio, we are used to navigating CRs. And so there aren't any major issues that I would point out to you if this is a short-term CR. But as the industry always points out, the longer a CR goes, the more those risks become material. I'm hopeful that, given the threat environment that Congress recognizes the importance of timely appropriations, I'm not saying we won't have a CR, but I am hopeful that it won't be an extended period CR. But if indeed that's the case, we'll work with the government to address any issues that we see on individual and material program.OperatorThe next question comes from Myles Walton of Wolfe.Myles Alexander WaltonDave, I wonder if you could first size the loss of the JV and the favorable license in relative terms or absolute terms you like? And then maybe, Kathy, at a high level, I think this is the high watermark thus far for cost-plus mix, 54% in the quarter since the Orbital acquisition was done. And I'm curious if it keeps going higher from here or this truly is a high watermark?David F. KefferWell, why don't I start on the first, and then I'll hand it over to Kathy. On your first question, we talked on the call about last year's $67 million EAC benefit on the B-21 EMD program in this quarter. When things get to that level of magnitude, well into the tens of millions, we tend to disclose and describe and quantify those in more detail. When we have things in the $10 millions and $20 millions, as we do every quarter, as you'd imagine a business of our size, we tend to group those together and describe them as we have in this case, the benefit of the license sale and the downside from the JV. So you can expect things like that to have been in that much lower range, but still meaningful in terms of thinking through run rates and full year impacts.Kathy J. WardenAnd Myles, I'll just add on to that before I answer your second question that if you look at our margins coming out of the gate for the year right where we wanted to be in segment operating margin adjusted for the pension impact, which we've been talking about, hitting the programs in the first quarter. So we're not breaking that down by segment. If you took each of our 4 businesses and then accounted for those 2 minor exceptions, which you just outlined and adjusted for pension, they be right in line with our guidance for the year. So we're not going to walk you through the exact math of each item that goes into that, that we can tell you that those segments all 4 are in the first quarter with those impacts we've outlined adjusted for right in line with where they need to be to deliver on their guidance. In answer to your second question, I do believe the quarter is a bit of a high watermark on our mix because we had some fluctuations just in production quantities within particularly MS that drove their mix balance higher on cost plus. We don't even expect that to sustain for the full year within MS. So we're going to probably end the year a little over the 50% cost plus, which is where we had signaled we would likely be, and that's still where we think we are. And we don't see a major shift in that for the next couple of years until, as we've said, these programs that are in development start to move into production, especially the bigger ones like B-21, Sentinel and some of the space programs, then you'll see a more material mix shift for us, but it will be towards fixed price.OperatorThe next question will be coming from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen.Cai von RumohrTerrific. So Kathy, you mentioned that book-to-bill expected to be a little bit under 1x this year. But lots of times, key wins have small bookings to start off. So could you give us some color in terms of what are the key competitions or booking opportunities you see over the rest of the year? And what are the milestones we should look for?Kathy J. WardenYes. So it's a very intuitive question. As we look at 2023, there are not many competitive new awards or even down select. As I've talked about, we have a good bit of work in our portfolio where we are in a usually 2-horse race programs like NGI is a good example of that. But we don't see many of those this year. They become more substantive in '24 and even '25. And -- so we'll provide more color on those as we guide for '24 later this year. What I'll tell you about 2023 is that the majority of our sales this year are in backlog, and we don't see much in the way of competitive new awards. It's really immaterial for us this year.OperatorThe next question is from Robert Stallard of Vertical.Robert Alan StallardKathy, one for you. The Australian government put out a defense strategy report, I think it was earlier this week. And in there, they seem to be contemplated whether they thought they might buy the B-21, which is a bit of a surprise to me at least. I was wondering this might be a sign that the U.S. government is a little bit more open to the U.S. defense industry exporting some of its more sophisticated equipment, including Northrop Grumman?Kathy J. WardenYes, I'm glad you took the question the way you did. I was obviously expecting someone might ask, why didn't they buy it? And you're right on. It would be premature for the U.S. to be working with another government on the B-21 program. But I think it is important that there were discussions ongoing ones that if you would have told me a handful of years ago might happen, I would have been surprised to hear. So I think in particular, and the opening of a strategic relationship on nuclear-powered submarines between the U.S., the U.K. and Australia is going to change how those 3 nations at least work together more collaboratively, and I wouldn't take it off the table in the long run that other strategic capabilities become part of that dialogue. But with where the B-21 is today, I think it appropriate that they did not count on it in their defense strategic review.OperatorThe next question is coming from Ken Herbert of RBC.Kenneth George HerbertYour acquisition of Orbital ATK, the timing in hindsight now seems to have been very good, just considering growth in Space and now what we're seeing in Missiles and Munitions. Within the broader sort of capital allocation context, are there other areas perhaps from an inorganic standpoint or acquisition standpoint that you think could fit in well with the portfolio? You obviously outlined a number of organic investments today. But how do you view acquisitions perhaps moving forward relative to the market opportunities? And at what point would you maybe look more favorably on inorganic growth?Kathy J. WardenWe certainly remain active in looking at opportunities to expand through acquisition. I would say that on the breadth of our portfolio and the strength of it, there are no gaps that I see an imperative to use acquisitions to fill those gaps that we are positioned to do so largely through both organic investing and external partnering, which is an important tool in our toolkit. It doesn't require acquiring companies to have those very strategic partnerships with them, one of which we talked about earlier in the call with Firefly, for instance. But with that said, the regulatory environment is certainly top of mind when I think about execution risk associated with acquisition as well. So we take all of that into consideration and likely wouldn't see a path to do a significant strategic acquisition in the near term.OperatorThe next question is coming from David Strauss of Barclays.David Egon StraussKathy, you mentioned the updated funding profile for B-21 and Sentinel that were in the budget. Specifically, I wanted to ask about B-21. It looks like there was some shift there where development dollars were added and production dollars were shifted to the right. So if you could comment on what that reflects, first of all? And second of all, what that could mean for your margin profile in the program, given your strong performance during the development phase?Kathy J. WardenYes, David. So you may recall, we had talked previously about our cost projections for the program were below independent cost estimates upon which the government needed to set their budget. You're starting to see that now reflected in the modifying those production budget. And you might see more of that in the future as we're hitting those cost targets that we have for the programs that are below their independent cost estimates. So that's what you see happening in production. The production funding they requested really supports the needs of the program as we and the government understand them today that is allowing them to ask Congress for more in the RDT&amp;E accounts associated with modernization and beginning that modernization now. And I really want to complement the way the Air Force manage this programs. They are always thinking ahead and working with us on not just the current spaces we're executing but how we will execute the next phase of the program. So we have largely moved our way through EMD. Now we're starting production. We -- it's only natural that we would be looking at the modernization program, and that's what you see reflected in their budgeting. And from a margin perspective, I know, which is really where you want to go, yes, we do expect the margins on that work associated with modernization to be better than what we expect to get in LRIP production, so it will be a net positive to the overall B-21 margin picture.Todd B. ErnstWe have time for one more question.OperatorThe next question and final question is coming from Peter Arment of Baird.Peter J. ArmentKathy, just circling back to kind of how you kicked off the call talking about kind of increased demand signals on Munitions and some of the Missile Defense capabilities like IBCS. Just when we think about international, how do you think a lot of this growth starts to layer in? Is it more '24, '25 or in beyond? Or do you see some of this growth actually showing up more to the left of that?Kathy J. WardenYes. We see some of it starting to show up now. So I mentioned $350 million of awards that we received in the first quarter associated with weapons. And of course, IBCS, part of the Missile Defense portfolio, we are starting as that now has gotten full rate production approval to see that demand fill out not just here, but with the Poland deliveries as well. So some of that certainly is going to provide support to the Defense System sector in 2023. But we do see the majority of those opportunities later, '24, '25, as those programs scale. NGI is another good example where we have seen significant growth last year in this. We'll see somewhere into 2024, but the real opportunity there is after either a down select or a carry forward of 2 parties and moving into production in the later part of the decade.So thanks, everybody, for joining our call today. I also want to again extend my thanks and congratulations to our team for another solid quarter. We look forward to speaking with you all on our next earnings call in July. So Lisa, with that, we're concluding today's call.OperatorThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's call, and you all may disconnect.]"

EPS came in at $5.50, compared to $6.10 in the year-ago quarter.The reported revenue compares to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.2 billion, representing a surprise of +1.09%. The company delivered an EPS surprise of +6.59%, with the consensus EPS estimate being $5.16.While investors scrutinize revenue and earnings changes year-over-year and how they compare with Wall Street expectations to determine their next move, some key metrics always offer a more accurate picture of a company's financial health.As these metrics influence top- and bottom-line performance, comparing them to the year-ago numbers and what analysts estimated helps investors project a stock's price performance more accurately.Here is how Northrop Grumman performed in the just reported quarter in terms of the metrics most widely monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts:Revenue- Mission Systems: $2.56 billion compared to the $2.62 billion average estimate based on four analysts. The reported number represents a change of +2.6% year over year.Revenue- Aeronautics Systems: $2.52 billion compared to the $2.63 billion average estimate based on four analysts.

As Wall Street debates the cause of First Republic’s (FRC) troubles, one analyst blames the nation’s top financial regulators. Fed Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen were “advocates of the strategy called ‘go big at the Fed’,” Chris Whalen, Whalen Global Advisors Chairman tells Yahoo Finance.“After 2018…we had a big problem in the money markets, so I think Chairman Powell…panicked in Washington, and they decided to provide more reserves.”As the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the central bank acted again, bringing the Fed’s balance sheet to nearly $9 trillion. “What they did, in essence, was throw a lot of money at a perceived problem, but they’ve created a real problem now, which is that interest rates have risen,” Whalen says.""The Fed has created a huge market risk, so these outliers like Silicon Valley, First Republic, have tipped over in a difficult funding market.”In his full interview, Whalen spoke with Brad Smith and Julie Hyman about the issues First Republic (FRC) is facing.Key Video Moments00:00:05: Powell and Yellen's strategy00:01:10: Huge market risk00:01:35: Unrealized losses on balance sheetsVideo Transcript- Why is it Jay and Secretary Yellen's fault?CHRIS WHALEN: Well, particularly, Chairman Powell, but also, I think, Secretary Yellen, were advocates of a strategy that's called go big at the Fed. After 2018, you recall at the end of the year, we had a big problem in the money markets. And so I think Chairman Powell and some of his colleagues panicked in Washington, and they decided to provide more reserves. They did so in 2019. And then we had COVID, and they even went bigger.And they expanded the Fed's balance sheet to almost $9 trillion. So what they did, in essence, was throw a lot of money at a perceived problem, but they've created a real problem now, which is that interest rates have risen. All the paper that was originated in 2020 and '21 is now trading 15, 20 points below the price where it was issued. And the banks are facing huge losses. Also other investors-- bond investors, REITs, all sorts of people that own these high-quality triple-A rated securities-- we're talking about treasuries, Ginnies, Fannies, Freddies, right-- which are supposed to be low-risk, but the Fed has created huge market risk. And so these outliers, like Silicon Valley, First Republic, have tipped over in a difficult funding market. And even JP, even Bank of America, you can see how their cost of funds is rising. It's very rapidly year over year.Story continues- Their cost of funds is rising, Chris. Hey, it's Julie. It's good to see you.CHRIS WHALEN: Hey.- Their cost of funds is rising. However, the whole issue of unrealized losses sitting on their balance sheets, like that in and of itself, isn't that much less of an issue, if it isn't-- isn't it even almost a moot point at the biggest banks-- at everybody besides the banks that seem the most distressed? I mean, those banks don't have to do anything with that stuff, right?CHRIS WHALEN: No. You see, that's the issue. In a way, yes, it's an optics problem. So back at the end of the third quarter last year, it was horrible. It was almost a trillion dollars in market-to-market losses on available for sale, and also held to maturity securities. But the problem, Julie, is that we originated $25 trillion for the securities in '21 and '21, of all descriptions. That paper has very low cash flow. So if I'm holding Ginnie Mae II's and my cost of funds is now 5, I'm losing money. OK? And so the embedded cash flow loss is the problem.And that's why you've seen some banks actually taking assets to the curb, taking the loss on a 2% or 3% asset, right? So they can go by a 6% or a 7%. And the whole industry is going to have to do this, Julie. They have no choice.]"

The currency slid as much 3.4%, the yield on local peso bonds rose and dollar bonds extended declines for a second day. The cost to insure the nation’s debt against default rose, as did swaps.After some initial turbulence, the longer-term investor reaction will likely depend on whether the new minister, Ricardo Bonilla, can serve as a moderating force in the president’s administration.Ocampo, probably Colombia’s best-known economist, had a status that allowed him to repeatedly rein in more radical proposals from officials, including Petro himself, on everything from oil policy to capital controls.Time after time, Petro would float a controversial idea that caused bonds to drop until Ocampo walked it back. It’s less clear if Bonilla, who ran the city of Bogota’s finances from 2012 to 2015 while Petro was mayor, would take a similar approach.“Ocampo was known to the market and had a name to protect, which gave him certain independence from the president,” said Benito Berber, an economist at Natixis. “Bonilla seems less independent.”Ocampo’s respect for the central bank’s independence and the nation’s fiscal rule helped underpin Colombian asset prices in recent months, said Juan Pablo Espinosa, vice president of risk at Proteccion SA, one of the nation’s two largest private pension funds.In radio interviews Thursday morning, Bonilla vowed to maintain the bank’s independence and stick to the rule, which aims to reduce the budget deficit. He added that the oil-exporting nation doesn’t need more crude exploration contacts.Story continues“We are committed to maintaining economic stability, giving peace of mind to the market, and watching how the exchange rate behaves,” he said in one interview. “There will not be price controls.”Analysts from Wells Fargo and Natwest Markets are saying the weakness in Colombian markets Thursday is an opportunity to load up on the country’s assets.“The fact that the government’s congressional coalition has disintegrated should be seen as a positive for local assets, as it actually reduces the chances of significant policy shifts,” said Alvaro Vivanco, head of emerging-market strategy at NatWest Markets. “The policy trajectory is now much narrower whether Ocampo is there or not.”Several key groups in congress ordered their members not to back the government-proposed health reform initiative, in another blow for Petro this week.Bonilla is an economist who has taught at the National University in Bogota, among other institutions. He has also served on the board of natural gas distributor Grupo Energia Bogota SA, and most recently was head of the state development bank Findeter.His appointment was part of a wider shake-up of cabinet ministers by Petro, who took office in August. Other cabinet changes include the ministries of health, agriculture and transport. Energy Minister Irene Velez, whose anti-oil stance has alarmed some investors, will remain in her role.As mayor, Petro had a large turnover of staff in key positions, but he never fell out with Bonilla, suggesting that the pair have a close relationship. In his time as Bogota’s finance chief, Bonilla oversaw a drop in the city’s debt load, while Fitch Ratings praised the city’s “sound financial performance” and “conservative debt policy.”During last year’s presidential campaign, Bonilla said in an interview that Colombia needed to boost tax revenue to simultaneously fund social programs while cutting the fiscal deficit.Market SlumpThe selloff that started when Petro asked his cabinet to resign Tuesday night, continued on Thursday. Citigroup strategists downgraded their recommendation on the country’s dollar debt to neutral from overweight as Bonilla’s appointment is a sign “Petro is radicalizing,” strategists including Esteban Tamayo wrote in a note.“This is bad news for Colombian assets,” said Andres Pardo, a strategist at XP Investments. “Bonilla is much more aligned with Petro’s economic vision than with Ocampo’s.”Ocampo said he will stay in the role for a few more days. The central bank is set to hold its next policy meeting Friday, and the finance minister is a voting member of the board. Goldman Sachs economists are now expecting a 25 basis-point hike amid the “highly unsettled” political and policy backdrop.Petro has complained about the central bank’s interest rate increases in recent months. Ocampo repeatedly ignored the president’s wishes and voted for monetary tightening to curb a surge in inflation.--With assistance from Patricia Laya, Oscar Medina and Ezra Fieser.(Updates market moves in second paragraph, adds context starting on the 10th)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekA Tax Loophole Makes EV Leasing a No-Brainer in the USAt Charles Schwab, Being a Big Bank Has Become a Big ProblemGood Luck Paying for Those $10,000 Obesity Drugs Everyone’s Talking AboutMusk Bets the House of Tesla on Low Prices and Razor-Thin MarginsBiden Sparks a $2 Trillion Arms Race Over Chips, Green Subsidies©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance in the past, and go directly to read 5 Best May Dividend Stocks To Buy. Dividend stocks have been a popular investment option for decades, providing investors with a steady stream of income from the dividends paid out by companies. Growth investment outweighed dividend stocks historically, however, the onset of the pandemic of 2020 has made investors risk-averse and led to a renewed interest in dividend companies. Over the years, dividends accounted for between 40% to 50% of total return in the US equity market, with an even larger proportion in international markets.Companies in the S&amp;P 500 paid out a record $561 billion in dividends in 2022, up from $511.2 billion in 2021. Another reason for this tremendous growth was resilient corporate earnings and solid cash flow on corporate balance sheets. The trend is expected to continue this year as well, however, with the recent developments surrounding the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) fallout and the state of the economy, analysts now expect a modest growth in dividend payments in 2023.In the first quarter of 2023, cash dividends within the S&amp;P 500 set a record payment, growing by 0.9% from the previous quarter and by 7.9% from the same period last year, as reported by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. For the 12-month period that ended March 2023, the S&amp;P 500 dividends were up 10.1% from the prior-year period. Some of the best dividend stocks that are gaining investors’ attention include Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX).Dividend stocks also offer a short-term profit opportunity to investors. For this reason, investors often use a dividend capture strategy, which involves buying a stock just before the company pays its dividend and then selling the stock shortly after the dividend is paid.

As Schwab began the year as a 7.0% weight in the portfolio, this hurt as much as the wipeout at First Republic. The declines in First Republic and Schwab together cost us a full five percentage points of our capital. Other financial holdings M&amp;T Bank, Credit Acceptance and JP Morgan also lost value during the quarter.Moving to Schwab, there are some similarities with First Republic, but I feel pretty strongly that we’re going to be fine holding on to the stock.I sometimes describe Schwab as the Costco of financial services. Others liken it to the auto insurer Progressive: it has the lowest operating costs in a huge, commoditized industry. Schwab passes on most of the savings from its low cost structure to clients, creating loyalty and trust, which in turn builds its brand. But Schwab has, over many years, reduced fees in so many areas that today it may be overly dependent on the net interest margin it earns on cash swept into its bank…” (Click here to read the full text)6.

Based on the real-world results we’ve observed with PREVNAR 13, PREVNAR 20 has the potential to greatly reduce the substantial remaining burden of pneumococcal disease among U.S. infants and children and help protect them against this potentially serious disease.""The FDA’s decision is based on results from the Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trial programs for the pediatric indication for PREVNAR 20. Three core Phase 3 pediatric studies contributed to data on the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of PREVNAR 20, including previously announced positive, top-line results of the pivotal U.S. Phase 3 study (NCT04382326). Further positive data from a Proof-of-Concept Phase 2 study (NCT03512288) that assessed the safety and immunogenicity of PREVNAR 20 also supported the FDA’s decision.The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) is committed to taking action as soon as possible on new vaccines after FDA approval. The next regularly scheduled ACIP meeting is June 21-22, 2023.About 20-Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate (PREVNAR 20) Vaccine Regulatory ReviewThe FDA granted PREVNAR 20 Breakthrough Therapy Designation in August 2020 for the pediatric indication for invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). Breakthrough Therapy Designation is designed to expedite the development and review of drugs and vaccines that are intended to treat or prevent serious conditions and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug or vaccine may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint(s).3 Drugs and vaccines that receive Breakthrough Therapy Designation are eligible for all features of the FDA’s Fast Track designation, which may include more frequent communication with the FDA about the drug’s development plan and eligibility for Accelerated Approval and Priority Review, if relevant criteria are met.4In August 2022, Pfizer announced positive top-line results from its pivotal Phase 3 study in U.S. infants (NCT04382326) and, in January 2023, the U.S. FDA accepted for priority review a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for PREVNAR 20 for the prevention of IPD for the pediatric indication.Additional positive top-line results from Pfizer’s Phase 3 study (NCT04546425) in infants in the European Union were announced in September 2022. In November 2022, Pfizer submitted the 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine candidate pediatric indication to the European Medicines Agency (EMA).INDICATIONS FOR PREVNAR 20PREVNAR 20 is a vaccine approved for:the prevention of invasive disease caused by 20 Streptococcus pneumoniae strains (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 8, 9V, 10A, 11A, 12F, 14, 15B, 18C, 19A, 19F, 22F, 23F, and 33F) in individuals 6 weeks and older.the prevention of otitis media (middle ear infection) caused by 7 of the 20 strains in individuals 6 weeks through 5 years.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR PREVNAR 20PREVNAR 20 should not be given to anyone who has had a severe allergic reaction to any component of PREVNAR 20 or to diphtheria–toxoid-containing vaccine.Individuals with weakened immune systems may have a lower immune response.

299,f6ca7405-2a21-34b6-8832-0b042be3f636,FOXA,2023-04-28,Column: Latest Fox shareholder suit targets ex-GOP leader Paul Ryan for oversight failures,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/column-latest-fox-shareholder-suit-204535958.html,1682628335,STORY,['FOXA'],"[By Alison FrankelApril 27 (Reuters) - (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)Was Fox Corp director and former Republican vice-presidential candidate Paul Ryan the blameless Cassandra of the Fox board, warning of disaster from the network’s coverage of 2020 election fraud conspiracies only to be ignored?Or was Ryan so deeply invested in his relationship with Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch that he deliberately sat on his hands as Fox News repeatedly aired election fraud claims that Ryan believed to be false?The answer depends on which Fox shareholder complaint you are reading.The first lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court to accuse Fox directors and officers of breaching their duties by failing to oversee Fox News' reporting of false election fraud allegations was filed on April 11, even before Fox reached its landmark $787.5 million defamation settlement with Dominion Voting Systems Corp on April 18.In that complaint, plaintiffs' lawyers from Heyman Enerio Gattuso &amp; Hirzel and Gardy &amp; Notis explicitly carved Ryan out of their list of defendants because, in their view, he repeatedly told both Murdochs that Fox ought to be pushing back against calls by former President Donald Trump to overturn election results.Ryan “attempted to put an end to FOX’s reporting of false information about the 2020 Presidential election,” the April 11 filing said. “Thus, is not named as a defendant.”But a second Fox shareholder derivative complaint, newly unsealed on Wednesday, contends that Ryan is all the more culpable for the Fox board’s failure to oversee the network’s coverage because he knew Fox shows were airing baseless conspiracies theories. Ryan had ample power, as head of Fox's nominating and corporate governance committee, to call for action from his fellow Fox board members, the complaint alleged. Instead, shareholders said, he made a bad-faith decision to do nothing.“Ryan manifestly knew that the accusations were false,” the newly unsealed complaint alleges. “Yet he took no board action, either to stop the libel or to retract it or to put appropriate policies in place.”Story continuesIn the horns of a dilemma, the new complaint said, “Ryan chose sloth.”Ryan, who has served on the Fox board since March 2019, did not respond to an email I sent to him via Fox Corp or to a phone message I left at the private equity firm Solamere Capital, where he is a partner.The latest lawsuit, which also asserts claims against the rest of Fox’s directors and officers, ascribes a particular motive to Ryan: He knew that audience metrics were a factor in the compensation that would be awarded to Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch. So, according to the shareholder suit, he did nothing to stop Fox from appeasing its audience with election fraud reporting in order to keep the Murdochs happy. Otherwise, the suit alleges, Ryan might have made enemies of these kingmakers, dashing any remaining ambitions Ryan might have to run again for elected office.A Fox Corp spokesman did not respond to my email. In its settlement with Dominion, Fox acknowledged a judicial ruling that it reported dozens of false election fraud allegations about the company.Shareholder lawyer Kurt Heyman, whose first-filed complaint omits Ryan as a defendant, declined to comment. Plaintiffs' lawyer Samuel Closic of Prickett, Jones &amp; Elliott, who signed a follow-up complaint lambasting Ryan, also declined to comment.The shareholder derivative litigation against Fox officers and directors is still in early stages. At least one other complaint is expected to be filed, based on an April 19 heads-up letter that a group of prominent plaintiffs' firms sent to Vice Chancellor Travis Laster, who is overseeing the case. My reporting suggests additional shareholder firms are also likely to emerge with their own version of derivative claims against Fox’s directors and officers.Eventually, Laster will pick one set of lawyers to lead the litigation attempting to recoup money from Fox directors and officers for the cost of their alleged oversight failures. Even then, it’s likely that the case won’t be resolved until after the conclusion of a $2.7 billion defamation suit by voting tech company Smartmatic USA Corp.I’m focusing now on the divergent views of Ryan’s potential liability because one of the factors Laster will consider when he selects a slate of lawyers to run the case will be their liability theories, so it's notable that the two cases on file disagree so significantly about Ryan's role.They do not disagree, however, on what Ryan knew and said about the election fraud conspiracies promulgated by former President Trump and his supporters. Ryan believed the conspiracy theories were bunk. He said so publicly, according to a Politico article cited in the new shareholder complaint, at a Bank of America conference on Nov. 24, 2020, just weeks after the election was called for Joe Biden.Privately, according to discovery from the Dominion lawsuit that is cited in both shareholder complaints, Ryan began warning the Murdochs even before then to stop airing election fraud allegations from the president and his allies.Fox’s board members and senior executives gathered on Nov. 10, 2020, for a three-day session culminating in the annual shareholder meeting. Evidence from the Dominion case shows that even at that early date, Ryan had already expressed concern to the Murdochs about Fox coverage. Ryan testified in his Dominion deposition that board members discussed Trump efforts to undo the election at the November meeting.But Fox’s formal board minutes “contain no record of such discussion,” the newly unsealed complaint said. Ryan and the other directors, it alleged, knew Trump allies were already spreading conspiracy theories on Fox, “but faithlessly took no board action, not then and not ever.”Under Fox’s bylaws, the new complaint claims, Ryan could have teamed up with one other independent director to call for a special board meeting as the network continued to provide a platform for allegations that Ryan had renounced. He could have insisted that his corporate governance committee be appointed to monitor “unreliable” Fox hosts and guests, the complaint said. At the very least, shareholders said, Ryan’s committee could have assigned monitoring responsibility to a different board committee.Ryan’s failure to take any such actions, despite his own, public repudiation of election fraud conspiracy theories, puts him at “a heightened likelihood of liability,” according to the new complaint.Or not, according to the April 11 complaint.Someday we may know if Paul Ryan was an unsung hero or a faithless board member as Fox covered the aftermath of the 2020 election. Clearly, that day is not now.Read more:Fox shareholders are circling Rupert MurdochExclusive -- Fox investors seek records in possible step toward suing directors (Reporting By Alison Frankel; editing by Leigh Jones)]"
300,66f1f031-ebf1-310d-89a5-3c2cdd8142af,PYPL,2023-04-28,Apple Pay Later won't affect us for years: Klarna CEO,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/apple-pay-later-wont-affect-215601009.html,1682632561,VIDEO,"['AAPL', 'PYPL']","[Klarna’s CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski is not worried about competition with Apple. The tech giant introduced its buy now pay later offering, Apple Pay Later, in March but Siemiatkowski doesn't feel the pressure just yet. He joined Yahoo Finance to discuss the growing buy now pay later space.Siemiatkowski said he loves Apple (AAPL) Pay, but it hasn’t caught up to Klarna yet, “there’s so many limitations that it will take years before this product has any potential significant impact on what we’re doing.”When it comes to other major companies in the space, Siemiatkowski said that in his 18 years in the business Klarna has stayed competitive. “First it was like Paypal (PYPL) is too big and they were going to kill us in the Nordics and they were going to kill us in the German speaking countries, and then they were going to kill us in the UK and here we are now killing them in the U.S.,” he said.Where Siemiatkowski is worried about competition is startups, not tech giants. “It's the startups and the new people coming with new, great ideas moving at super slight speed. Those are the ones you should be worried about as a company,” he said.Watch the full interview with Seana Smith and Dave Briggs here.Key video moments:00:00:09 On Paypal00:00:27 On Apple Pay Later00:02:18 On startupsVideo TranscriptDAVE BRIGGS: So the consumer is strong and so, too, is the competition. Apple getting in your space. What's your reaction?SEBASTIAN SIEMIATKOWSKI: I don't know. You know, I've been in this-- I've been doing this for 18 years. First, it was like PayPal was too big, and they were going to kill us in the Nordics, and then they were going to kill us in the German-speaking countries, and then they were going to kill us in the UK. And here we are beating them in the US.I don't know. Like, I just-- I think-- I don't want to be arrogant to big companies' abilities to be competitive, but they're also-- if you look at Buy Now, Pay Later, with Apple right now and Apple Pay Later, it's actually-- while, obviously, I love Apple Pay-- in store, it works amazingly well. But if you look at the top 100 US retailers, more people offer Klarna now, those in the US, than offer Apple Pay.Story continuesI'm not talking about Apple Pay Later. In order to use Apple Pay Later, you Also have to sign up for it. It only works on Safari. It doesn't work in Chrome. It only works on an iPhone. It doesn't work on your desktop. I mean, there's so many limitations that it will take years before this product has any potential significant impact on what we're doing.And to us, Buy Now, Pay Later, is just a feature. I think the strongest and most fantastic thing about Klarna is on every transaction we process, we carry SKU level data. When you shop with us at Macy's, we can show you not only that you bought for $100, exactly images of the items that you bought and the sizes, and the colors.And in this AI-powered world that we're going, this data and the fact that consumers are sharing this data with us is creating fantastic opportunities to match consumers to new brands, to new businesses and providing them an even better way to save money, save time, make them less worried about their finances. So it's like, I think that the-- that's really the key thing that media misses on Klarna is SKU level data.There's no other network out there-- Visa, Mastercard, none of them has this network on the rails, and that's creating for us unique opportunity. Buy Now, Pay Later, is a fantastic feature. It's grown a lot of interest. But for me, Klarna is so much more than that. And if Apple Pay Later becomes the buy-now, pay-later offer, sure, fine. But that doesn't solve that Apple doesn't have access to SKU level.SEANA SMITH: All right, Sebastian. Actually, that's a pretty good answer because I would have thought that maybe you would have been a little bit worried if a tech giant like Apple was encroaching a little bit into your space. But let's talk about--SEBASTIAN SIEMIATKOWSKI: I'm worried about startups. I think you have to be worried about startups. They're the one you should be careful about. The big companies are the big companies. It's the startups, the new people coming with new great ideas moving at super lightspeed. Those are the ones you should be worried about as a company.SEANA SMITH: Good.]"

To see more such stocks, click 5 Best Gig Economy Stocks To Invest In.Gig economy seems to be one of the most anti-fragile industries since it experiences growth even during the most difficult times. The online freelancing market saw a huge boost during the pandemic, when millions of workers were either laid off or were forced to work from home. These workers found new possibilities of making money using freelancing platforms like Upwork and Fiverr. The next downturn came in 2022 amid rising inflation and the Federal Reserve’s policy of increasing interest rates. As inflation started to bite people’s paychecks and eat into savings, millions of people sought to find side hustles for extra income.The October 2022 jobs report showed the number of Americans working part-time jobs along with their full-time jobs jumped 6% during the month on a year-over-year basis to reach 4.5 million people. A Wall Street Journal report quoted a survey from jobs platform Monster.com, according to which about three-quarters of workers said they need extra jobs due to inflation. The report also quoted a survey of 4,700 people conducted by Prudential Financial Inc. According to the results, 81% of Gen-Z and 77% of millennial workers have pursued or plan to find gig work to supplement their income.According to a study by National Bureau of Economic Research, independent contractors may account for about 15% of the total workforce in America. This surprising metric paints a different picture of the labor market since the Bureau of Labor Statistics had estimated this figure to be just 7%. Here’s how the National Bureau of Economic Research explains its findings:“We find that, upon probing, roughly one in 10 workers who initially reports working for an employer on one or more jobs (and thus is coded as an employee) is in fact an independent contractor on at least one of those jobs. Incorporating these miscoded workers into estimates of work arrangement on the main job nearly doubles the share who are independent contractors, to about 15 percent of all workers. Young workers, less-educated workers, workers of color, multiple-job holders, and those with low hours are more likely to be miscoded. Taking these workers into account substantively changes the demographic profile of the independent contractor workforce. Our research indicates that probing in household surveys to clarify a worker’s employment arrangement and identify all low-hours work is critical for accurately measuring independent contractor work.”Story continuesThe rise of online freelancing platforms like Upwork Inc. (UPWK) and Fiverr International Ltd (NYSE:FVRR) has allowed millions of people to find gigs to supplement their income. Many are finding full-time jobs on these platforms as well. Upwork Inc. (UPWK) published a study back in December 2022 which shows the stunning impact of these freelancing platforms on the overall economy and also the importance of gig economy. Upwork Inc. (UPWK) said that its study of US workforce showed that a whopping 60 million Americans performed freelance work in the past 12 months. This is 39% of the entire US workforce.American freelancers contributed an astounding $1.35 trillion in annual earnings to the U.S. economy, $50 billion more than in 2021.Amid the trends like “Quiet Quitting” and “The Great Resignation,” the importance of paying attention to gig economy stocks becomes even more important. The huge market these gig economy companies are operating in is enough to make any beginner investor tempted to study and consider investments in the space. A report from 2019 said that the global gig economy generated $204 billion in gross volume. This figure was expected to reach $455 billion by 2023. Importantly, transportation-based services like Uber and Lyft accounted for 58% of this total volume in 2019.Impact of Gig Economy on Labor MarketThere’s been a lot of talk about the strong labor market of the US and how the Federal Reserve’s consistent rake hikes have been unable to cull the excessive job openings. Interestingly, gig economy has a small but very important role to play in all of this. As we mentioned above, the number of Americans having multiple jobs is rising. But not everyone is finding a side job because of financial hardships. Many Americans are doing multiple jobs because of the sheer availability of these jobs, the flexibility of these jobs and an urge to earn some extra cash. According to a Bloomberg report, Julia Pollak, chief economist at jobs website ZipRecruiter Inc., explain this trend in these words:“Public perception is that people take on multiple jobs when the economy is bad because they’re not earning enough in their job. People take on additional jobs when there are additional jobs to be had.”Best Gig Economy Stocks To Invest InPhoto by Peggy Anke on Unsplash Our MethodologyFor this article we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and picked 11 companies operating in the gig economy space.

Price and EPS SurprisePaycom Software, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Paycom Software, Inc. QuoteKey Factors at PlayPaycom’s first-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from strong demand for latest products, new business wins and the high-margin recurring revenue business. The company’s employee usage strategy, sales efforts and investments might have contributed to sales growth in the quarter to be reported.The cloud-based human capital management solution provider earlier announced its intention to aggressively drive advertising and marketing efforts to generate more demo leads, virtual meetings and increased close rates of deals. This is likely to have led to market share gains for Paycom.The company expects strong adoption of BETI solution, an industry-first technology that empowers employees to do their payroll among clients, aiding them to avoid time-consuming manual checks. We anticipate new client additions to have driven the top line in the first quarter.However, Paycom’s quarterly performance is expected to have been affected by macroeconomic uncertainty-triggered economic and business disruptions, which might have hurt the headcount across its client base.

304,4524e574-7514-375f-a78c-e4c3072a7ab9,IBM,2023-04-28,15 Largest PC Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-largest-pc-companies-world-194010453.html,1682624410,STORY,"['HPQ', 'LNVGY', 'DELL', 'PCRFY', 'IBM', 'CRSR', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL']","[In this article, we take a closer look at the 15 largest PC companies in the world. You can skip our detailed analysis and head straight to our list of 5 largest PC companies in the world.The International Data Corporation (IDC) has released preliminary results indicating that during the first quarter of 2023 (1Q23), traditional PC shipments dropped by 29.0% compared to the same period in 2022. Canalys reports an even steeper drop of 33%, indicating a worrying trend for the industry. The drop was due to low demand, excess inventory, and an unstable global economy. In the first quarter of 2023, global shipments amounted to 56.9 million, which indicates a decline as during the first quarter of 2022, the global shipments were 80.2 million.IDC highlights that due to the current slowdown in growth and demand, factories are now considering producing PCs outside of China. The pause in demand has also given PC makers time to reorganize their plans for 2023, as they are currently placing orders for Chromebooks before licensing costs increase later. Although there may be a temporary decrease in PC shipments, the industry is expected to recover towards the end of 2023. Key playersThe largest PC companies worldwide were also not immune to this contraction. During Q1 2023, the top five PC giants with the most significant market share experienced double-digit shipment declines. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) performed the worst with a 40.5% difference compared to Q1 2022.Lenovo maintained its position as the global leader in total shipments with 12.7 million units and a market share of 22.4% despite facing a hard time in the US market. Although the company experienced the sharpest decline in annual shipments in its corporate history over two quarters, it saw modest growth in Japan due to end-of-fiscal-year PC purchases in 2022.HP Inc (NASDAQ:HPQ) ranked second in the global PC market with 12 million shipments and a 21.1% market share. However, the company experienced its seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit shipment decline. While HP shipments in the EMEA region dropped by 37% compared to the same period last year, the decline in the US market was less severe.Story continuesDell Technologies Inc (NYSE:Dell) held the third position with 9.5 million shipments, representing 16.7% of the market share. The company recorded its fourth consecutive quarter of decline, and its Asia Pacific market was severely affected, with an over 40% decline. The weak PC market was the primary factor contributing to Dell's decline.Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) held the fourth position in the market with 4.1 million shipments, representing a 7.2% market share. Asus followed in fifth place with 3.9 million shipments, accounting for 6.8% of the market.Quantum Computing in Development Tech giants are currently investing in the development of quantum computing technology. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has set a goal of building a quantum computer by 2029, while International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) plans to have a 1,000-qubit quantum computer in place by 2023. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is offering access to quantum technology through its Azure Quantum platform, and there is also interest from financial-services companies such as JPMorgan Chase and Visa.According to Medium, Quantum computers, such as Google's Sycamore, are significantly faster than classical computers or supercomputers. For example, Sycamore could calculate a narrow-range problem in 200 seconds that would take IBM's Summit supercomputer 10,000 years to solve. Quantum computing can disrupt the traditional computing industry by providing much faster and more powerful computing capabilities. However, quantum computing is limited to a very narrow range of applications. For these kinds of applications, the demand could shift from traditional PCs to quantum computing services offered by companies such as Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). The Emerging Edge ComputingGartner predicts that 80% of enterprises will shut down their traditional data centers by 2025 due to the latency issues of traditional cloud computing, which relies on servers in one central location. As a result, many companies are shifting towards edge-computing service providers that bring computation, data storage, and analytics closer to the end-user location, resulting in improved response times. Content Delivery Networks like Cloudflare are making edge computing accessible and are expected to power the web in the future.For the largest PC companies, this could involve developing more powerful and efficient processors and integrating edge computing capabilities into their products. Additionally, PC companies may need to collaborate with edge computing service providers like Cloudflare to ensure compatibility and optimal performance. Finally, as more businesses adopt edge computing, there may be increased demand for PC products with enhanced security features to protect sensitive data being processed at the edge.Zero Trust: The Future of Data ProtectionThe Zero Trust model, a modern security architecture, provides security against ransomware and cybersecurity threats by assigning the least required access needed to perform specific tasks. Large companies like Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) invest heavily in developing Zero Trust solutions, quickly becoming the best practice in any industry. It explains why International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) reports that the data breaches cost companies $4.35 million on average, globally. Adopting zero-trust security models has multiple implications for the largest PC companies in the world. It will require them to invest in sophisticated security tools, ensure compatibility with the framework, and offer devices with built-in security features such as biometric authentication, encryption, and secure boot processes. 15 Largest PC Companies in the WorldPhoto by Hack Capital on UnsplashMethodologyThe methodology used to rank the largest PC companies in the world is based on the annual revenue generated by the companies in 2022.

McDonald's (MCD) has hinted at a new digital enhancement that allows employees to know when a customer is nearby so they can begin prepping their food. Even execs from the big soft drink and snack makers — The Coca-Cola Co. (KO) and PepsiCo (PEP) — have weighed in. But the fast-fooders have been the real players. Here's a pocket guide to some innovations — and a few yellow flags as well:ChipotleIn a call with investors, CEO Brian Niccol said the fast-casual chain has discussed the idea of AI internally.""We've worked with a lot of our employees to identify what are the tasks that they would love to see us bring automation to, or AI, so that hopefully, the role can become less complicated...I think there's just other places in the back of the restaurant where we have the ability to automate, whether it's on the digital make-line or other tasks...""For instance, last fall Chipotle rolled out testing for a new kitchen management system to streamline operations, plus a new robot called Chippy that makes tortilla chips.Then, in an interview with Yahoo Finance on Wednesday, Chipotle CFO Jack Hartung said AI presents ""endless possibilities"" that it is exploring with its Cultivate Next fund. This new venture is intended to invest in ""forward-thinking ventures that are looking to drive meaningful change at scale [and] will help accelerate Chipotle's aggressive growth plans,"" per the release.Hartung warned, though, ""there's also a lot of pitfalls as well, so we want to be very careful, very thoughtful.""He added: ""Certainly, if there's ways we can make the job that our crews, do the jobs that our support staff do to support a restaurant easier, better and if the end result is we can run better restaurants and serve the customers in a better way, we're certainly going to look at any technology.""Story continuesFuture chips: Chippy, is an autonomous kitchen assistant that integrates culinary traditions with artificial intelligence to make tortilla chips.

As part of that, IBM acquired McD Tech Labs, an innovation hub created after McDonald's acquired Apprente in 2019.All these investments are part of its larger growth strategy called Accelerating the Arches 2.0.There's a bump in the road: consumer concern.

Chevron said it conducts business in compliance with all laws, regulations and a sanctions framework provided by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).Valero Energy Corp also has received cargoes from Chevron with tanker Caribbean Voyager discharging about 500,000 barrels at its 340,000-bpd St. Charles, Louisiana, refinery on Thursday.The top independent refiner did not immediately respond to a request for comment, however, Gary Simmons, its chief commercial officer, said in an earnings call on Thursday that Venezuelan production is forecast to grow and help ease tight supplies of heavy sour crude oil.Chevron has sent Venezuelan crude to its 369,000-bpd Pascagoula, Mississippi, refinery and this month shipped a cargo to a Bahamas oil-storage terminal, PDVSA's schedules showed.(Reporting by Arathy Somasekhar and Marianna Parraga in Houston; Editing by Marguerita Choy)]"

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s first-quarter revenues is pegged at $2.23 billion, suggesting 0.7% growth from the prior-year period’s reported figure.The consensus mark for earnings has moved down by a penny in the past 30 days to 26 cents per share.

Strength in its Coors Light and Miller Lite brands bodes well. The company has been on track with increased investments toward core brands and innovations. These elements are anticipated to have improved Molson Coors' first-quarter performance.Positive pricing and favorable brand and channel mix, stemming from portfolio premiumization and fewer on-premise channel restrictions, are expected to have aided the company’s first-quarter earnings.TAP has been witnessing strong market share gains, driven by its innovation and premiumization efforts. In a bid to accelerate portfolio premiumization, it has been aggressively growing its above-premium portfolio in the past few years. The continued strength of the U.S. hard seltzer portfolio, particularly the successful launch of Simply Spiked Lemonade and strength in Blue Moon and Peroni’s, bodes well. This is likely to have boosted sales of the company’s above-premium beer category in the to-be-reported quarter.The company’s revitalization plan has been aiming to achieve sustainable top-line growth by streamlining the organization and reinvesting resources into its brands and capabilities. As part of this plan, it has been investing in iconic brands and growth opportunities in the above-premium beer space, expanding in adjacencies and beyond beer, and creating digital competencies for commercial functions, supply-chain-related system capabilities and employees. These investments are expected to get reflected in Molson Coors’ first-quarter top line. Also, the company’s cost-saving program has been one of the key growth drivers.For 2023, management expects net sales growth in the low-single digits in constant currency. Underlying EBIT is likely to increase in the low-single digits in constant currency.However, management expects higher marketing investments in core brands for 2023 from the year-ago period. Also, inflationary pressures related to higher transportation costs are expected to have led to higher cost of goods sold in the quarter under review. Apart from these, global supply-chain disruptions and higher freight costs are likely to have been concerning.Molson Coors has been witnessing weakened consumer demand across the beer industry in its Central and Eastern European regions. This is mainly due to soft industry pressure and pricing actions taken. On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management expected global inflationary pressures to be a headwind. Also, it expected the impacts of the Russia-Ukraine conflict to affect its performance. These factors are likely to affect the company’s bottom line in the first quarter.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Molson Coors this time around.

(Operator Instructions) Please also note today's event is being recorded.At this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Ed Lowenfeld, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.Ed LowenfeldThanks, Jamie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Lear's first quarter 2023 earnings call. Presenting today are Ray Scott, Lear President and CEO; and Jason Cardew, Senior Vice President and CFO. Other members of Lear's senior management team have also joined us on the call. Following prepared remarks, we will open up the call for Q&amp;A. You can find a copy of the presentation that accompanies these remarks at ir.lear.com. Before Ray begins, I'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Lear's expectations for the future. As detailed in our safe harbor statement on Slide 2, our actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-Q and other periodic reports. I also want to remind you that during today's presentation, we will refer to non-GAAP financial metrics. You are directed to the slides in the appendix of our presentation for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The agenda for today's call is on Slide 3. First, Ray will review highlights from the quarter and provide a business update. Jason will then review our first quarter financial results. Finally, Ray will offer some concluding remarks. Following the formal presentation, we would be happy to take your questions. Now I'd like to invite Ray to begin.Story continuesRaymond E. ScottThanks, Ed. Now please turn to Slide 5, which highlights key financial metrics for the first quarter. Lear started the year strong, delivering significant increases in both revenue and earnings in the first quarter compared to last year.Sales increased 12% to $5.8 billion, and core operating earnings increased 43% to $263 million. Adjusted earnings per share increased 54% to $2.78 per share. Slide 6 outlines key highlights for -- from the quarter. Both Seating and E-Systems had significant growth over market and higher margins as compared to last year. In Seating, we are excited to announce that the Conquest award we mentioned on our last earnings call is for the Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer. They will be producing complete seats in key thermal components for these vehicles, with production beginning later this year. This Conquest award is another example of Lear's strong reputation for quality, operational excellence and product execution, as we expand our strong relationship and partnership with Stellantis.In E-Systems, we continue to increase momentum in electrification with additional awards for 2 of our innovative products. Stellantis recognized our advanced technical capabilities as the premier supplier of high-performance battery disconnect units and selected Lear to supply the BDU for a new electric vehicle. We continue to increase our Intercell connect board backlog with the award of additional volumes from General Motors to support their Ultium Battery platform. Our customers continue to recognize Lear for innovative technology and quality.For the sixth consecutive year, we are recognized as a supplier of the year for General Motors. I'm excited that we completed the acquisition of IGB, which will play a key role in expanding our Thermal Comfort Systems business and increasing our market share and margins in Seating. I want to thank everyone who supported this transaction. There's a lot of hard work and significant time spent to close this deal. I couldn't be more proud to welcome the IGB team to the Lear family. Slide 7 provides a business profile of IGB and highlights the benefits of the transaction. IGB brings new technologies to Lear, including active cooling, steering wheel heating and occupant detection sensors. This transaction also complements the product capabilities we acquired from Kongsberg and add scale to our growing Thermal Comfort Systems business. IGB has a well-balanced customer base, consisting of many of the world's largest global OEMs. This acquisition is the latest and final piece of our comprehensive thermal comfort strategy to extend Lear's leadership as the most vertically integrated automotive seat supplier, increase market share and further strengthen our industry-leading margin and return profile.Lear is the only company with this expertise to complete incomplete seats as well as comprehensive thermal comfort systems capabilities. These unique capabilities will drive transformation of the thermal comfort systems market by creating innovative designs that will improve performance, efficiency and comfort, while reducing weight and cost.On Slide 8, I will walk you through the evolution of our thermal comfort systems product strategy. Today, many OEMs design and source each thermal component individually and package them together by layering them on top of each other. Several of these features rely on subcomponents that are redundant, increasing the number of parts and requiring more space for packaging.The acquisitions of Kongsberg and IGB as well as the work we have done internally over the last 10 years developing into seating provide a broad-based capability to improve this model. At the time, leveraging best practices across the combined organization will improve efficiency and increase flexibility in our manufacturing facilities.Following the Kongsberg acquisition, our team has been working diligently to design more efficient thermal comfort modules by combining common functions across multiple components. For instance, we're developing a system that integrates ventilation with the lumbar and the massage modules. We also are developing innovative solutions to move thermal comfort components closer to the occupant by integrating them directly into the trim covers. This will improve the performance of thermal comfort systems by increasing the speed to sensation for the occupant. This also reduces the size of packaging within the seat, which facilitates integration of these features into the rear seats. Another innovative product to be developed is FlexAir, a foam alternative that is 100% recyclable. FlexAir reduces CO2 emissions by up to 50% and mask by up to 20% compared to traditional foam used in today's applications.These innovations are gaining traction with our customers. We currently have 15 development projects in progress on 41 different car lines, with 7 OEMs for our various thermal comfort systems. Because our customers recognize the benefit of more efficient thermal comfort systems, they have begun to grant sourcing control of these products to Lear. Since Lear is the only JIT supplier with these capabilities, the additional sourcing control is limited just to us.This gives us an advantage in the marketplace, and we can provide higher performing and more efficient solutions to our customers.The final phase of our strategy is to combine our component modular solutions with our FlexAir foam alternative and trim cover capabilities to develop a fully integrated seat module by incorporating all of the thermal comfort components into an efficient modular design. We can drive significant part reduction and mass savings, while enhancing the comfort for the occupant.These improvements will further reduce the cost of the thermal comfort system to our customers, while increasing the value proposition for Lear Corporation. Slide 9 provides a pro forma outlook of our combined thermal comfort portfolio. The addition of the IGB product portfolio gives us strong market position in each of the key thermal comfort categories. We estimate we have a top 3 market position for each major product.Pro forma 2022 revenue for the combined TCS business is $550 million. We expect this to grow to approximately $800 million by 2027. Revenue growth will come from a combination of industry factors and innovation. The overall thermal comfort market is estimated to grow over 2 percentage points faster than the vehicle production.With improved packaging, better performance and reduced costs, we are confident that the market will grow more quickly, as take rates increase and these products proliferate beyond the luxury segment and into the rear seat applications.Historically, our customers granted sourcing control for thermal comfort components on about 30% of the JIT programs. Given our increased capabilities, our opportunity to direct this sourcing has grown. 7 major customers have branded us 100% sourcing control for future thermal comfort systems. The unique competitive advantage we have developed in thermal comfort systems allows us to provide a better value proposition for our customers, which our competitors cannot match. Longer term, in addition to driving higher market share, we believe that our thermal comfort system strategy has the potential to drive our overall seating profitability above our current 7.5% to 8.5% margin target.Turning to Slide 10, I will highlight some key business awards from the first quarter. The Conquest win for the Wagoneer and the Grand Wagoneer is a significant program that was included in our 3-year backlog we announced in February. We also won an award to provide seats on a second program launching in late 2024.We estimate the combined revenue for these 2 programs could reach approximately $600 million in 2027. Since 2019, we have won $2 billion in Conquest awards. It's a big number, Frank. Given our strong pipeline of Conquest opportunities we are pursuing, we expect this momentum to continue and result in additional market share gains. For each systems, we continue to win awards in electrification as well as for high-voltage and low-voltage wiring and several EV platforms. The pace of new business wins in E-Systems this year is well ahead of where we were last year at this time. Just last week, we were awarded the BDU for the new Stellantis electric vehicle. This win solidifies our position as one of the leaders in high-performance BDUs.The additional volume awarded by General Motors for the ICB is another example of their confidence in our technical capabilities and increasing the value of our overall program. Our expected 2025 revenue on the platform has increased to $50 million to over $100 million. We had expected this program to generate annual revenues of approximately $150 million. With the added volume, we now see peak revenue reaching $250 million.Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jason for the financial review.Jason M. CardewThank you, Ray. Slide 12 shows vehicle production and key exchange rates for the first quarter. Global production increased 6% compared to the same period last year and was up 8% on a Lear sales weighted basis. Production volumes increased by 10% in North America and by 17% in Europe, while volumes in China were down 8%. The dollar strengthened against both the euro and RMB.Slide 13 highlights Lear's growth over market. For the first quarter, total company growth over market was 6 percentage points, driven by favorable platform mix and the impact of new business in both segments, with Seating growing 6 points above market and E-Systems growing 4 points above market. Growth over market was particularly strong in Europe and in China. In Europe, sales outperformed industry production by 12 points, with both business segments benefiting from higher volumes on the Land Rover, Range Rover and Defender.New programs such as the BMW 7 Series in Seating and new wiring and electronics content on the Volvo XC40 and XC40 Recharge in E-Systems contributed to the strong growth in the region as well.In China, growth over market of 8 points resulted from strong production on the Mercedes C-Class and E-Class in Seating and the Volvo XC40 and XC40 Recharge in E-Systems. Our North America business lagged industry growth estimates by 1 percentage point. This was driven by unfavorable platform that's primarily related to the changeover of the Ford Escape in E-Systems, which was partially offset by the benefit of new business. Turning to Slide 14. I will highlight our financial results for the first quarter of 2023. Sales increased 12% year-over-year to $5.8 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, commodities and acquisitions, sales were up by 14%, reflecting increased production on key Lear platforms and the addition of new business. Core operating earnings were $263 million compared to $184 million last year. The increase in earnings resulted from the impact of higher production on their platforms and the addition of new business, partially offset by the impact from foreign exchange.Adjusted earnings per share improved significantly to $2.78 as compared to $1.80 a year ago. First quarter operating cash flow was a use of $36 million. Operating cash flow was negatively impacted in the quarter by the timing the customers received as compared to last year and a significant increase in sales late in the quarter. Our outlook for full year operating and free cash flow is unchanged.Slide 15 explains the variance in sales and adjusted operating margins in the Seating segment. Sales for the first quarter were $4.5 billion, an increase of $540 million or 14% from 2022, driven primarily by an increase in volumes on Lear platforms and our strong backlog.Excluding the impact of commodities, foreign exchange and acquisitions, sales were up 15%. Core operating earnings improved to $300 million, up $83 million or 38% from 2022, with adjusted operating margins of 6.7%. The improvement in margins reflected higher volumes on their platforms and an improvement in commodity costs, partially offset by higher engineering spending and launch costs to support our strong new business backlog and recent Conquest awards as well as the impact of foreign exchange and acquisitions.Slide 16 explains the variance in sales and adjusted operating margins in the E-Systems segment. Sales for the first quarter were $1.4 billion, an increase of $97 million or 8% from 2022. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange and commodities, sales were up 12%, driven primarily by higher volumes on key platforms and our new business backlog.Core operating earnings improved to $49 million or 3.5% of sales compared to $42 million and 3.2% of sales in 2022. The improvement in margins reflected higher volumes on Lear platforms and our margin-accretive backlog, partially offset by higher commodity costs, net of customer recovery, the impact of foreign exchange and elevated launch costs.Moving to Slide 17. We highlight our strong balance sheet and liquidity profile, a major competitive advantage for Lear in a rising interest rate environment. The acquisition of IGB will be financed with the 3-year fully prepayable term loan. We do not have any near-term outstanding debt maturities. Our earliest bond maturity is in 2027, and our debt structure has a weighted average life of approximately 14 years.Our cost of debt is low, averaging approximately 4%. In addition, we had $2.9 billion of available liquidity. We remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders, having repurchased $25 million worth of stock in the first quarter, along with our quarterly dividend.Our current share repurchase authorization has approximately $1.2 billion remaining, which allows us to repurchase shares through the end of 2024. Now turning to Slide 18. This slide highlights the key factors that will impact our financial outlook. While our first quarter results were strong, and industry production volumes are continuing to recover, there is still uncertainty around the pace of the recovery and overall global macro environment.As a result, we are not changing our full year outlook at this time. We expect a modest improvement in industry production levels this year, while remaining well below prior peak levels. We expect a gradual but sustained recovery stretching into 2024 and beyond.The outlook for commodity cost is somewhat mixed. While we did see a significant reduction in steel prices late last year, prices in North America has since rebounded. We are seeing some moderation in select chemical commodity prices as well as freight and logistics costs, but also experiencing higher component costs as our supply base contends with higher labor costs. On the positive side, we expect to largely offset the headwinds we're facing through improved operating performance and negotiated sharing agreements with our customers. In addition, we're benefiting from resilient demand on luxury vehicles and other key platforms as well as our margin-accretive backlog.As we weigh these risks and opportunities, we continue to take aggressive steps to improve our competitive position and financial performance. We also continue to make significant progress through our Lear Forward initiatives, including aggressive steps to improve capacity utilization and working capital management and remain on track to meet or exceed our $50 million savings target for the year. These performance improvement actions, coupled with strategic investments in key products such as thermal comfort systems and high-voltage connection systems have positioned both businesses for sustained revenue growth and margin expansion.Now I'll turn it back to Ray for some closing thoughts.Raymond E. ScottThanks, Jason. Please turn to Slide 20. The first quarter was a great start to the year. Both business segments saw year-over-year margin growth, with strong growth over market.Our Lear Forward plan continues to yield results. The team has identified and implemented actions that will reduce costs and improve operating cash flow. We continue to win business in both Seating and E-Systems, and our pipeline of new opportunities is very strong.Closing the IGB transaction was the final piece required to solidify our thermal comfort systems strategy. With this completed, we are looking forward to giving you a comprehensive update of our Seating business, with a particular focus on thermal comfort on June 27. We'll be hosting a Seating Product Day on Lear Campus in Southfield, Michigan. We look forward to seeing many of you in person. In closing, I want to thank the Lear team for their tireless efforts that resulted in another strong quarter. I firmly believe we have the best team in the industry, and I am proud to work with you each and every day. Now we'd be happy to take your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from John Murphy from Bank of America.John Joseph MurphyMaybe just to ask one simple one first, just on scheduled stabilization. I'm just wondering if you could kind of highlight how much they've stabilized in the first quarter, how much sort of the disruption caused to you last year and what do you expect to not reoccur this year?Raymond E. ScottLook, actually, this year, I always say everything is all relative. It's -- this year is a lot better year than last year. When we talked about just stable production from our customers, we're getting a lot better clarity around if there is going to be downtime, so that we can respond a lot quicker in respect to what we can do internally from an efficiency standpoint.So much more clarity around the production environment, although there's been still some short notice, but much better than it was last year as far as the financial strength.Jason, do you want to add to that?Jason M. CardewYes. Really, it was -- we didn't see a meaningful premium cost in the quarter. It did improve versus the prior year. We've seen a gradual improvement, John, as you look at sort of first half of last year to the second half of last year and then again in the first quarter. As Ray mentioned, we're still incurring some premium costs. We're still seeing some stop-start production from our customers, some challenges with some of the new programs that our customers are changing over and some challenges with our supply base, which weighs a little bit on the conversion rates you see with volume in the backlog, but certainly less meaningful than what we experienced over the last 2 years.John Joseph MurphyOkay. And then just a second question on IGB in the acquisition there. Is there a greater opportunity on content with EVs as you're looking at sort of the in-seat HVAC systems essentially versus what you have on the ICE?And I think you also -- I just want to follow up on something I think you mentioned that -- you said CD margins, which are targeted 7.5% to 8.5% eventually. There could be upside to that 7.5% to 8.5% because of IGB. And just wanted to kind of clarify that statement as well or confirm it.Raymond E. ScottYes, John, I'm glad you asked the question. One, I couldn't be more excited. This is a big day for Lear Corporation. This has been 10 years in the works. And going back, we're just discussing amongst the team here before the call.At 10 years, we looked at the inefficiencies within the seat. And when we talk about these priceable features and content within the seat, how they could be completely revamped and redesigned for packaging and efficiency and cost and mass and weight. And so all those elements are particularly of interest to our customers on EV vehicles. One, just the draw of -- and use of the battery consumption, the better use of the combination of HVAC in-seat seed for the occupant. Within the seat, the packaging that we're going to be able to proliferate these, I think, across multiple different seat sets. And I think equally as important, not just luxury vehicles, but be able to use in a more mid-vehicle ranges because we're going to have a much more efficient system. So short-term, we're looking at this thing. It is just we have this in 3 phases. One is just doing a really good job with our purchasing leverage, the ability to scale things properly with our manufacturing facilities on the traditional parts. And they're both great, great companies, and they complete what we're really focused on. We also protect ourselves with almost 400 patents on the new design that I was referring to as far as we get into these modular components. And we believe that, that's going to allow us to grow. And those components that we're referring to are accretive in respect to margins. So our goal is to offer our customers a great value proposition, but also more importantly to us is expand our margin, and that's really the intent of this.And it really culminated in the acquisition of IGB. Kongsberg was a great acquisition. IGB is a great acquisition. But now we're well rounded in what we're going to do as far as priceable features within the seat system.Jason M. CardewYes. The only thing I would add, Ray, to what was important about IGB, it brought steering wheel heat and panel heating, which I think also plays an important role as you think about reducing the use of the HVAC and the impact on the battery and shifting that to other parts of the interior that are more efficient for heating and cooling the occupant. So that's important additional product capabilities that we were after with IGB.Raymond E. ScottJohn, we talked about the Investor Day, we're going to have 2 -- we don't share a lot publicly for competitive reasons. But when you see what we're talking about as far as the transformational change of the components, when we put this in front of the customer, Frank's here, it's a layup.I mean, it's amazing. It is -- it's not traditional for us to get 100% of sourcing control on these programs. We're getting it because of the acquisitions we've made and the capabilities we have and the vision of the value that we can create.And so at the Investor Day, we are really excited about being able to disclose a little bit more about what we've been working on for over 10 years and the change to the seat system and how we believe that can -- I think this $2.5 billion to $3 billion market can grow faster when you actually have a system that creates a significant value for your customers.John Joseph MurphyAnd if I could just sneak one more in on the IGB Intercell connect boards. You seem like you're winning more and more on the Ultium platform. I mean that is a platform. So I'm just curious, when you think about that, how much share do you have on that Ultium platform as far as you can tell on what you've won so far? I mean, is that being dual sourced? Or are you sole-sourced on that? What's the story there?Raymond E. ScottIt's still sourced today, and we have a strong position with General Motors on that particular component, yes, 50%.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Rod Lache from Wolfe Research.Rod Avraham LacheSo I had a couple of things I wanted to ask about. The E-Systems margins currently running at 3.5%, you had guided to 4.5% for the year. And I was just hoping you could give us a little bit of color on what changes from here, thoughts on incremental margins. Does your guidance still hold?Because the -- obviously, the exit rate would be quite a bit higher to make it average that. And then on Seating, is it typical that incremental margins on new business would come in, in the mid-6s? Or is that something that we should extrapolate from?Jason M. CardewI'll start with the second part of the question first, Rod. So Seating backlog has been rolling out in the 8% to 10% range. And I think if you look out over the next couple of years, we would anticipate that, that's about the rate it would roll on.Sometimes, you have a blip in a quarter where you have a mix of what has rolled off versus what's rolled on. But it's generally in that 8% to 10% range is what we're seeing. If you look at the last number of quarters, that's what we've converted at. In terms of E-Systems margins, you're right. We do expect to see higher margins in the second half of the year than the first half of the year, so at 3.5% here in the first quarter. If we look out in the second quarter, the midpoint of our guidance, we would expect similar margins, maybe slightly higher in E-Systems in the second quarter, which means the second half needs to be roughly 5.5%.There's a number of catalysts to that. One, our launch costs in the first half of the year are much higher than they will be in the second half of the year. We're going through not just launching the backlog, but we had significant new program changeovers. So the Ford Escape, which we had referenced in the prepared remarks, but also the Colorado Canyon with GM is a big program for E-Systems. So those 2 programs, we had a significant investment in launch costs in the beginning part of the year, and that will be less in the second half of the year. In addition to that, we're in deep discussions, negotiations with our customers on commodity and inflation recovery. We did a nice job in the quarter, but we have a lot of work to do there. And we're confident that we'll achieve the assumptions that we've outlined for commodities in E-Systems for the full year. In addition to that, you have your normal seasonality. And so you had the LTA agreements that are contractual that we approved in the first part of the year, first quarter, second quarter that get negotiated throughout the year and then offset through our own cost reduction actions, restructuring actions, normal plant efficiencies, purchase savings with our supply base.And as is typically the case, particularly in E-Systems, you see that stuff sort of layered on throughout the year. And those things taken together, we believe, get us to about 5.5% for the second half of the year. And I would say the range is 5.5% to 6% in the fourth quarter, maybe even a little bit beyond that as we exit the year in E-Systems.Rod Avraham LacheOkay. And I didn't quite understand kind of the net of the puts and takes that you're mentioning on commodities. Maybe you could just elaborate on that. And it sounded like the -- there's a little bit of caution in your tone, not surprising just in light of macro, but you had given an indication about potentially coming in at the higher end of your guidance range earlier in the year. Are you seeing anything in terms of customer schedules or mix that is resulting in that? Or is that just conservatism?Jason M. CardewYes. I would characterize it more as caution and conservatism at this stage. Nothing has changed from when I spoke at an investor conference earlier in the quarter.As we sit here today, if conditions from the first quarter hold up for the balance of the year, and there isn't a significant pullback in demand that impacts production or disruption due to the labor negotiations in the U.S. and Canada that impacts production, those things don't happen, then we see the revenue at the high end of the guidance range, maybe even a little bit beyond that.And I'll provide a little bit more color on that point, it's kind of an important point. So we have a relatively conservative assumption on foreign exchange at [$1.05] for the full year, at [$1.07] in the first quarter. That implies a little less than $1.05 through the balance of the year. And if you just kind of modeled out the last 5 days average exchange rates, revenue would be about $300 million higher than what we have included in the guidance. And that would convert at the company margin overall. In addition to that, you asked about commodities. One thing that we experienced in the first quarter that we now are expecting to continue is elevated revenue as both our -- the directed suppliers, so suppliers that our customers source directly and negotiate pricing directly with, are getting price increases, and we're just kind of an administrator in the middle passing that through. So you're seeing additional revenue without earnings as our direct-to-suppliers negotiate with our customers. That's a new development as we started the year, and that's nearly $200 million of revenue.And as we're seeing additional pressure on component cost increases in our business, particularly in E-Systems, we're negotiating pass-through agreements on that. We see almost $100 million of additional revenue from that.So the commodities and FX taken together and the fact that IGB closed a little bit earlier, we see about $500 million to $600 million of sort of revenue tailwinds that may not have a lot of earnings associated with that. So we may see these conditions hold up consistent with the first quarter revenue that's at or above the high end of the range with earnings that are at the high end or maybe a little bit lower than that, as some new development staff with commodities. So then speaking specifically about commodities, what's changed from our original guidance there, we lock in our North America steel price one quarter at a time. And so the first quarter was really based on the fourth quarter. So we saw a nice reduction and nice benefit in the first quarter. Second quarter is based on the average price in the first quarter, so that is going up sequentially. We've assumed that, that sort of continues in the second half. And then by the fourth quarter, it comes back down.Based on that assumption, the net effect for steel, instead of being a $30 million benefit, is now about a $20 million benefit. So a little bit of an impact of the -- for the unrecovered portion of steel.We're seeing some favorability in chemical costs, freight and logistics, and that's helping to offset the higher steel. And then we're seeing some pressure on component costs, again, more so in E-Systems than in Seating, particularly with insulated wire. That part of the supply base is a bit more challenged.I think you see evidence of that, the challenges with Leoni that are very public. And so we are seeing some pressure on cost there, but we're also working with our customers on negotiating a sharing pass-through agreement on that.Rod Avraham LacheJust to clarify, no -- you didn't mention any transactional impact from the FX just given your peso exposure. Is that essentially hedged?Jason M. CardewYes. So for the full year, we're about 85% hedged on the peso. And most of our currency pairs were 60% to 85% in sort of the range. We were a little less hedged in the first quarter, so we did see a little impact there.We don't see a significant for the full year at this point in time. And we have a rolling 24-month hedge program. So we flagged in about 40% of that exposure for next year as well, which should help. But -- so as we sit here today, it's not a meaningful issue. It's maybe $10 million for the full year relative to what we expected at the start of the year.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Dan Levy from Barclays.Dan Meir LevySorry, I jumped on late, and I know you talked a bit about E-Systems, but maybe you could just address in the quarter the conversion was on volume mix and on backlog, which is meaningfully lower than what you had seen in prior quarters. So maybe you could just get a bit into the conversion on E-Systems within the quarter?Jason M. CardewYes. Part of that is the mix of revenue by region. And so in North America, where we tend to have a little higher variable margin profile than in Europe and in Asia. And so given the changeover activity on these key platforms like the Ford Escape and the GM Colorado Canyon, it's a pickup program. So revenue was down on those and up on our European programs and a little bit in Asia. And so that's really the driver, the sort of mix of program by region. Backlog, as we look out for the balance of the year, we expect that to continue to roll on sort of in the 10% range in E-Systems. So we feel pretty good about how the backlog is rolling on. And you can see that as continuing to be accretive to margins in E-Systems.Dan Meir LevyUnderstood. And then just as a follow-up, I know you said that for commodities, you're now assuming $20 million for the year versus the prior outlook $30 million tailwind. Maybe you could just remind us, within that number, what you're assuming on recoveries for non-raw material items, be it maybe some of the pass-through components, which you said you're seeing some recoveries there or freight or most notably labor on Europe.Are you assuming within that recoveries for labor where I know you had assumed that there was going to be some wage inflation on your side?Jason M. CardewYes. I think, Dan, at this point, we want to be a bit careful on that for competitive reasons, but we are in negotiations with our customer on labor. And oftentimes, in both business segments, we have -- we work with models that our customers have. And so the model has the labor rate input. And so that has certainly provided an opportunity for us to have a dialogue with our customers. There's a certain level of wage inflation that's our responsibility.We experience that each year, and we offset it through productivity. What we're after is really the extraordinary wage inflation in places like Mexico, where there was a significant increase in wage costs.Now in terms of the component cost increases and recovery of that, we're expecting between 90%, 95% of that will be recovered within the year. So we're not expecting that to be a significant headwind. We're expecting nearly 100% on the seating side because most of that is on direct components where our customer is negotiating with the supplier directly.The E-Systems where there's a little less that's directed, there's more work to do in those negotiations, but we still see a high level of recovery happening this year.Dan Meir LevyAnd can you just clarify within the $20 million if there's a gross number on that or that's the net there a gross number?Jason M. CardewOur growth impact for this year that we're estimating at this point is about $200 million.OperatorAnd our next question comes from James Picariello from BNP Paribas.James Albert PicarielloSo on the E-Systems' commodities and component sourcing headwind, the 6 -- $5 million or $6 million headwind for the quarter, can you just confirm what does that impact look like through the rest of the year for E-Systems?Jason M. CardewYes. It's -- we see it as a little less for the balance of the year than it was in the first quarter. I think the first and second quarter will be similar. And then more of the recovery will happen in the second half of the year.So for the full year, we don't expect it to be $25 million. If you were to extrapolate the $6 million, we expect it to be less than that with the benefit of that happening in the second half.James Albert PicarielloRight. And there's some associated recovery tied to the lessening effect in the second half. Or is this just expectation on pricing?Jason M. CardewIt's recovery that's -- that drives the difference first half to second half.James Albert PicarielloOkay. And then for IGB, will the initial contribution margin for that business trend similarly to what Kongsberg -- what we saw with Kongsberg last year, losing about, I don't know, $5 million a quarter initially?And then just on that point, it's pretty clear you view thermal comfort as margin additive to Lear Seating business over time. Can you maybe just speak to or confirm the time line on when those businesses can get there?Jason M. CardewYes. I think that we still have some work to do on the purchase accounting, that could lead to a slight change in this. But we do expect the margins in thermal comfort to be roughly breakeven this year. And we're going through some restructuring now. Ray referenced the purchasing synergies. We're seeing some opportunities there. And so we're on track for the combined business to be profitable next year. We had talked originally about it being accretive to seat margins in '24. We still see that probably in the second half or towards the tail end of '24 because it just took longer for the IGB regulatory approval and closing to get over the finish line. So when we talk about '24 being accretive, we had assumed that, at that point, that it would be kind of the full year this year in our hands, and it's obviously 4 months later than that.So we still see this business being accretive to seat margins. And I think contribution margins are going to be similar to seating or a little bit higher, so in the 20% range, 20%, 25% even on certain programs. And so over time, as we drill that business, it will -- the impact on seat margins will continue to increase and culminate with pushing that 7.5% to 8.5% range above 8.5%. We'll save some of the details around that for the Investor Day in June. We're excited to talk about that in a little bit more detail at that point.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner from Deutsche Bank.Emmanuel RosnerI was hoping to put maybe a final point on your outlook and, I guess, what's assumed in there. Q1 played out, I guess, a bit better than expected, and then you were even improving back in March.But now based on the unchanged outlook, you'd be basically assuming some sequential deterioration in profit at midpoint or maybe sort of like stable versus the first quarter at the high end, and that's despite obviously improving margins in E-Systems, for example.So can you maybe just holistically talk about how you see sort of the rest of the year play out? Where are the areas of caution that would essentially keep you, I guess, a bit more cautious now?Jason M. CardewYes. I think the caution is just around the production volume assumption that we have a pretty good handle on and the rest of the drivers. And just so mechanically, by holding the full year with such a strong first quarter, what it suggests is that the second quarter will be about 2.5% lower. I think the industry volumes are down about 2.5% in the second quarter from the first quarter. There are fewer work days in Europe, in North America. So we think that makes sense. So say $125 million to $200 million lower than the first quarter revenue. And if that holds, then that suggests a fairly sizable contingency, so to speak, on production volumes for the second half of the year, so it would imply pretty low revenue in the second half of the year. Again, it's early. There are so many geopolitical, macroeconomic factors in play. We just thought it was prudent to hold serve at this point. And we -- if conditions hold up like the first quarter, we would certainly look to raise our outlook in -- on the second quarter earnings call.Emmanuel RosnerUnderstood. And then I guess one follow-up on the -- on E-Systems. So based on your outlook, maybe even like 5.5% margins in the second half, obviously, quite a bit more upside needed towards some of your midterm target. So as we look past, I guess, the second half or the fourth quarter exit rates, is the main driver there just adding more revenues and operating leverage? Or are there any other big factors to get you to your midterm view?Jason M. CardewYes. We talked about this, I think, on the fourth quarter earnings call. And certainly in other settings, we've described sort of that bridge from 4.5% this year to 8% in 2025.So you can look at it two different ways. One way is just looking at sort of volume and backlog. We see that as 250 basis points of the improvement from '23 to '25, and then 100 basis points of net performance. So this year, net performance is sort of negligible in both segments.We see it as 50 basis points positive in '24 and '25 through a combination of lower inflation, some continued success in passing through higher commodity costs and just fully realizing the benefits of our restructuring program and other cost reduction initiatives without that added weight of extraordinarily high wage inflation that we saw this year.Another way to look and to think about the E-Systems progression from '23 to '25, if you look at it by business segment, we talked about 100 basis points of the improvement being driven by the growth in connection systems. And certainly, this additional volume with GM on the Intercell connect board helps there. So we had previously expected $285 million of additional revenue there. It's going to be a little bit more than that now with the additional volume awarded on that platform. That's 100 basis points. If you look at our core electronics and what we're doing with that business, we see 125 basis points of margin growth over that 2-year time period in electronics, and then that sort of leaves 125 basis points for the wire business, which is a combination of net performance and stronger volumes.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Colin Langan from Wells Fargo.Colin M. LanganJust wanted to follow up. I'm not sure if I heard it right. You said there's $200 million of gross commodity headwind, but you still expect a net positive of $20 million.I guess, I'm a little confused because I thought back in '21, there was about $450 million, and you got $185 million net. So what gives you -- one, did I mishear that? And two, what gives you confidence that you could sort of get that much recovery versus the past? Are the contracts different now given the last couple of years' changes?Jason M. CardewWell, part of it is the lag effect. So you're seeing some recovery in the first part of this year, for example, that relates to higher steel costs that existed last year. And so there's a bit of a lag benefit that we're seeing.And the balance of it really is we've worked hard to get as many of our components on an indexed agreement as we can to try and kind of insulate us from that risk. And so as there are changes that take place, that makes a little bit more straightforward to pass it through. It doesn't make it easy looking at kind of Frank has certainly a ton of work by the team in both business segments.The other big factor, though, and probably the more important factor is that we see about $180 million of directed supplier increases where it's just a one-for-one pass-through. So that's really what's driving the increase, and so there's no impact on OI. So it's 100% pass-through. So it's a little bit misleading from that standpoint. If you go back to what we anticipated at the beginning of the year, we expected the gross impact to be favorable, so $105 million because of what was happening with steel. And so now that has swung all the away in the other direction where we're seeing a gross impact that's unfavorable by $200 million. That's a $300 million change again and with $180 million of that in seating on directed suppliers has just passed through.Colin M. LanganGot it. Okay. And then the last quarter, you talked about $85 million in gross labor cost headwinds. That's incremental to the $200 million talking about the clients (inaudible) not overlapping. And then any color on how that's progressing? Has the majority of that already hit, so you're working to get recoveries through the rest of the year on that? Or does more of that come later in the year?Jason M. CardewThe labor inflation on the hourly side, mostly hit beginning of the year. Now some of the salary programs have various effective dates around the world. And -- but some are in January and some are later. The discussions that the customers started in the first quarter and will continue, I think, through the balance of the year. It's not going to be all done in the second quarter. It's going to take time, and some of that could even leak into next year. So it's a difficult discussion with the customers. And ultimately, we have to be the most competitive option for them, and we are. We have a world-class footprint in both segments, and I think that's supportive of our negotiations to pass these excess costs through over time.Colin M. LanganAnd just one quick follow-up. Where does that fall in the walk? Is that under net performance, if I look at Slide 15 and 16? Because I don't even think there's net performance on 15. So which bucket does that added cost follow?Jason M. CardewThat is in the net performance. You're correct, Colin.OperatorAnd our final question today comes from Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley.Unidentified Analyst(inaudible) on behalf of Adam. We're just curious to see if you guys have seen any measurable change or slowdown in the production or orders for EVs by OEMs this year?Raymond E. ScottWe're not seeing that. I mean, across the board. It's still a heavy push from all of our customers on EV, and with some customers even additional capacity and quotes are out for additional volume. So we haven't seen the demand side change at all from our perspective, particularly with the top of the OEMs. So no changes.Unidentified AnalystOkay. And then a quick follow-up. Is -- can you say that the chip shortage is over now? Or is there still incremental production...Raymond E. ScottA little hesitant to say that. Yes. I'm hesitant. I was engraved in me for a long time. I see that we're in a much better position. What I will tell you is that what we're experienced is they're still at the brokers, there's premium costs that we're trying to negotiate.There might be chips that are available through other outlets that we can get our hands on, but there's still premiums associated with those chips. So that hasn't necessarily dissipated.But I'd say generally, and I think it's all relative to where we were a year ago, we're in a much better position. There's still certain chips that are tougher to get, but I think, holistically, across all chips, we're in a much better position.Unidentified AnalystGreat. Thank you, so much.Raymond E. ScottYes, thank you. Is that the last one? Okay. So I thank Jason, nice job today. Really a nice job and there is a lot of heavy lifting for you. That's a nice job, nice job the team here and I appreciate all the hard work for everyone that's on the phone, the Lear team, incredible quarter. I appreciate all the hard work that you're doing every single day. Really good work. And again, just so I want to welcome the IGB family into the Lear family. We're really excited. I mean, this could be a transformational change for us. We've been working on this for over 10 years. And I think that the 2 very strategic acquisitions of IGB and Kongsberg were complete. We can now move on this thing and Frank can get those margins up. And so let's get to work you guys. I appreciate everything. Thank you.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, with that, we'll conclude today's conference call and presentation. We thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your lines.]"

And when those customers do buy EVs, they are buying Teslas.In its annual EV consumer report, CarMax revealed that search volume for the word “electric” doubled from February 2022 to February 2023, when the retailer compiled data for its last EV report.  CarMax analysts first noticed a spike back in February and March of last year, not surprisingly when gas prices were spiking around the time the war in Ukraine was intensifying. CarMax says search interest then peaked in the past year in October, which coincided around the time new rules for the federal EV tax credit were being implemented.Consumer interest in EVs is rising, according to CarMaxMost interesting is the data CarMax compiled from its dealerships and online car shopping activity, which dove into what the most popular used EVs were in its inventory. According to CarMax sales data from February 2023, the top five most popular EVs were the Tesla Model 3, Tesla Model Y, Nissan Leaf, Ford Mustang Mach-E, and the Chevrolet Bolt EV.The Chevy Bolt is notable in the report. GM plans to end production at the end of the year. What this means for used pricing is uncertain. But it's possible the Bolt may see price appreciation as new inventory drops.Meanwhile, Tesla 's at the top of the EVs purchased, though it's not surprising given the sheer number on the road—and likely in CarMax’s fleet. One thing to watch: Tesla price cuts. It reduced prices of new vehicles steeply in the beginning of 2023, which could lead to CarMax adjusting used Tesla pricing to make them more attractive.CarMax did not reveal this pricing data in terms of cuts, but the retailer must have dropped prices in order to move used inventory, which then lead to higher sales.CarMax did reveal average prices paid for those used EVs in February, with the Model 3 selling for an average of $37,000, and the Model Y coming in at $47,807.Story continuesTop used EVs purchased at CarMax with average pricing for the month of February 2023.Also of note is CarMax’s trade-in business. That's where the retailer acquires a decent amount of its inventory. CarMax is famously known to offer any car a quote brought into its dealerships, from 20-year old used cars to nearly brand new supercars.When looking at those cars traded in to buy used EVs at CarMax during the September 2022 to February 2023 timeframe, CarMax found the top traded-in vehicle type were SUVs, at around 40%, followed by sedans and coupes at 29%.Even more interesting were the brands traded in for those EVs. CarMax says Toyota vehicles were the top traded-in brand at 12%, followed by BMW and Ford at 8%, Honda at 7%, and Chevy at 7%.The data highlights something of an issue with Toyota, as the brand has been slow getting up to speed with EV offerings, and has had to pivot recently to increase its push into electrification. (Toyota has only one EV on sale at the moment, the bZ4X SUV, and it is only available in limited quantities.)One more interesting nugget from CarMax data: the most common vehicles traded in for a Tesla Model 3 were the Honda Civic and Toyota Tacoma pickup. The Tacoma is somewhat surprising given the Tacoma and Model 3 aren’t exactly comparable vehicles.As for purchases of used Tesla Model Y SUVs or Model S higher-end sedans, the most common vehicle traded in was - a Tesla Model 3.—Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Tesla's market has dipped below the $500 billion mark, currently resting at $487 billion, per Yahoo Finance data.Year to date, Tesla's stock is still up 24%, compared to a 5.6% advance for the S&amp;P 500.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Investors are probably locking in on several issues that have swirled around Tesla in recent days.The initial is a bad first-quarter gross profit margin miss.

Musk and his CFO, Zach Kirkhorn, leaned into a philosophy of wanting to move more EVs, even if that means cutting prices further and pressuring margins.Wall Street was having none of it, coming out with cautious takes and downwardly revised profit estimates.""Although both technology and execution risk seem substantially less than was once feared, expansion into higher volume segments with lower price points seems fraught with greater risk relative to demand, execution, and competition,"" JP Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote in a client note.Tesla CEO Elon Musk departs the Phillip Burton Federal Building and United States Court House in San Francisco on Jan. 24, 2023.

Shares have added about 4.7% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is McCormick due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.McCormick Q1 Earnings Top Estimates, Sales Increase Y/YMcCormick reported first-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein the top and bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, and the former increased year over year.Adjusted earnings of 59 cents per share declined from 63 cents in the year-ago quarter. However, the metric surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 49 cents per share. The year-over-year decrease was a result of increased interest costs and an elevated adjusted effective tax rate.The company generated sales of $1,565.5 million, up 3% year over year. Constant-currency (cc) sales increased 5% on 11% growth from pricing actions, somewhat offset by a 2% decline in volumes. The top line came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,545 million.The volume decline stemmed from the Kitchen Basics divestiture, reduced consumption in China due to the pandemic, the exit of the Consumer business in Russia and a 3% decline from all other volumes and a product mix.The company’s gross profit margin contracted 80 basis points due to escalated cost inflation and higher other supply-chain expenses. These were somewhat countered by cost savings from the Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (“CCI”) and Global Operating Effectiveness (“GOE”) programs, along with pricing actions.The adjusted operating income was $227 million, in line with the year-ago quarter figure. At cc, the adjusted operating income rose 2%, backed by increased sales, partly negated by a gross margin decline.Consumer: Sales went down 2% to $909.5 million, while cc sales increased 1% due to a 9% rise in pricing, somewhat offset by soft volumes. The volume decline included the adverse impacts of the Kitchen Basics divestiture, reduced consumption in China due to the pandemic and the exit of Consumer the business in Russia. Sales increased 3% in the Americas, while the same tumbled 9% in the EMEA and 15% in the Asia/Pacific.Flavor Solutions: Sales in the segment advanced 10% to $656 million. On a cc basis, sales grew 12% due to solid pricing actions, partly negated by soft volumes and a product mix. Flavor Solutions’ sales in the Americas grew 13%. Flavor Solutions sales in the EMEA rose by 7%. Sales in the Asia/Pacific market dipped 1% year over year.Story continuesFiscal 2023 GuidanceMcCormick anticipates fiscal 2023 to witness a solid underlying business performance, backed by sales growth. It expects the GOE Program and the lapping of pandemic-led hurdles to have a positive effect on the fiscal 2023 operating income, which is likely to be somewhat negated by the impacts of the Kitchen Basics divestiture and a rise in employee incentive compensation costs.Management anticipates currency movements to have a minimal impact on fiscal 2023 net sales, operating income and earnings per share (EPS).For fiscal 2023, net sales are expected to increase 5-7% from the fiscal 2022 levels. Management expects sales growth to be fueled by pricing actions, which, along with cost savings, are likely to help it counter inflationary headwinds. The company anticipates seeing solid growth via brand strength, brand marketing, new products, category management and differentiated customer engagement.The adjusted operating income is likely to grow 9-11%. Management envisions the adjusted EPS in the band of $2.63-$2.68 in fiscal 2023.The company expects adjusted earnings in the band of $2.56-$2.61 per share in fiscal 2023, suggesting 1-3% growth. The bottom line is likely to be fueled by a solid operating performance, partly offset by increased interest expenses and a higher projected adjusted effective tax rate.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates review have trended upward during the past month.VGM ScoresAt this time, McCormick has a subpar Growth Score of D, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of this revision looks promising.

325,63b60484-0e0d-323a-affd-00c40e3d4938,UAL,2023-04-28,Is Delta Air Lines (DAL) a Great Value Stock Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/delta-air-lines-dal-great-134001279.html,1682602801,STORY,"['DAL', 'UAL']","[While the proven Zacks Rank places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find strong stocks, we also know that investors tend to develop their own individual strategies. With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One company value investors might notice is Delta Air Lines (DAL). DAL is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value. The stock is trading with a P/E ratio of 5.65, which compares to its industry's average of 8.55. Over the past year, DAL's Forward P/E has been as high as 12.67 and as low as 5.65, with a median of 7.17.We also note that DAL holds a PEG ratio of 0.16. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. DAL's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 0.27. Within the past year, DAL's PEG has been as high as 0.21 and as low as 0.16, with a median of 0.20.Another valuation metric that we should highlight is DAL's P/B ratio of 3.40. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. DAL's current P/B looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/B of 3.68. Within the past 52 weeks, DAL's P/B has been as high as 9.50 and as low as 3.08, with a median of 4.79.Story continuesFinally, investors will want to recognize that DAL has a P/CF ratio of 5.29. This metric takes into account a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook. DAL's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 10.58. Within the past 12 months, DAL's P/CF has been as high as 11.23 and as low as 5.29, with a median of 7.96.United Airlines (UAL) may be another strong Transportation - Airline stock to add to your shortlist. UAL is a # 2 (Buy) stock with a Value grade of A.United Airlines is trading at a forward earnings multiple of 4.57 at the moment, with a PEG ratio of 0.10. This compares to its industry's average P/E of 8.55 and average PEG ratio of 0.27.UAL's price-to-earnings ratio has been as high as 108.97 and as low as 4.57, with a median of 7.80, while its PEG ratio has been as high as 0.11 and as low as 0.10, with a median of 0.11, all within the past year.United Airlines also has a P/B ratio of 2.09 compared to its industry's price-to-book ratio of 3.68. Over the past year, its P/B ratio has been as high as 4.68, as low as 1.76, with a median of 2.87.These are only a few of the key metrics included in Delta Air Lines and United Airlines strong Value grade, but they help show that the stocks are likely undervalued right now.

326,1a7828c3-bc9e-3962-a69d-b2e59b4d9a3c,UAL,2023-04-28,Investors Heavily Search United Airlines Holdings Inc (UAL): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-united-airlines-130001747.html,1682600401,STORY,['UAL'],"[United Airlines (UAL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this airline have returned -3.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2.2% change. The Zacks Transportation - Airline industry, to which United belongs, has gained 2.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, United is expected to post earnings of $3.62 per share, indicating a change of +153.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +38.3% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.01 points to a change of +257.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +8.4%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.51 indicates a change of +16.6% from what United is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +8.9%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for United.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for UAL _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of United, the consensus sales estimate of $13.93 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +15%. The $53.02 billion and $55.92 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +18% and +5.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUnited reported revenues of $11.43 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +51.1%. EPS of -$0.63 for the same period compares with -$4.24 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.42 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.07%. The EPS surprise was +13.7%.Over the last four quarters, United surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.United is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about United. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

329,25a98593-a1b3-3342-b05f-86ae25ca81b5,PNW,2023-04-28,Earnings Preview: Pinnacle West (PNW) Q1 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-pinnacle-west-pnw-140302735.html,1682604182,STORY,['PNW'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Pinnacle West (PNW) reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 4. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis power company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.03 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -80%.Revenues are expected to be $792.07 million, up 1.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.25% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Pinnacle West?For Pinnacle West, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -69.23%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Pinnacle West will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Pinnacle West would post a loss of $0.18 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.21, delivering a surprise of -16.67%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Pinnacle West doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, the figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2%.The company’s GAAP EPS was $3.58, registering a 15.2% decline year over year.Revenues in DetailRevenues in the reported quarter improved 1% year over year to $560.2 million. However, the metric missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.6%Chemed Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseChemed Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseChemed Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Chemed Corporation QuoteSegmental DetailsChemed operates through two wholly owned subsidiaries — VITAS (a major provider of end-of-life care) and Roto-Rooter (a leading commercial and residential plumbing plus drain cleaning service provider).In the first quarter, net revenues at VITAS totaled $310.5 million, up 3.8% year over year. The rise in revenues was primarily due to a 3% increase in days of care and an increase in the geographically weighted average Medicare reimbursement rate of nearly 2.9%.Roto-Rooter reported sales of $250 million in the first quarter, up 7.9% year over year.Total Roto-Rooter branch commercial revenues improved 10.1% from the last year on a 4.0% increase in drain cleaning revenues, a 10.7% rise in commercial plumbing, 26.2% growth in excavation revenues and a 7.4% hike in commercial water restoration revenues.Total Roto-Rooter branch residential revenues registered 7.5% growth over the prior-year period on a 2.9% decrease in residential drain cleaning revenues, a 3.6% improvement in plumbing, a 3.9% increase in excavation and 27.4% growth in residential water restoration.Margins in DetailThe gross profit declined 2.3% year over year to $189.5 million in the first quarter of 2023. The gross margin contracted 274 basis points (bps) year over year to 33.8% due to an increase in the cost of products and services by 10.1% in the first quarter of 2023.The adjusted operating profit decreased 14% from the year-ago period to $189.4 million. The adjusted operating margin contracted 366 bps to 16% on an 11.3% increase in adjusted operating expenses.Story continuesLiquidity &amp; Capital StructureChemed exited the first quarter of 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $58.1 million, which marked a significant increase from $18.2 million at the end of 2022. Meanwhile, long-term debt at the end of the first quarter was $16.2 million compared with $120 million at the end of 2022.The cumulative net cash provided by operating activities at the end of the first quarter of 2023 was $60.5 million compared with $101.1 million in the year-ago period.During the quarter, the company paid off the majority of the $100 million amortizable term loan under its five-year $550 million Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (Credit Agreement). As of Mar 31, 2023, the remaining balance of the term loan stands at $21.3 million.Chemed has a consistent dividend-paying history, with the five-year annualized dividend growth being 6.24%.2023 GuidanceChemed expects to provide updated 2023 earnings guidance as part of the Jun 30, 2023, earnings release.On the fourth-quarter 2022 earnings call, CHE anticipated 2023 revenues from VITAS, prior to Medicare Cap, to increase in the range of 6-7% from the prior year (VITAS’ 2022 reported revenues totaled $1.20 billion, down 4.7% from the 2021 reported figure).Roto-Rooter is expected to achieve 2023 revenue growth in the range of 5-5.5% (Roto-Rooter’s reported revenues totaled $933.4 million in 2022, up 6.4% from the 2021 reported figure).The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 total revenues is pegged at $2.23 billion, suggesting 4.7% growth from the 2022 reported figure.For the full-year 2023, the adjusted EPS is estimated in the range of $20.7-$21.1 (adjusted EPS for 2022 came in at $16.72). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at $20.8, suggesting 5.6% growth over the 2022 adjusted figure.Our TakeChemed ended the first quarter of 2023 with both earnings and revenues missing estimates.On a positive note, the strong performance across both VITAS and Roto-Rooter drove the top line. Within the Roto-Rooter branch, the aggregate commercial and residential revenue growth was supported by substantial increases in commercial drain cleaning, plumbing, excavation and water restoration revenues in the quarter under review.Meanwhile, mounting costs and expenses weighed on the company’s margins. In the first quarter, 200 additional licensed healthcare staff were hired for the VITAS segment, which has negatively impacted margins by approximately 50 bps.Zacks Rank and Other Key PicksChemed currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation EW, Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

Think FAANG stocks and others. Today, investors aren’t nearly as quick to jump on the bandwagon of fast-growing disruptors. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t get exposure to companies innovating and changing their industries — It just means you have to be selective.Who are these companies? To help me decide which three stocks to include in this article, I will lean on the AB Disruptors ETF (NYSEARCA:FWD), a newly-launched fund from AllianceBernstein (NYSE:AB). InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAB Disruptors ETF was launched on March 22 and now has a tiny $8.2 million in net assets. Managed by portfolio manager Lei Qiu, the actively-managed ETF looks to hold 80-120 stocks. It looks for companies that have innovative, differentiated products and excellent management teams. FWD has 99 holdings, with its top 10 accounting for 20.36% of its portfolio. My selections will be companies disrupting industries from three sectors and in the fund’s top 10 holdings.   Nvidia (NVDA)Nvidia (NVDA) logo and sign on headquarters. Blurred foreground with green treesSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the ETF’s largest holding, weighted at 3.58%. NVDA stock is up 88.7% year-to-date.Analysts from Bank of America Corp. (NYSE:BAC) issued a note to clients on April 19 that suggested the artificial intelligence (AI) boom could be very good for NVDA. Having already almost doubled less than four months into the year, shareholders ought to be pretty happy about their situation.“Surging AI workloads in cloud/enterprise data centers could shift more computing horsepower/value towards specialized accelerators (such as NVDA Graphics Processing Units and custom chips from Broadcom/Marvell) and away from traditional x86-based INTC/AMD server CPUs,” Business Insider reported the comments of Vivek Arya, a senior analyst at BofA Securities.As a result of its premise that the demand for specialized accelerators could be greater than the traditional x86 processors, BofA raised its price target for NVDA from $310 to $340, considerably higher than its current share price of $270. Story continuesOf the 47 analysts covering NVDA, 34 rated it as Overweight with a median target price of $300. I’m a big believer in Nvidia CEO and co-founder Jensen Huang. As long as Huang runs the show, innovation will be a big part of the company’s DNA.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office. ISRG stock.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comIntuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) is the ETF’s 6th-largest holding, weighted at 1.69%. ISRG stock is up 13.11% year-to-date.I have recommended the da Vinci robotic surgical system maker twice before. I first recommended the stock in March 2013, suggesting that any slowdown in systems sales wouldn’t materialize. They didn’t. The company’s shares are up 500% since, despite a big comedown from the all-time high near $400 in December 2021.On April 19, ISRG stock gained 13% after reporting Q1 2023 earnings that were much better than analyst expectations. In addition, because it reported its biggest growth rate since mid-2021 of 26%, it raised its outlook for procedures in 2023 to 19.5% at the midpoint of its guidance, 550 basis points higher than its previous projections. “‘The first quarter results and commentary were very impressive, leaving us reinforced in our view Intuitive can sustain mid-teens revenue’ compounded annual growth rate, making it a standout in medtech,’ said Truist analyst, Richard Newitter. As a result, he reiterated his Buy rating and raised his target for price to $325 from $300 earlier,” Barron’s reported Newitter’s comments. Intuitive Surgical has been disrupting the healthcare industry for years. So no one should be surprised it remains a growth leader.   Booking Holdings (BKNG)The home page of the Internet booking of hotels booking.com on the screen the Chinese Xiaomi smartphone in male hand on a computer monitor. BKNG stock.Source: Andrey Solovev / ShutterstockBooking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) is the ETF’s 9th-largest holding, weighted at 1.6%. BKNG stock is up 31.86% year-to-date.“I’m fairly positive about the travel environment right now,” Barron’s reported Fogel’s February comments. “We had a very good 2022, and that momentum has carried into 2023.”My unscientific observations confirm Fogel’s comments.Seriously though, he’s right to call 2022 an exceptional year. Its revenue of $17.1 billion was 56% higher than a year ago, while its operating income, at $3.1 billion, was 162% higher than in 2021. Its free cash flow in 2022 was $6.19 billion, or 36.2% of its revenue, up from 23.0% in 2021. Based on a market cap of $101.3 billion, it has a free cash flow yield of 6.1%. Anything between 4% and 8% is a reasonable price. I’d look for Booking to leverage AI further to improve the customer experience. In March, Fogel wrote on LinkedIn that Booking had used AI for over a decade. However, it is approaching generative AI with cautious optimism. For now, it will tread slowly on this front.   On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis paper and packaging company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -56.4%.Revenues are expected to be $5.29 billion, down 1.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.75% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for WestRock?For WestRock, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +5.88%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that WestRock will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that WestRock would post earnings of $0.60 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.55, delivering a surprise of -8.33%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower.

This compares to earnings of $0.76 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 8.16%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this global paper and packaging company would post earnings of $0.69 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.87, delivering a surprise of 26.09%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.International Paper , which belongs to the Zacks Paper and Related Products industry, posted revenues of $5.02 billion for the quarter ended March 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.35%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $5.24 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.International Paper shares have lost about 0.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 5.6%.What's Next for International Paper?While International Paper has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for International Paper: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.84 on $5 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $2.84 on $19.96 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Paper and Related Products is currently in the bottom 28% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.One other stock from the same industry, WestRock (WRK), is yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2023.

Reported EPS is $0.62 EPS, expectations were $0.66.Operator Good morning, and welcome to the Regions Financial Corporation’s Quarterly Earnings Call. My name is Christine, and I will be your operator for today’s call. [Operator Instructions]I will now turn the call over to Dana Nolan to begin.Dana Nolan Thank you, Christine. Welcome to Regions first quarter 2023 earnings call. John and David will provide high-level commentary regarding the quarter. Earnings documents, which include our forward-looking statement disclaimer and non-GAAP information are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. These disclosures cover our presentation materials, prepared comments and Q&amp;A.I will now turn the call over to John.John Turner Thank you, Dana, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our call today.Once again, Regions delivered another solid quarter, underscoring our commitment to generating consistent, sustainable long-term performance.We generated earnings of $588 million, resulting in earnings per share of $0.62. Despite recent events in the banking industry, we remain focused on the fundamentals and things we can control.We’ve spent over a decade enhancing our interest rate risk, credit risk, capital and liquidity management frameworks. Our relationship-based banking approach, coupled with our favorable geographic footprint uniquely positions us to weather an uncertain market backdrop.Further, balance and diversity on both sides of the balance sheet have been a key focus for years. As a result, we are well positioned to withstand an array of economic conditions. Approximately 70% of our deposits are retail deposits. These deposits tend to be granular and less rate sensitive.In fact, approximately 90% of these deposits are insured.Our strategy focuses on primacy and customer loyalty. We want to be our customers’ primary banking relationship. This strategy is evident in the fact that over 90% of our consumer checking households include a high-quality checking account, and over 60% of consumer checking deposit balances are with customers that have been with regions for 10 years or more.Our wholesale or business services deposits are also highly diversified from an industry, size and geography perspective, with approximately 75% of deposits that are either insured, operational in nature or collateralized. In total, approximately 75% of our deposits across all business lines are insured or collateralized by securities and our deposits are with customers we know is over 97% reside within our 15-state footprint.Further supporting our high-quality deposit franchise, we had access to total primary liquidity of approximately $41 billion at the end of the quarter, sufficient to cover uninsured retail and nonoperational wholesale deposits by more than a 2:1 ratio.Story continuesIf you include access to Federal Reserve discount window, available liquidity increases to $54 billion or approximately 3:1 coverage. We have a strong team of bankers and the recent disruption has given us an opportunity to connect with our customers and top prospects to answer questions and reassure them of our stability. We’ve experienced some deposit outflows as corporate treasuries look to diversify and sought higher interest rates for their excess cash. However, we’ve also experienced deposit inflows from new and existing customers.Importantly, our total deposits at March 31st were roughly unchanged from what they were prior to the onset of liquidity concerns in the industry. The majority of the $3 billion deposit decrease this quarter was as expected, due primarily to further normalization in corporate deposits, which had dramatically increased during the pandemic, as well as the continuation of rate-seeking behavior in certain wealth and higher balance consumer accounts.From a lending perspective, our focus on risk-adjusted returns continues.Overall sentiment among our corporate customers remains positive. While most are forecasting strong performance in 2023, they are expecting modest declines from levels seen in 2022. While current market conditions warrant heightened caution, we believe our strong liquidity profile provides an advantage in terms of supporting our customers’ borrowing needs.In closing, despite all the industry turmoil, we feel very good about our balance sheet and strong liquidity position. And through our proactive hedging strategies, we are positioned for success in any interest rate environment. Our granular deposit base and relationship-based banking model continue to serve us well, and we’re proud to continue supporting our customers’ banking needs.Now, David will provide some highlights regarding the quarter.David Turner Thank you, John.Let’s start with the balance sheet.Average loans increased 2% sequentially. Average business loans increased 2% compared to the prior quarter, reflecting high-quality, broad-based growth across the utilities, retail trade and financial services industries. Approximately 87% of this growth was again driven by existing clients accessing and expanding their credit lines to rebuild inventories and expand their businesses.Average consumer loans increased 1% as growth in mortgage and Interbank was partially offset by continued pay-downs in home equity and runoff exit portfolios. Looking forward, we continue to expect 2023 ending loan growth of approximately 4%.From a deposit standpoint, our deposit base remains a strength and competitive advantage with balances continuing to largely perform as expected.Previously, we indicated that combination of rapidly rising interest rates and normalization of surge deposits would likely lead to $3 billion to $5 billion of deposit declines by midyear before we would begin to generate net deposit growth.While the events in March created turmoil in the banking industry, we continue to believe that range is appropriate. However, we may be at the higher end of the range as we approach midyear.The preponderance of deposit outflows this quarter occurred prior to early March and were in line with our expectations. Approximately $2 billion of the $3 billion outflow came from corporate deposits, reflecting normal seasonal activity. The other $1 billion came from a continuation of rate-seeking behavior among certain wealth and higher balance consumer clients.The same characteristics that contribute to our deposit advantage in a rising rate environment are also helpful in a time of systemic volatility.As John noted, our focus on attracting and retaining a diverse and granular deposit base with high primacy drives loyalty and trust and instills funding stability. So, let’s shift to net interest income and margin.Net interest income continued to expand with market interest rates in the first quarter, reflecting our asset-sensitive profile and funding stability. Net interest income grew 1% linked quarter to a record $1.4 billion and net interest margin increased 23 basis points to 4.22%. As the Federal Reserve nears the end of its tightening cycle, net interest income is supported by elevated floating rate loan and cash yields at higher market interest rates and fixed rate asset turnover from the maturity of low-yielding loans and securities generated through the pandemic.At this stage in the rate cycle, we expect accelerating deposit costs through repricing and remixing Importantly, recent trends remain within our expectation.The cycle-to-date deposit beta is 19%, and our guidance for 2023 is unchanged, a 35% full-cycle beta by year-end. We remain confident that our deposit composition will provide a meaningful competitive advantage for Regions when compared to the broader industry.Net interest income is projected to grow between 12% and 14% in 2023 when compared to 2022. The midpoint of the range is supported by the March 31st market forward yield curve, which projects nearly 75 basis points of rate cuts in 2023. A stable Fed funds level would push net interest income to the upper end of the range.The balance sheet hedging program is an important source of our earnings stability in today’s uncertain environment. Hedges added to date create a well-protected net interest margin profile through 2025.Forward starting received fixed swaps will become effective in the latter half of 2023 and 2024 and generally have a term of three years. Activity in the first quarter focused on extending that protection beyond 2025.In addition to forward starting swaps, we added a $1.5 billion collar strategy, selling rate caps to pay for rate floors to limit exposure to extreme market rate movements. The resulting balance sheet is constructed to support a net interest margin range of 3.6% to 4% over the coming years, even if interest rates move back towards 1%. If rates remain elevated, our net interest margin is projected to remain above the high end of the range until deposits fully reprice.So, let’s take a look at fee revenue and expense. Adjusted noninterest income declined 3% from the prior quarter as modest increases in service charges and wealth management income were offset by declines in other categories, primarily capital markets and card and ATM fees.Service charges increased slightly as seasonally higher treasury management fees offset declines in overdraft fees.Excluding the impact of CVA and DVA, capital markets increased 4% sequentially as growth in real estate capital markets, loan syndications, and debt and securities underwriting more than offset declines in M&amp;A fees and commercial swaps. We did have a negative $33 million CVA and DVA adjustment, reflecting lower long-term interest rates, volatility in credit spreads as well as a refinement in our valuation methodology. Card and ATM fees were negatively impacted by a $5 million increase in reserves, driven by higher reward redemption rates.With respect to our outlook, and incorporating first quarter results, we expect full year 2023 adjusted total revenue to be up 6% to 8% compared to 2022.Let’s move on to noninterest expense.Adjusted noninterest expenses increased 1% compared to the prior quarter. Salaries and benefits increased 2%, primarily due to merit and a seasonal increase in payroll taxes. FDIC insurance assessment reflects the previously announced industry-wide increase in the assessment rate schedules.In contrast to the prior two years, we expect first half 2023 adjusted expenses to be higher than the second half of the year. And we continue to expect full year 2023 adjusted noninterest expenses to be up 4.5% to 5.5%. We now expect to generate positive adjusted operating leverage of approximately 2%.From an asset quality standpoint, overall credit performance continues to normalize as expected. Net charge-offs were 35 basis points in the quarter. Nonperforming loans and business services criticized loans increased while total delinquencies decreased.Provision expense was $135 million, while the allowance for credit loss ratio remained unchanged at 1.63%.The amount of the allowance increased due primarily to economic changes and normalizing credit from historically low levels, partially offset by a reduction associated with the elimination of the accounting for troubled debt restructured loans. It is worth noting the outcome of the most recent Shared National Credit exam is reflected in our results.I want to take a few minutes to speak to our commercial real estate portfolio. Since 2008, we have deliberately limited our exposure to this space. At quarter-end, our exposure totaled 15% of loans, excluding owner-occupied and it is highly diverse. This total includes $8.4 billion of investor real estate and $6.7 billion of unsecured exposure, of which the vast majority is within real estate investment trust.Our REIT clients generally have low leverage and strong access to liquidity with 68% classified as investment grade.Importantly, total office represents just 1.8% of total loans at $1.8 billion. Of note, 83% consist of Class A properties with 62% located within the Sunbelt. The office portfolio was originated with an approximate weighted average loan-to-value of 58% and we have stressed the portfolio to include a 25% discount using the Green Street commercial property price index with the weighted average resulting loan-to-value of the book approximating 77%.It is also noteworthy that 37% of our secured office portfolio is single tenant. While we are carefully monitoring conditions, we believe our portfolio will be able to weather the weakness in the industry.Including first quarter results, we now expect our full year 2023 net charge-off ratio to be approximately 35 basis points.Given the recent economic uncertainty and market volatility, we may see a pickup in the pace of normalization towards our through-the-cycle annual charge-off range of 35 to 45 basis points over time.From a capital standpoint, we ended the quarter with a common equity Tier 1 ratio at an estimated 9.8%, reflecting solid capital generation through earnings, partially offset by continued loan growth and approximately $100 million or 7 basis points related to the phase-in of CECL into regulatory capital. Given current macroeconomic conditions, and regulatory uncertainty, we anticipate managing capital levels at or modestly above 10% over the near term.So, in closing, we delivered solid results in the first quarter despite volatile conditions. We have balance and diversity on both sides of the balance sheet and are well positioned to withstand an array of economic conditions.We are in some of the strongest markets in the country. And while we remain vigilant to indicators of potential market contraction, we will continue to be a source of stability to our customers.Pretax pre-provision income remained strong. Expenses are well controlled. Credit remains broadly stable, and capital and liquidity levels remain robust.With that, we’ll move to the Q&amp;A portion of the call.See also 20 Biggest Power Generation Companies in the World and 16 Largest Grocery Chains in the World.Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions]Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.Ryan Nash David, maybe a question on betas and deposit balances. So, you guys are one of the few that isn’t increasing your deposit beta guidance given that you’re at 19% and I think expectations are for 35%. Can you maybe just talk about where you expect the pressure to come from?I think you noted in the remarks, repricing and remixing, how much will each of these contribute? Are you expecting more to be in retail given the push for insured deposits, or is it on the commercial side?And then second, you noted that you do expect to see stabilization of growth in balances later in the year. Can you maybe just talk about what you see driving that as we move through the year? Thanks.David Turner Sure. So, as we’ve mentioned before, we had $41 billion worth of surge deposits. We didn’t think those would stay with us as long as they actually have stayed with us. And we furthermore said as rates continue to increase that people would be seeking higher returns than we were offering at the time. And so you can see our cumulative beta, as you mentioned, at 19%, well below everybody else.We do understand that we’re going to end up -- there’s going to be a shift of deposits into CDs, more expensive deposits. And so, we do also expect some continued runoff. We had given you the guide of $3 billion to $5 billion. We’re down $3.3 billion. We expect to be at the upper end of that by the end of the second quarter. And a lot of that is putting money to work and businesses, but also some seeking higher rates.And so, the combination of where we are relative to our deposit costs relative to the peers would imply that we would be increasing some of that over time, and that’s going to drive our beta, and we still believe 35% is the right number by the end of the cycle, which we’re calling the end of this year.Ryan Nash Got it.And maybe as a follow-up, so you guys are now expecting losses at the high end of your previous guidance. It looks like the increase this quarter was driven by C&amp;I. And I think, David, I think you just noted you could see a pickup in the pace of normalization. Can you maybe just talk about, one, what is driving the incremental pressure? And what are you expecting to be the higher driver of charge-offs, both for the rest of this year and then the pace of normalization that we could see? Thanks.David Turner Well, so as we’ve stated many times, the charge-off level is below normal. And that we said it would be normalizing over time. We’ve furthermore set our normalized loss rate based on the risk profile we maintained as 35 to 45. As we get through the end of this year, we’re trying to give you the message that that could kind of lead you into a run rate towards that 35 to 45 by the end of the year.We’re already at 35 this quarter, which would imply we expect a reduction in charge-offs in the second and/or third quarter. But all in, we still think we’re going to be at 35 basis points, which is below normal. So, we have a lot of confidence in that. We had certain things that happened in the first quarter, we don’t think will repeat. And so I think our 35 is a pretty good number.John Turner Yes. Ryan, I’d just add to the question about where we’re seeing the stress. We’ve identified a couple of areas on previous calls where we are experiencing some stress in the portfolio. That would be healthcare, where we’re seeing rising costs and pressure on labor. Transportation, particularly on the smaller end of the transportation sector where customers are competing in the spot market to move product.Consumer discretionary, where consumers are changing their buying patterns and moving away from more discretionary items towards services where we’re seeing some pressure; office, obviously; and then senior housing, which is a sector that we believe is improving but still not return to occupancy levels that we experienced prior to the pandemic. And again, it’s a sector where labor is a factor in the operations of those businesses and driving cost up. So, those are all areas where we are seeing more pressure than in the rest of the portfolio.And I would finally comment, I think we’ll see some additional, quote, movement toward normalization. But, we’ve probably gotten there a little faster than I think we thought we would. So, we don’t expect a whole lot of additional deterioration as we move towards normalization.Operator Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS.Erika Najarian My first question is for David.You continue to have that long -- I think about a long-term NIM of 3.6% to 4%. I think investors are starting to think about rates cut in 2024. And I’m low to always ask about 2024, but I think investors are thinking about how inexpensive bank stocks are really, right, trying to evaluate them on what could be trough earnings next year. So, if the Fed cuts, can you still stay within that range? And I think nobody is expecting a cut to zero, but perhaps walk us through the scenario of that range in the scenario of like a 200 basis-point cut over one year?David Turner Yes. So, the bottom line answer is yes, we do feel comfortable under any scenario. As we mentioned that we would operate in that 3.60% to 4% range. Clearly, our guidance is based on the market.I mean, on the March 31st forward, it has three cuts, 75 basis points worth of cuts after one increase. So, to the extent that were to happen, we will still be within that range. If it stays higher than that, then we’d be at the upper end of the range.And we have some received fixed swaps that actually come on board in the second half of the year to protect us from lower rates. We’re not saying that the rates will be cut. That’s what the market says. I personally don’t see that that will happen at that pace. But we wanted to be able to center the discussion on what the market is saying, and that’s why we gave you that and then we gave you some sensitivity around it. So, we feel very good about the range.Where we are in the range? There are a whole lot of factors.The pace, the timing of cuts would take us down, even if we had a couple of hundred basis points of cuts, then ‘24, we’re still in the range. So, does that get you what you wanted?Erika Najarian Yes. And as we think about perhaps a more measured pace of cut, how would you anticipate being able to normalize your deposit costs in that backdrop?David Turner Say that again. How would we -- say that again, Erika.Erika Najarian Yes. How quickly could you lower deposit costs in an environment where the Fed is cutting in a measured pace? I’m just trying to think about the other side as I think about your -- sort of your long-term NIM target range?David Turner Yes. Well, so you can see our deposit cost relative to our peers is 19% fair are lagging.And so, the ability to cut, we have to be competitive. We have to offer a fair price to our customer base. And I think to the extent you start seeing a pause and/or cuts coming from the Fed, the beta that we just mentioned could change and may not be as severe. What happens is the increase in deposit cost lagged the last increase of -- that the Fed is going to have. So, it will take some time for that to manifest itself.So, if you look at the retail side, the retail side is very slow to react. But on the commercial side, it’s almost instantaneous as treasurers look to lock in the best yield that they can. We have some index deposits that move with changes in Fed funds. So that will react pretty quickly, which I think is a benefit to us in that scenario.Operator Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore.John Pancari In terms of your maintaining the cumulative or through-cycle beta at 35%, I hear you where you’re trending down 19% in your confidence.But I’m just curious how the liquidity crisis through March and how it really impacted that outlook. We saw a number of of other banks increased their deposit beta expectations given the intensifying pressure around deposit costs as well as broader funding costs. So, how has the liquidity crisis impacted your view? And how does that not influence an increase in how you’re thinking about the through-cycle beta? If you could just walk us through that.David Turner Yes, John. So our -- this is -- our competitive advantage is our deposit base. And so we haven’t had to react at the pace at others. So if you look at the incremental beta of our core peer group, that was some 73% this quarter and ours was 40%, 41%. So we just haven’t had to move at the pace and I still think based on how we fund ourselves, the core retail, 70% of our deposits being retail really has helped us from being able to keep that beta where it is at 35%.So, as we think about some of the larger customers that are seeking rates, seeking returns, that’s where there’s been more competitive pressure and we saw some of that being put to work in the first quarter.And we called for some of that. That’s part of the $3 billion to $5 billion that we’re talking about. As a matter of fact, in our beta assumption, we had all that coming out of noninterest bearing. That wasn’t quite what we saw, but we gave it -- we assumed noninterest-bearing because that was more conservative to give you the guidance.And so if you take all that into consideration, I think that’s why you didn’t see us change our cumulative basis of 35%. And being at 19%, there’s a long way to go from 19% to 35%. We understand that, but if we miss it, maybe it’s a tad underneath that, which is why we gave you also some guidance on our slide number 7, that would show you if beta was a little bit better than 35%, how much it might mean.John Pancari Got it.Thanks, David. That’s helpful. And then, separately, on the capital front, I know you increased your target to 10% -- and so just -- or 10% or just above, I believe you said. If you could maybe give us a little bit more color in terms of the rationale. And then, could that allow for buybacks at some point? How are you thinking about deployment and the pace of where you -- the timing of when you get to around that 10% range?David Turner Sure. So, you saw our common equity Tier 1 increase from 9.6% to 9.8%, and that’s after absorbing about 7 basis points due to the CECL impact for the first quarter. So, we’re generating 20 to 30 basis points worth of CET1 every quarter. After loan growth, we first and foremost want to be here as a source of strength for our customers and be able to make all creditworthy loans we can make.And we’re open for business and ready to do that.That’s what our job is. We want to make sure we pay our shareholders a fair dividend, 35% to 45% of our earnings in the form of a dividend, and we have been at the lower end of that. But -- and then we’ve used our capital for other nonbank acquisitions and mortgage servicing right acquisitions, which we’d like to continue. And then to optimize our capital, we’ll buy stock back from time to time.Given the uncertainty that’s in the market, obviously, there’s a lot of review going on to what happened in the month of March, and there’s going to be some reports coming out from our regulatory supervisors on what may change. And we just want to be prepared for that, and we think it would be inappropriate at this time to be buying our stock back when we have this kind of uncertainty.You’ll lop on top of that the uncertainty in the economy and monetary policy. So there’s just a lot of noise, which caused us to rethink, let’s just wait, let us accrete up to that 10%, maybe slightly over that. And to the extent things settle down, then we’ll optimize capital, and we’ll use share repurchases as a mechanism to do so.Operator Our next question comes from the line of Matt O’Connor with Deutsche Bank.Matt O’Connor How are you thinking about managing liquidity going forward? Obviously, like with a very strong deposit base, you’ve been less reliant on wholesale borrowing. But both in light of current conditions and then just kind of the way the regulation might be moving, what are you thinking about in terms of borrowings and then also both cash and securities?And again, like you’ve got a smaller AFS book than others, which has worked well given the moving rates. But what’s the outlook on both the funding and asset side? Thanks.David Turner Yes. So, we still believe in growing customer relationships, core checking accounts and operating accounts of businesses. It’s the basis of our whole business, and we’ll continue to do that from -- to help us from a liquidity standpoint. Clearly, some things have changed. We’ve given you a list of our total primary liquidity and also liquidity at the discount window, should we need it. What we’ve learned, I think, over this, is that it can move much quicker that we all had anticipated the world has changed a bit.And so, we’ve had one of the largest cash balances of anybody in the peer group, the lower securities book.And we did that intentionally because we were not clear on the surge deposits on the pace that they would move out. So, we’ll probably maintain a bit more cash than we historically have been. Obviously, there’s -- currently, there’s a new term bank facility that the Fed created that’s temporary. I hope there’s some thinking about how to maybe keep some of that in place. But we did not use that, as you can tell from our disclosures. But we tested it after quarter end, just to make sure the pipes were worked up, and I think we borrowed $1,000 and repaid it quickly. But posting collateral to something like that, that you can get access to quickly. Clearly, the Federal Home Loan Bank is still our primary source we go to. We have a little bit outstanding there at quarter end, a couple of billion dollars.And so, just having access to multiple levels -- if we learned anything, it’s diversification.And you need to make sure your funding side is diverse. And within your deposit base, it needs to be diverse. So if you end up with a concentration, you end up with a problem. So I think that’s a big lesson learned for everybody and staying as diverse, so we can a little more cash on hand I think, is in order.Matt O’Connor And then specifically on the securities book, how would you think about that relative to assets kind of near or longer term with the current framework?David Turner We’ve historically been in that 20% range of earning assets, and we don’t see that changing dramatically. I think we need to be careful. There’s been a lot of discussion about shortening up maturities and things of that nature. And we need to be real careful because there could be broad implications of that.The banking system is a big buyer of mortgage-backed securities, and we need to support the mortgage industry and the housing industry and consumers that way. So, we are forced to go too short. There are much broader implications to the economy. So we’re going to be careful of that. We’ll see what the policymakers come up with and we’ll adapt and overcome as we see fit. But right now, I think having a book about where we’ve been, which is a little lower than others, I think, is the right spot for us based on our -- again, our funding profile. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.Gerard Cassidy John or David, or both of you, obviously, Regions has derisked its balance sheet dramatically from the ‘08, ‘09 time period.And so, I think you guys are in a good position to maybe handle this question, specifically for commercial real estate. Can you guys share with us the differences that you are seeing in the current commercial real estate market in your portfolio versus what it was like in ‘08, ‘09. Now granted, I know you’ve lowered the exposure. So, that’s a major difference. But in terms of the cap rates, obviously, have moved up, the refinancing risk is here. But can you share with us how you guys could handle that more -- I’m assuming more easily today than what happened in ‘08, ‘09.John Turner Yes. Gerard, this is John. I would say we rebuilt our business beginning in kind of the ‘09, ‘10 time frame, recognizing that it’s very much a specialized business.And we’ve built it around professional real estate bankers who are working with professional real estate developers. Generally, they are either regional or national developers. They have strong capital positions, good access to liquidity, strong track records. They’re operating in some of the primary markets across the U.S.We rebuilt our business with a focus on concentration risk management. So it’s well distributed, portfolio is across different segments of the industry as well as across geographies. We have built a business, I think, very conservatively from a structural standpoint requiring good equity in projects. And we’re constantly stressing our exposure. It’s a relationship business for us. We’re transacting with customers who maintain deposit relationships with us who use our capital markets capabilities.We’re very close to those customers. And as a consequence, I think we have a very good handle on the exposure that we have across the business.And we have the benefit of operating in some of the best markets in the country as well. If you look at markets like Dallas and Houston, Orlando, Charlotte, Atlanta and Nashville, where we’re doing business and where the majority of our portfolio resides, we have good underpinning economy to help support the projects as well.Gerard Cassidy And maybe, David, on a technical question regarding the commercial real estate, how does the elimination of TDRs now help or hinder you’re guys working out with some of your customers that may inevitably have an issue with their property?David Turner Well, we’re not going to let an accounting change, change or what we’re going to do for our customer.If we need to have a restructuring, then that’s what we’ll do. And we’ll let the accounting is what it is. So I don’t think that will impact us at all, Gerard, from moving forward just like we always have.Gerard Cassidy Very good. And then just as a follow-up question, another technical one for you, David. Can you just remind us about the CECL being phased into capital, just the time range and how that may affect your capital ratios going forward?David Turner It’s roughly the same number you just saw. It’s almost a straight line number over, I think, it’s four periods. So we’ve got more of these coming. It’s $100 million in round numbers, Gerard, in the first quarter of each of the next three years, about 7 points -- I’m sorry, two more years.And so, it will be about a 7 basis-point hit to us each of the next two years.Operator Our next question comes from the line of Peter Winter with D.A. Davidson.Peter Winter You guys had pretty solid average loan growth this quarter and did maintain the period-end outlook. Can you just talk about loan demand? And then, secondly, if there’s any areas maybe where you’re tightening underwriting standards or being more selective at this stage?John Turner Yes. So, we -- obviously, in this economy, we want to be thoughtful about any new relationships that we acquire and any new credit that we book. I think I would like to think that we’re not changing our underwriting standards that they are consistent across all economic cycles. But at the same time, when you think about allocation of capital and lending into this environment, we want to be thoughtful and prudent.We want to make sure that any new business we get as a result of calling activity that’s been ongoing for some time.We understand the relationship potential and opportunity that we have a good plan. The bulk of the loan growth that we’ve experienced in the wholesale business has been loans to existing customers. And in the last quarter, a good bit of the growth was in our industry verticals, particularly in power and utilities, energy and the industrial space.We’re also seeing a little growth within our Regions Business Capital business, asset-based lending business during this period of time. And then on the consumer side, mortgage grew and Interbank grew as a result of putting mortgage because we’re generating some arms during the period -- on balance sheet arms in a period like this. I think loan growth, clearly, our loan pipelines, I should say, on the wholesale side of the business are down.And I think that reflects caution on the part of customers as well as projects, just the economy is slowing a bit as a result of rising rates and increasing cost.We still believe, given sort of our view of the future and known projects that are either underway or will get underway, there is -- we have an opportunity to grow loans. I think we’re guiding to about 4% between now and end of the year and should see growth in the same categories that I just described.David Turner I think, Peter, I’ll add to that, as part of the growth outlook, because of the markets that we operate in, we’ve been the recipient of a lot of migration of people and businesses into where we operate. And so, our economy here is a bit different than certain other economies around the country. And I think that’s given us some confidence that our 4% loan growth is reasonable.Peter Winter Got it. Very helpful. And if I could ask about the guidance on the deposit service charges, still $550 million.Question is how should we think about the second half of the year from the impact of that grace period? Will it step down to, I guess, around $120 million. And could you offset some of that with just account growth and cross-selling treasury management services?David Turner Yes. So, you can see that our -- if you annualize where we ended up in the first quarter, we would be above the $550 million, and that’s an acknowledgment that our last change of 24-hour grace actually goes in the beginning of the second -- of the third quarter. And so you’re going to see that step down more so in the third and fourth quarter than you have seen because we haven’t made the change.One of the things that we’ve been -- the recipients of is our treasury management investments we’ve made on people and technology have really helped offset to some degree at least, the decline we’re seeing from the consumer service charges, and we expect that to continue.So, we’re up some 8% there in TM. And if this continues at that pace, we might have a better answer for you next earnings call. But right now, we’re calling for $550 million and with a step down in the second half of the year.Operator Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.Ken Usdin Just a follow-up also on the fee side. I know, obviously, it’s been a tougher start to the year in capital markets and you’re reiterating that 60 to 80 zones that you kind of were in, in the first quarter. Just maybe you give us color on just how the business is feeling and acting in terms of pipelines and expectations and whether or not you anticipate there being a -- is there a bounce built into your expectation in the second half?Thanks.John Turner Yes. We do, Ken, expect the business to pick up in the second half of the year. It’s still I would say, modestly improving, but the second quarter will probably look a lot like the first is our guess. Our business is -- a good bit of our business is built around real estate capital markets and our real estate customers, and that business has just been really, really slow.If you look at the component parts of our business, generally speaking, whether it’s syndication revenue, revenue generated from fixed income placement or derivative sales, has been pretty good over the course of the first quarter. But real estate capital markets has been very soft. M&amp;A was pretty good in the first quarter. We expect that to be true through the balance of the year.So I think we’re guiding to pick up in the second half of the year, and we believe that’s very possible.David Turner And just for clarification, make sure, Ken, that and John said you should expect the second quarter to look like the first quarter. That’s ex CVA, DVA. So, we’re talking about the flower in the -- probably in the middle of the 60 to 80 range is about where we would expect that. And we don’t expect to have a CVA, DVA adjustment quite as volatile as you just saw this quarter.Ken Usdin I appreciate that. Yes. And second question, just on the loan side. As far as the outlook goes, when you think about just the combination of either your supply of credit and the demand of credit in this changing environment that we’re in, just what’s happening on the lending side of things in terms of how the environment is changing that?Are you guys tightening up at all? Is it more about the end client that’s changing their demand functions?John Turner Well, naturally, in a softening economy, if you will, we are going to probably be a little more conservative, even though I would say that we like to -- as I said a few minutes ago, we like to think that our underwriting standards don’t change from economic period to economic period. We are in some very good markets, as David pointed out, and while pipelines are softer, we see people that are -- still have opportunities. We want to be smart about client selectivity all the time, probably even more so during periods like this. We want to support our existing customers and some 90 -- almost 85% of -- in round numbers of loan growth we’ve experienced in the last quarter was to existing customers.So, we are acquiring some new customers but being very thoughtful about that.And then separately, while our economies are good, and we do see some opportunity, pipelines are down because of, I think, customer caution related to still difficulty acquiring labor. There are two open jobs in the Southeast for every one person looking for a job. So labor market is still tight. And costs, while moderating, have risen fairly significantly, including interest costs, obviously, which puts pressure on projects.So I think for the balance of the year, we’ll probably see pipelines will have moderated and stay fairly muted, but we believe we can deliver the loan growth that we’re projecting, despite that.Operator Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.Betsy Graseck In the past, you’ve talked a little bit about the fact that you’re not going to need debt financing for, I don’t know, several quarters.And I just wanted to see if you could give us an update on how you’re thinking about that, especially as you -- even though your size doesn’t come into the current TLAC expectations there is the potential for that to happen over time. And I wanted to hear how you’re thinking about that. Thanks.David Turner Yes. So from a debt financing standpoint, we borrowed a little bit from the FHLB as you saw. But the larger term financing, we said we’d push off probably until the second half of the year. We don’t know what the regime is going to be, if there will be any change pushed down to us from a TLAC standpoint. At some point, whether we had that or not, we need some more term financing, some term debt that we’ll put on. And so, I think that we can make sure we deal with that over time.Betsy, I would say that the changes that are at least being bandied around right now.You can’t move too fast because we all can’t go out there and raise a bunch of debt at the same time. It would be tough for the market to absorb. So I think any change that might be coming relative to that would be over time. And I still think there’s going to be some tailoring. What that looks like, what that means, we’ll have to find out to with our regulatory supervisors and policymakers decide. But outside of something like that, and we have a little bit of term debt that we need to get done, and that’s really pointed towards the back half of this year. And that’s included in our guidance.Betsy Graseck Right. And that was something that you had been talking about for a while. Just wondering if it’s feasible to give us a sense as to size, if that’s reasonable or not?David Turner No, we haven’t done that yet.So, we’re still working out what that needs to look like and precise timing, too. But we don’t expect it this first half of the year.Betsy Graseck Okay. And then separately, could you just give us a sense on the expense outlook that you’ve got for 2023, the kinds of levers that you have to keep the expense guide in the range that you’ve got 4.5 to 5.5, and if there’s anything in particular that you could point us to in terms of opportunities for efficiency improvements from here? Thanks.David Turner Yes. It’s a great question. And we tried to -- not tried, we gave guidance that our first quarter was going to be a high watermark. I’m not sure that made it into everybody’s expectations, but it is what it is. We’ve now given you guidance again that we think the first half of the year will be higher than the second half of the year.We had some things that we knew were coming in the first half, including we moved our merit month, our merit increase up a month from April to March. So you’ve seen that in our first quarter.And any event, I think when you look at the way to work on expenses, the first thing are salaries and benefits and making sure that you’ve got the right people, right number of the right people doing the right things. And I think that’s always a challenge and we continue to look at process improvement, leveraging technology so that when we have attrition, natural attrition, perhaps we don’t have to backfill as people if we can move that at the same time.We’ve looked at our occupancy. I do think return to work is still trying to find its way and -- but we likely have more square footage than we need, whether it be in the branch space or the office space.And so, we have a team constantly working on square footage, which is our second highest cost. From a technology standpoint, we’re having to make room to go through our transformation we’re working on right now. And so, those costs are going up, and we’re able to have cuts in other places to pay for it.Vendor spend is another area where we really make sure that we limit our use of consultants or contracts with vendors. We just make sure we get the best deal we can, and we have a team working on that. So there is a cost pool in this company and that’s not going to go through some type of challenge during this year because you don’t have a tailwind in ‘24 for rates. So, you’ve got to do -- start working on your expenses today to help ‘24, and we’re doing that.And so, we have pretty good confidence in our expense number that 4.5% to 5.5% right now for this year.Operator Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Stephen Scouten with Piper Sandler.Stephen Scouten I just wanted to ask a little bit about the adjusted revenue guidance. Obviously, I can appreciate that would be down a little bit given the funding pressures industry-wide. But as I look at your results from this quarter, it kind of feels like they were within guidance from last quarter and the NIM was exceptionally high. So, it just feels like you might be ahead of schedule versus having to pair that guidance back. So, I’m wondering if you can walk me through the main drivers of that reduction.David Turner Well, there are two primary drivers.The first is we used in our guidance the March 31st forward curve that had 75 basis points worth of cuts in the year with one increase. So you’re down into the 450 range by the end of the year. So we then tried to sensitize that. We told you if that wouldn’t quite there, how much that may mean. And you can see that on page 7 of the deck. So that was number one.Number two, we just had -- our capital markets was down quite a bit in the first quarter, primarily driven by -- or at least a good portion of it driven by the CVA/DVA adjustment. We don’t think that will repeat at that level, but nonetheless, it’s in the number. And so, you’re already down that. So, we didn’t carve that out as an adjusted item. That’s in our core number.Some people adjust and some people don’t. What we do is provide that and let you do what you want with it. But when we’re giving you guidance is in our number -- in our core number.And so, those are the two big drivers -- we’ve already given you guidance that our service charge number is likely to go down because we’re going to offer up 24-hour grace, and we’re not exactly sure what that will mean, but we’ve taken an estimate, and we’ve given you the $550 million for service charges and we’ll update as we learn. But those are probably the big three.Stephen Scouten Okay. Very helpful, David. And then I guess just one maybe high-level kind of question. I mean, it feels like your business model is really proving itself out right now.I mean, you’re in just a phenomenal position from a deposit perspective and you’ve diversified your loan book so much over the last few years. I guess, as you look at the environment today, is there anything you would have done differently or anything you would have structured differently, knowing what, I guess, we’ve learned since March 8th or what have you? Or do you feel like you’ve done what you would have wanted to do regardless?David Turner Stephen, I think we really -- our core of our franchise are our customers and the people that work here, and we have a fabulous customer base, deposit base. We’ve said that for many, many years, even when rates were zero -- virtually zero. And you didn’t see the benefit of that. Rising rates and of course, having a liquidity challenges all proves the business model out.So, we certainly wouldn’t change that, and we wouldn’t change our focus on thinking of a customer on the right side of the balance sheet in the form of a checking account or an operating account, that’s really worked well for us. We brought on some really talented people in our company, in particular, our technology area. We brought on some very good people in the revenue areas that are doing a great job for us.And so, I just think sticking to fundamentals of banking is what we’ve done. That’s what John has asked us to do. We’re not trying to take big bets on anything. We’re just trying to keep it down the fairway. And to me, steady as she goes, has been the way and may not be flashy, but it seems to be paying off for us. And I think if we just stay on that, soundness; profitability; and growth, those are the three words John asked us to use in that order.And if we stick to that, we’re going to have a pretty good franchise. It’s going to be less volatile than many of our peers and certainly less volatile than we used to be pre-crisis.So, I don’t see a lot of change. We need to get better in leverage technology in some areas where we’re using human capital, and that’s just -- that’s on the to-do list, and we’re trying to get after it.John Turner Thank you. Well, I know it’s been a busy week for everybody. I appreciate your participation today, and thank you for your interest in Regions. We’ll end the call. Thanks very much.Operator Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.]"

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230427005091/en/Ginger Donohue, manager of Regions’ Beechwood branch in Vicksburg, Mississippi, is the first recipient of the bank’s newly launched Lee Ann Petty Heart of Service Award. (Photo: Business Wire)Designed as Regions’ highest associate honor for community engagement, the Lee Ann Petty Heart of Service Award recognizes exemplary volunteerism that goes above and beyond in supporting the quality of life in communities served by the bank. Longtime Regions associate Lee Ann Petty served as volunteer services coordinator in Regions’ Community Affairs division. She passed away on Dec. 30, 2020, following a courageous battle against cancer.Yet her sincere commitment to serving others continues to inspire thousands of Regions associates in several states.And because of her own incredible dedication to making a positive impact, Regions is proud to honor Ginger Donohue with the inaugural award that pays tribute to Petty’s legacy.""No matter where you look, you will be hard pressed to find anyone who pours more of their heart into serving others than Ginger,"" said Wendi Boyen, community advocacy and financial wellness manager for Regions. ""Not only do our Vicksburg customers know she is looking out for them, the community knows it, too. Regions Bank’s mission is to make life better for the people and places we serve. Ginger Donohue puts our mission into action every single day.""Donohue, a 21-year veteran of Regions Bank, has lived and worked in Vicksburg all her life. To many, she’s known as ""Ms. Vicksburg."" While she supports several organizations, she has a particular soft spot for children – especially those in need.Story continuesDonohue organizes an annual school supply drive, gathers toys and gifts for holiday campaigns, raises money for scholarship funds, teaches Bible school and serves as an instructor for Regions Next Step financial wellness classes at Vicksburg High School, among other activities.In one recent year, she logged nearly 200 volunteerism hours. That’s the equivalent of five standard full-time work weeks.Indeed, as this powerful new video from Regions illustrates, Donohue’s life of service has been a natural progression, starting when she was a girl collecting donations door-to-door with her mother for Easterseals and March of Dimes.""My momma was passionate about giving back and was very involved in many nonprofit organizations,"" Donohue said. ""And my daddy had an incredible work ethic. He always said, ‘If you have a dollar, give a quarter away. If you don’t have any money, then you give your talents and your time.’""In addition to serving children, Donohue’s talents and time are also poured into leadership roles with the Vicksburg Kiwanis Club and the boards of the Vicksburg-Warren Chamber of Commerce and United Way of West Central Mississippi.""Ginger is one of the most humble, giving, loving, supportive people I have ever met in my entire life,"" said Michele Connelly, executive director of United Way of West Central Mississippi. ""She’s the epitome of someone who understands the importance of giving back – why it’s necessary to give back. She’s not doing it to put on a resume or move faster up the corporate ladder. She’s not doing it to make friends. She’s doing it because she knows there are people in the community who need what she can provide.""Donohue credits Regions for giving her the support and encouragement to serve.""Without Regions, I couldn’t do what I do for Vicksburg,"" she said. ""Not only do they ‘let’ me do what I want to do for the community, they ‘want’ me to do what I love to do. And my Beechwood branch team is like family, and they get out there and volunteer with me.""Vicksburg may be a smaller city. But Donohue’s dedication knows no limits.""We have one branch in this market, but Ginger makes sure the Vicksburg community knows that Regions is here,"" said Regions Community Development Manager LoRose Moore. ""That’s very important for our business, as well as our community engagement.""In recognition of Donohue’s service, Regions is making a $2,500 donation to United Way of West Central Mississippi. In addition, Donohue was honored at Regions’ 2023 Chairman’s Club celebration in Boston, where the company recognized its top performers this week. She will receive a commemorative plaque and five bonus vacation days – to take time for herself after dedicating so much time to others.""I do what I do because it’s what Momma, Daddy and God want me to do – and I want to make them proud,"" Donohue concluded. ""And I want to pass that along to my children and my grandchildren.""About Regions Financial CorporationRegions Financial Corporation (NYSE:RF), with $154 billion in assets, is a member of the S&amp;P 500 Index and is one of the nation’s largest full-service providers of consumer and commercial banking, wealth management, and mortgage products and services.

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Visa (NYSE:V), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. View our latest analysis for Visa How Fast Is Visa Growing?Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Visa managed to grow EPS by 11% per year, over three years. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Visa maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 15% to US$31b. That's progress.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of Visa's forecast profits?Are Visa Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Visa, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$247m. This comes in at 0.05% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Story continuesShould You Add Visa To Your Watchlist?One positive for Visa is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. For those who are looking for a little more than this, the high level of insider ownership enhances our enthusiasm for this growth. The combination definitely favoured by investors so consider keeping the company on a watchlist. What about risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Visa   you should know about.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

Visa (NYSE: V)’s net income margin continues to be among the best in the world with growing dividends and buybacks continuing to please its shareholders. Like American Express Company (NYSE: AXP), Visa’s report showed continued rise in spending as interest in travel remains strong, with the latest report marking its eight straight quarter of rising top and bottom lines.Fiscal Second Quarter FiguresFor the first three months of 2023, Visa’s revenues rose 11% YoY as they amounted to $8 billion, topping the $7.80 billion that Fact Set expected.While its credit card competitor American Express missed estimates and reported a 12% earnings drop that resulted in EPS of $2.40 per share last Thursday, Visa’s adjusted earnings jumped 19.4% to $2.09 per share, topping the expected $1.99. Unlike Visa’s, American Express’ bottom line didn’t benefit from its top line skyrocketing 22% that led to a record revenue of $14.28 billion, topping $13.98 billion that FactSet expected. Unlike Visa and Mastercard (NYSE: MA), American Express carries balances on its books. Visa and Mastercard make money from credit and debit card transaction fees.Rising VolumesPayments volume rose 10% while processed transactions increased 12% compared to last year’s quarter. Volume of international transactions rose 24% to $2.75 billion but when Europe is excluded, it actually skyrocketed 32%. Although US and Europe make 68% of Visa's total payment volumes, the main catalyst for revenue growth actually lies in international transactions as Visa has many new markets in which it can grow. Data processing revenues is a more mature segment that grew more modestly at 10% to $3.82 billion, but it still smashed expectations of $3.77 billion.Like net revenues, total operating expenses rose 11%. To maintain a strong net income margin above 50%, Visa knows it's crucial to control these expenses.Story continuesA Favorable Position With A Promising OutlookVisa is the largest publicly traded payments processing company in the world and like in any industry, size matters a lot in the payments processing industry as the bigger the dollar volume a company processes and cards it has on its payment network, the more likely businesses will accept their payment methods. Being the industry leader who is constantly strengthening its competitive position, it's no wonder that Visa’s outlook looks promising. Moreover, Visa and Mastercard form a duopoly when it comes to digitizing payments and with the society moving towards a cashless future, the undergoing trend is further fueling their revenues.A Proof Of ResilienceOnce again, Visa demonstrated its resilience in virtually any macroeconomic environment. It continued thriving in these challenging times, including the latest banking crisis and higher interest rates that caused the economic slowdown.Mastercard Is NextVisa’s peer, Mastercard, will be publishing its results later today. Although like Visa, Mastercard is also one of the steadiest stocks in the market, analysts expect Mastercard’s earnings to drop 1.8% to $2.71 per share despite an expected surge of 8.4% in revenue which is expected at $5.64 billion.Don't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 4, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis developer and operator of all-inclusive resorts is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.31 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +63.2%.Revenues are expected to be $249.27 million, up 13.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Playa Hotels?For Playa Hotels, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +40.22%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #1.So, this combination indicates that Playa Hotels will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Playa Hotels would post a loss of $0.01 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.13, delivering a surprise of +1,400%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. With that in mind, the ROCE of KLA (NASDAQ:KLAC) looks great, so lets see what the trend can tell us.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on KLA is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.40 = US$4.1b ÷ (US$14b - US$3.4b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Thus, KLA has an ROCE of 40%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 14% earned by companies in a similar industry. View our latest analysis for KLA roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for KLA compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsKLA is displaying some positive trends. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 40%. Basically the business is earning more per dollar of capital invested and in addition to that, 133% more capital is being employed now too. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.In Conclusion...All in all, it's terrific to see that KLA is reaping the rewards from prior investments and is growing its capital base. Since the stock has returned a staggering 309% to shareholders over the last five years, it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if KLA can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.Story continuesIf you'd like to know about the risks facing KLA, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should be aware of.KLA is not the only stock earning high returns.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Very Cheap Stocks to Buy Right Now.Stock valuations are again a topic of discussion currently as some analysts are warning against the market’s optimism that is sending tech valuations soaring to record levels. While several analysts believe the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates just one more time in 2023 before hitting a temporary pause, there’s a section in the market that is hoping for rate cuts. This optimism is having a direct effect on the technology sector which looks great in the short term. The S&amp;P 500 Information Technology Index is up 23% in 2023, compared to a 7.7% gain of the broader S&amp;P 500 index in the same period. According to an analysis by Bloomberg, this was the IT sector’s strongest start to a year since 2009. However, this optimism is unfounded and could cause pain for investors in the coming weeks or months. The Bloomberg report said that tech stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are trading at about 25 times their prospective earnings.“To justify such a multiple, the Fed would need to cut rates by at least 300 basis points,” the report said, citing data from Bloomberg Intelligence.The report cited Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial, who said the following:“Traders are betting on a big about-face in the Fed’s interest-rate policy, but there is no certainty as to whether, and when, this will happen. Longer-term, the sector’s growth prospects are attractive, but not at the current valuations.”Data from Research Affiliates shows that valuations of US stocks are reaching extremely high levels.Research Affiliates looked at the CAPE ratio metric and found that the US stock benchmark trades at a multiple around 29, pricier than it has been more than 90% of the time since 1881.But not all sectors emit this euphoria. The banking sector, which was devastated by the collapse of multiple banks earlier this year, is still reeling from steep share price declines. Some analysts believe some bank stocks are offering attractive entry points since the fundamentals of several banks that are currently down remain strong.Story continuesBaird analyst David George recently said in a note that the sentiment around bank stocks has been “abysmal” over the past few weeks and “market participants seem to be pricing in permanent profitability destruction, which we think is unlikely.” The analyst said that the banking sector’s risk/reward is “very attractive following panic selling.” George believes these stocks have priced in a “catastrophe.”Best Very Cheap Stocks to Buy Right NowTechnology share chartOur MethodologyFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and picked 15 tech stocks with PE ratios less than 15 as of April 25.

Investors are concerned about legal liabilities associated with its antacid drug Zantac. While it is impossible to know the outcome with certainty, our preliminary assessment suggests that the decline in market capitalization exceeds the likely financial impact on the company.”14. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) is gaining after the company posted upbeat guidance for the fiscal first quarter.  Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) expects solid performance for its integrated gas and oil products division in the quarter as compared to the last quarter of 2022.As of the end of the last quarter of 2022, 40 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL).

We did so by trimming our position in Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), a stock we added to the portfolio in Q1 2022. As an integrated energy company, approximately one third of Shell’s revenues come from transition fuels, such as LNG, and another third comes from new energy sources such as green hydrogen. LNG is one of the cleanest fossil fuels and represents a potential bridge to the future by replacing higher carbon energy sources with lower carbon ones while renewable technologies mature. As the largest LNG supplier in the world, we believe Shell is particularly well-positioned to help Europe meet its energy needs as it looks for ways to replace imported Russian oil and gas with new sources after the embargo.”13.

We reinvested the proceeds in Philip Morris so that relative position sizing is more consistent with our increased conviction.”11.

To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ).Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. See our latest analysis for Verizon Communications How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Verizon Communications is:23% = US$22b ÷ US$94b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.23.Does Verizon Communications Have A Good ROE?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Verizon Communications has a higher ROE than the average (7.9%) in the Telecom industry.roeThat's what we like to see. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk .Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROEMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesVerizon Communications' Debt And Its 23% ROEVerizon Communications clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.62. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.SummaryReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward.

These technology upgrades are part of a multi-year redesign of its network architecture to stay ahead of exponential data usage increases and to pave the way for personalized customer experiences. Network upgrades in Lansing include deploying new cell sites to extend coverage and capacity in local communities. They also include adding more capacity on fiber optic cables to move more data through the network and adding bandwidth to the cellular network to accommodate new services like wireless internet service for homes and businesses. Specifics on the upgrades include:39% of people in the Lansing area are covered with 5G Ultra Wideband service, experiencing the speed and security of 5G Ultra Wideband service. In the past several months, Verizon engineers expanded coverage and capacity with new cell sites covering the East Lansing/Okemos area. Additionally, small cells using Verizon’s premium mmWave spectrum have been deployed throughout the East Lansing and Holt communities. Engineers also addressed growing demand at MSU Spartan Stadium by adding additional 5G Ultra Wideband service there. In the near future, engineers will be working on deploying additional network solutions in Willow Creek, the Mason area, the Dewitt area and throughout West Lansing.Lansing’s exceptional 5G coverage uses a combination of mmWave spectrum and Verizon’s recently acquired C-band spectrum.  Verizon engineers are using 100 MHz of C-band spectrum to deliver 5G service to customers. By the end of the year, customers in Lansing will be able to take advantage of even more spectrum as it becomes available for 5G Ultra Wideband.  That additional bandwidth will turbo charge the service, offering significantly higher speeds, much greater capacity to accommodate more customers and more robust services.Lastly, the addition of 5G service and the many additional wireless solutions allow far more data to travel on the wireless network in Lansing.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 4, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis tool company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.73 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -134.8%.Revenues are expected to be $4 billion, down 10% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 8.82% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Stanley Black &amp; Decker?For Stanley Black &amp; Decker, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +6.85%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Stanley Black &amp; Decker will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Stanley Black &amp; Decker would post a loss of $0.33 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.10, delivering a surprise of +69.70%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Stanley Black &amp; Decker doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This compares to earnings of $2.10 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 4.41%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this manufacturer of specialized welding products and other equipment would post earnings of $1.90 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.94, delivering a surprise of 2.11%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Lincoln Electric , which belongs to the Zacks Manufacturing - Tools &amp; Related Products industry, posted revenues of $1.04 billion for the quarter ended March 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.13%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $925.45 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Lincoln Electric shares have added about 8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 5.6%.What's Next for Lincoln Electric?While Lincoln Electric has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Lincoln Electric: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $2.21 on $1.08 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $8.65 on $4.2 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Manufacturing - Tools &amp; Related Products is currently in the bottom 26% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Stanley Black &amp; Decker (SWK), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2023.

Still, overall revenue for the quarter collapsed a staggering 36% for the chip maker.Intel is struggling with a steep decline in both PC and datacenter sales, as consumers and businesses pull back on spending. PC revenue was off a whopping 38% in the quarter, while datacenter revenue fell 39%.Here are the most important numbers from the quarter compared to Wall Street analysts are expecting from the company in the quarter compared to data from Bloomberg.Revenue: $11.7 billion versus $11.1 billion expectedAdj. loss per share: $0.04 versus $0.15 expectedClient Computing: $5.8 billion versus $4.9 billion expectedDatacenter and AI: $3.7 billion versus $3.5 billion expectedShares of Intel were down more than 1% following the announcement.We delivered solid first-quarter results, representing steady progress with our transformation,” Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said in a statement.“We hit key execution milestones in our data center roadmap and demonstrated the health of the process technology underpinning it. While we remain cautious on the macroeconomic outlook, we are focused on what we can control as we deliver on IDM 2.0: driving consistent execution across process and product roadmaps and advancing our foundry business to best position us to capitalize on the $1 trillion market opportunity ahead.”Intel is in the midst of a massive turnaround campaign by CEO Pat Gelsinger, who is working to regain lost market share from rival AMD (AMD) amongst other manufacturers. But the effort is being hamstrung by the company’s poor quarterly performance and relative lack of exposure to the AI boom compared to the likes of Nvidia (NVDA).Sign up for Yahoo Finance's tech newsletter.Shares of Intel are down as much as 36% over the last 12 months, while AMD shares are roughly flat. Nvidia, which is a major provider of AI chips, is up as much as 43%. And while general market sentiment toward tech names has improved since the start of 2023, with the Nasdaq up 14%, Intel continues to trudge along.Story continuesThe company’s share price is up just 9% since January, while AMD has jumped 31% and Nvidia has rocketed up 84%.Gelsinger, however, is attempting to steer the chip giant toward a new era of growth by building out new fabrication facilities in the U.S., including a massive $20 billion chip plant in Ohio.

Consumers and businesses stocked up on new PCs during the pandemic, and as interest rates have jumped, both categories of customers are pulling back on spending on new systems.According to Gartner, worldwide PC shipments collapsed 30% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2023 to 55.2 million units.

A key driver of the loss is its memory division. Though it has traditionally been a profit driver, division saw weakness as memory chip prices fell amid dwindling demand. Well, this comes amid intensifying competition in the chip space as Intel partners with arm to operate to optimize production. Intel is set to report results after the bell.The street currently expecting a 15% share loss. Let's get to Yahoo Finances Tech Editor Dan Howley for more on this battle for market share. Dan, what are you watching?DAN HOWLEY: Yeah, so let's start with Samsung and what's going on there. And essentially, why they're seeing these issues with memory is because prices are dropping. Demand is dropping. And that's because manufacturers of devices that use memory chips basically stockpiled them during the pandemic or post-pandemic is they seen demand increase.And that stockpile now is not being used because people are cutting back on buying. And that includes consumers, as well as commercial buyers. So that's where the memory issues are coming from. Samsung then has little reason or little ability to sell them at price. So they're having to either cut price or, as they said in their announcement, scale back on production until they start to see inventory levels start to even out.Now, on Intel's side of things, they're going to report after the bell today. And we are expecting another decline there from the company. Revenue expectations are for $11.1 billion. That would be down from $18.4 billion-- excuse me-- in Q1 of 2022. We're expecting an adjusted loss per share of $0.15. That's down from an adjusted increase of $0.87 a share.The big deals here are the client computing and data center and AI divisions. Client computing, that's basically where the chips were made that go into things like PCs. That is expected to come in at $49 billion compared to 9.-- sorry-- 4.9 billion-- excuse me-- versus 9.3 billion in Q1 2022. And then on the data center side of things, it's expected to be $3.5 billion versus $6 billion in 2022.Story continuesSo I think the broader question here is we're all talking about AI NVIDIA. I mean, share prices for them are absolutely through the roof. They've rocketed since January 84%. And so why aren't we seeing the same thing out of Intel? Well, because Intel's exposure to AI isn't nearly as large as NVIDIA. NVIDIA basically hit a gold mine here.They have graphics chips. Graphics chips are great at processing multiple streams of data. And so they're perfect for AI capabilities. That's whether putting together the types of algorithms that are used in AI or putting them into use. So they are great for that. That's why we're seeing companies go and buy up tons of Intel, as well as AMD.Don't forget, they have their graphics line of products. And they're able to do the exact same thing. Intel, they make CPUs mostly. And so CPUs, they're just not built right for AI computation. And so, as a result, we're seeing fewer companies look towards Intel for AI. In fact, if you look at what we had seen from reports about Meta from a Reuters report, they had said that Meta was struggling with their AI side because they were using CPUs rather than GPUs.Now, whether or not they were using Intel or NVIDIA's, besides the point, that's just to illustrate that CPUs are not built for this kind of function. So now that we're seeing more people pile into that, I don't think that we're going to get the kind of boost out of Intel that we may from NVIDIA or AMD because of that wave of AI.- We'll certainly be checking in on that when we get the notes after the call to sort of dive into that. I'm sure people will have questions about that AI exposure. A big thank you there to Yahoo Finance's Tech Editor Dan Howley, Thanks so much.]"

Ryan had ample power, as head of Fox's nominating and corporate governance committee, to call for action from his fellow Fox board members, the complaint alleged. Instead, shareholders said, he made a bad-faith decision to do nothing.“Ryan manifestly knew that the accusations were false,” the newly unsealed complaint alleges. “Yet he took no board action, either to stop the libel or to retract it or to put appropriate policies in place.”Story continuesIn the horns of a dilemma, the new complaint said, “Ryan chose sloth.”Ryan, who has served on the Fox board since March 2019, did not respond to an email I sent to him via Fox Corp or to a phone message I left at the private equity firm Solamere Capital, where he is a partner.The latest lawsuit, which also asserts claims against the rest of Fox’s directors and officers, ascribes a particular motive to Ryan: He knew that audience metrics were a factor in the compensation that would be awarded to Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch. So, according to the shareholder suit, he did nothing to stop Fox from appeasing its audience with election fraud reporting in order to keep the Murdochs happy. Otherwise, the suit alleges, Ryan might have made enemies of these kingmakers, dashing any remaining ambitions Ryan might have to run again for elected office.A Fox Corp spokesman did not respond to my email. In its settlement with Dominion, Fox acknowledged a judicial ruling that it reported dozens of false election fraud allegations about the company.Shareholder lawyer Kurt Heyman, whose first-filed complaint omits Ryan as a defendant, declined to comment. Plaintiffs' lawyer Samuel Closic of Prickett, Jones &amp; Elliott, who signed a follow-up complaint lambasting Ryan, also declined to comment.The shareholder derivative litigation against Fox officers and directors is still in early stages. At least one other complaint is expected to be filed, based on an April 19 heads-up letter that a group of prominent plaintiffs' firms sent to Vice Chancellor Travis Laster, who is overseeing the case. My reporting suggests additional shareholder firms are also likely to emerge with their own version of derivative claims against Fox’s directors and officers.Eventually, Laster will pick one set of lawyers to lead the litigation attempting to recoup money from Fox directors and officers for the cost of their alleged oversight failures. Even then, it’s likely that the case won’t be resolved until after the conclusion of a $2.7 billion defamation suit by voting tech company Smartmatic USA Corp.I’m focusing now on the divergent views of Ryan’s potential liability because one of the factors Laster will consider when he selects a slate of lawyers to run the case will be their liability theories, so it's notable that the two cases on file disagree so significantly about Ryan's role.They do not disagree, however, on what Ryan knew and said about the election fraud conspiracies promulgated by former President Trump and his supporters. Ryan believed the conspiracy theories were bunk. He said so publicly, according to a Politico article cited in the new shareholder complaint, at a Bank of America conference on Nov. 24, 2020, just weeks after the election was called for Joe Biden.Privately, according to discovery from the Dominion lawsuit that is cited in both shareholder complaints, Ryan began warning the Murdochs even before then to stop airing election fraud allegations from the president and his allies.Fox’s board members and senior executives gathered on Nov. 10, 2020, for a three-day session culminating in the annual shareholder meeting. Evidence from the Dominion case shows that even at that early date, Ryan had already expressed concern to the Murdochs about Fox coverage. Ryan testified in his Dominion deposition that board members discussed Trump efforts to undo the election at the November meeting.But Fox’s formal board minutes “contain no record of such discussion,” the newly unsealed complaint said. Ryan and the other directors, it alleged, knew Trump allies were already spreading conspiracy theories on Fox, “but faithlessly took no board action, not then and not ever.”Under Fox’s bylaws, the new complaint claims, Ryan could have teamed up with one other independent director to call for a special board meeting as the network continued to provide a platform for allegations that Ryan had renounced. He could have insisted that his corporate governance committee be appointed to monitor “unreliable” Fox hosts and guests, the complaint said. At the very least, shareholders said, Ryan’s committee could have assigned monitoring responsibility to a different board committee.Ryan’s failure to take any such actions, despite his own, public repudiation of election fraud conspiracy theories, puts him at “a heightened likelihood of liability,” according to the new complaint.Or not, according to the April 11 complaint.Someday we may know if Paul Ryan was an unsung hero or a faithless board member as Fox covered the aftermath of the 2020 election. Clearly, that day is not now.Read more:Fox shareholders are circling Rupert MurdochExclusive -- Fox investors seek records in possible step toward suing directors (Reporting By Alison Frankel; editing by Leigh Jones)]"

In 2016, he offered mobile data for free, making his Jio telecom service India's top player. He is adopting a similar strategy to promote his consumer goods to rival Coca-Cola and Nestle.Viacom18, the broadcast division of Ambani's Reliance Industries, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Its shareholders also include Paramount Global as well as Bodhi Tree, a joint venture between James Murdoch and former top Disney executive, Uday Shankar.The Warner deal, industry executives and media analysts said, will boost Viacom18's already announced plans to ""innovate and disrupt"" the sector, and help to attract the premium English speaking audience in India.At stake is a slice of a video streaming market that is expected to grow annually by 22%-25% to reach $13-$15 billion by 2030, according to a 2021 report by Indian lobby group CII and the Boston Consulting Group.That compares with projected annual growth of 8.63% in the U.S. market, which is expected to hit $54.66 billion by 2027, according to Statista.While Netflix and other rivals boast of content specially created for the India audience, JioCinema's current free offerings largely include old Hindi and local language movies. In sports, it has IPL cricket streaming rights until 2027 and in March bagged exclusive rights for MotoGP in India.Story continuesThe big challenge is lack of fresh local and global content on JioCinema, something that will be become even more critical as the IPL season ends next month.JioCinema is in talks with various production studios and has plans to introduce dozens of TV shows and movies on the platform in the coming months, in Hindi and other languages, a second industry source told Reuters on Friday.""There are many Indias within India. While IPL is for the masses, partnership with Warner is a precursor to JioCinema's entry into the premium subscription segment,"" said Mihir Shah, vice president at Media Partners Asia.Nitesh Kripalani, former country head of Amazon's Prime Video in India, said he expects Reliance's venture to do more such deals, but pricing remains key.""India is a value conscious market. For any media business, anywhere in the world - you need to get consumers to pay. Advertising can only pay so much,"" he said.Netflix, Amazon and Disney Hotstar have become popular in India by launching exclusive movies and web series starring Bollywood actors. They have also diversified into regional local language content.At present Netflix - which has most the expensive subscription plans - has just 8 million subscribers, Amazon has 17 million, while Disney, which earlier had the digital rights for IPL, leads with 49 million, according to Media Partners, which doesn't have data for JioCinema's free service.Karan Taurani, a vice president of India's Elara Capital, sad JioCinema's success will hinge on quality of its content.""They may make so many films and series but (what if) more than 70-80% of them bomb? The only way to scale up is to really differentiate your content and make sure execution is right,"" he said.(This story has been corrected to add the dropped words 'in India,' in paragraph 1)(Editing by Sharon Singleton)]"

Ron DeSantis speaks at the Heritage Foundation 50th Anniversary Celebration leadership summit, Friday, April 21, 2023, in Oxon Hill, Md. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)DeSantis has called Disney's lawsuit a politically motivated attack and accused the company of lacking accountability.The governor's spokesman said on Wednesday that his office was unaware of any legal right that allows a company to operate its own government or maintain special privileges, a reference to the decades-old district that is home to Disney World.Legal experts said DeSantis may have sound policy reasons to reconstitute the authority formerly known as Reedy Creek Improvement District, but if Disney can show it was done as retaliation, the company has a strong case.The fallout between Florida's biggest employer and its governor with presidential aspirations began last year.Story continuesPressured by its employees, Disney spoke out against the Parental Rights in Education Act that banned discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity for young students, dubbed by critics as the ""don't say gay"" bill.DeSantis hit back, marshalling the Republican legislature to eventually seize control from the company of the special district that helped develop Disney World.Disney claimed in its lawsuit that the state adopted a ""targeted campaign of government retaliation — orchestrated at every step by Governor DeSantis as punishment for Disney’s protected speech.""The U.S. Supreme Court in a 2010 case known as Citizens United ruled that government could not limit political speech of corporations and other entities under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.HISTORY AND CONTEXT For Disney to prevail, a jury would have to find a connection between the company's comments and the changes to the development district, renamed under DeSantis' control as the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District.DeSantis may argue that government has given the company special tax benefits over the years and Florida is entitled to change that.But Leslie Kendrick, the director of the Center for the First Amendment at University of Virginia School of Law, said it will come down to the reason for the changes.""First Amendment law would say that is problematic if it's done because of the speaker's protected speech,"" Kendrick said.DeSantis' tough talk toward Disney is cited throughout the lawsuit, including 18 quotes referring to some form of ""woke Disney.""The lawsuit cites an opinion piece DeSantis wrote for the Wall Street Journal in which he said when companies like Disney use their power to ""advance a woke agenda,"" leaders must fight back or they surrender ""the political battlefield to the militant left.""Legal experts said examples of retaliation for political speech often involve state employees.One business example Kendrick cited involved a newspaper tax imposed on publications with a circulation of 20,000 in Louisiana in 1934, influenced by the state's powerful senator, Huey Long. The law was largely seen as punishing a student paper critical of the former governor, even though it impacted 13 publications, many of which sued.The lawsuit over the tax eventually made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which struck it down in a case known as Grosjean v American Press Co.The justices said the tax was seen as a deliberate attempt to limit the spread of information and it was ""suspicious"" the way law was developed.""History and context really matters,"" Kendrick said. ""If there is evidence that you did it for reasons that implicate the First Amendment, to punish the speaker, then we have a problem.""(Reporting by Tom Hals in Wilmington, Delaware Editing by Noeleen Walder and Matthew Lewis)]"

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 4, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis utility holding company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.29 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -3.3%.Revenues are expected to be $6.17 billion, up 6.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.09% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for PG&amp;E?For PG&amp;E, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +6.90%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that PG&amp;E will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that PG&amp;E would post earnings of $0.28 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.26, delivering a surprise of -7.14%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.PG&amp;E doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, Exelon (EXC), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.66 per share for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +3.1%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $5.52 billion, up 3.6% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Exelon has been revised 2.9% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, an equal Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Exelon will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We began 2023 with positive momentum, with sequential improvement in net and organic sales growth, gross profit margin, advertising spending, operating profit and free cash flow. Net sales increased 8.5%, and organic sales grew 10.0% with growth in every division and in all four of our categories.Story continues""Despite continued pressure from raw and packaging material costs during the quarter, gross profit margin improved sequentially versus fourth quarter 2022, which helped fund a 14% increase in advertising in support of our pricing and robust innovation across all categories. We expect to drive further gross margin improvement in the balance of the year through continued strong pricing and the benefits from funding-the-growth and other productivity initiatives.""Looking ahead, while we still see uncertainty in the global operating environment, particularly in the back half of the year, we feel well positioned to deliver on our increased 2023 sales and earnings growth expectations and drive value for our stakeholders.""Full Year 2023 GuidanceBased on current spot rates:The Company now expects net sales growth to be 3% to 6% including the benefit from our acquisitions of pet food businesses and a low-single-digit negative impact from foreign exchange.The Company now expects organic sales growth to be 4% to 6%.On a GAAP basis, the Company still expects gross profit margin expansion, increased advertising investment and double-digit earnings-per-share growth.On a non-GAAP (Base Business) basis, the Company still expects gross profit margin expansion and increased advertising investment and now expects mid-single-digit earnings-per-share growth.Divisional PerformanceThe following are comments about divisional performance for first quarter 2023 versus the year ago period.

CL-EMarket Share InformationManagement uses market share information as a key indicator to monitor business health and performance. References to market share in this press release are based on a combination of consumption and market share data provided by third-party vendors, primarily Nielsen, and internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of the dollar value of sales of our products, relative to all product sales in the category in the countries in which the Company competes and purchases data (excluding Venezuela from all periods).Market share data is subject to limitations on the availability of up-to-date information. In particular, market share data is currently not generally available for certain retail channels, such as eCommerce and certain club retailers and discounters. The Company measures year-to-date market shares from January 1 of the relevant year through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months. The Company believes that the third-party vendors it uses to provide data are reliable, but it has not verified the accuracy or completeness of the data or any assumptions underlying the data. In addition, market share information reported by the Company may be different from market share information reported by other companies due to differences in category definitions, the use of data from different countries, internal estimates and other factors.Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release and the related webcast may contain forward-looking statements (as that term is defined in the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 or by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its rules, regulations and releases) that set forth anticipated results based on management’s current plans and assumptions. Such statements may relate, for example, to sales or volume growth, net selling price increases, organic sales growth, profit or profit margin levels, earnings per share levels, financial goals, the impact of foreign exchange, the impact of COVID-19, the impact of the war in Ukraine, cost-reduction plans (including the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative), tax rates, interest rates, new product introductions, digital capabilities, commercial investment levels, acquisitions, divestitures, share repurchases or legal or tax proceedings, among other matters. These statements are made on the basis of the Company’s views and assumptions as of this time and the Company undertakes no obligation to update these statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law or by the rules and regulations of the SEC. Moreover, the Company does not, nor does any other person, assume responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of these statements. The Company cautions investors that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that actual events or results may differ materially from those statements. For more information about factors that could impact the Company’s business and cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, investors should refer to the Company’s filings with the SEC (including, but not limited to, the information set forth under the captions ""Risk Factors"" and ""Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements"" in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 and subsequent filings with the SEC). Copies of these filings may be obtained upon request from the Company’s Investor Relations Department or on the Company’s website at www.colgatepalmolive.com.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThe following provides definitions and other information regarding the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release and the related prepared materials and webcast, which may not be the same as or comparable to similar measures presented by other companies:Base Business: Base Business refers to non-GAAP measures of operating results that exclude certain items. Base Business operating results exclude, as applicable, charges related to an ERISA litigation matter, product recall costs and charges related to the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative.Organic sales growth: Net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments.Free cash flow before dividends: Net cash provided by operations less Capital expenditures.This press release discusses Net sales growth (GAAP) and Organic sales growth (non-GAAP). Management believes the organic sales growth measure provides investors and analysts with useful supplemental information regarding the Company’s underlying sales trends by presenting sales growth excluding the external factor of foreign exchange as well as the impact from acquisitions and divestments. See ""Geographic Sales Analysis Percentage Changes"" for the three months ended March 31, 2023 versus 2022 included with this release for a comparison of Organic sales growth to Net sales growth in accordance with GAAP.Other (income) expense, net, Operating profit, Operating profit margin, Non-service related postretirement costs, Effective income tax rate, Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company and Diluted earnings per common share are disclosed on both an as reported (GAAP) and Base Business (non-GAAP) basis. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude items that, either by their nature or amount, management would not expect to occur as part of the Company’s normal business on a regular basis, such as restructuring charges, charges for certain litigation and tax matters, acquisition-related costs, gains and losses from certain divestitures and certain other unusual, non-recurring items. Investors and analysts use these financial measures in assessing the Company’s business performance, and management believes that presenting these financial measures on a non-GAAP basis provides them with useful supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the Company’s underlying business performance and trends. These non-GAAP financial measures also enhance the ability to compare period-to-period financial results. See ""Non-GAAP Reconciliations"" for three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 included with this release for a reconciliation of these financial measures to the related GAAP measures.The Company uses these financial measures internally in its budgeting process, to evaluate segment and overall operating performance and as factors in determining compensation. While the Company believes that these financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company’s underlying business performance and trends, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.As management uses free cash flow before dividends to evaluate the Company’s ability to satisfy current and future obligations, pay dividends, fund future business opportunities and repurchase stock, the Company believes that it provides useful information to investors. Free cash flow before dividends is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since the Company has certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure. See ""Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows"" for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 for a comparison of free cash flow before dividends to Net cash provided by operations as reported in accordance with GAAP.(See attached tables for first quarter results.)Table 1Colgate-Palmolive CompanyCondensed Consolidated Statements of IncomeFor the Three Months Ended March 31, 2023

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Colgate is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for CL in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 71 cents per share for CL, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 70 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for CL, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.43% heading into earnings season.Colgate-Palmolive Company Price and EPS SurpriseColgate-Palmolive Company Price and EPS SurpriseColgate-Palmolive Company price-eps-surprise | Colgate-Palmolive Company QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

Before we get in the quarter, let me just acknowledge the news that you all saw earlier this week. Obviously, a tough moment. But we are so fortunate to have a fabulous and tenured leadership team at NBCUniversal. You go down the list, you'll see many of them have been leading their divisions within the company for at least 10 years and are truly the best in the business. We're also lucky to have Mike Cavanagh step in at the helm at NBCUniversal while also remaining President. Mike is a fantastic executive and operator that many of you know well. He'll work closely with each of the management team at NBCUniversal to continue our excellent momentum. Mike, alongside with Jason Armstrong, will lead these earnings calls on a go-forward basis. Today, you'll hear from them about our strategic focus and drivers of growth now and over the long term. Jason will go into much greater details on the first quarter results. Dave Watson and I are here for Q&amp;A. You'll hear a lot more about the great momentum of our Connectivity &amp; Platforms businesses later in the call. Dave, thanks for getting off to a great start this year. But before I hand it over to Mike, I just want to share my quick perspective on our recent performance. This really was a strong quarter and start to the year, especially within the context of what continues to be a choppy macro environment. We grew adjusted EBITDA by 3% and adjusted EPS by 7%. In addition, we generated $3.8 billion of free cash flow and returned $3.2 billion of capital to shareholders all while continuing to invest importantly in a number of major initiatives, which is a real testament to our very healthy balance sheet. Two things amongst many highlights in particular that stand out for me, and I'm really proud of. One is the animation business. By strengthening and combining our capabilities across DreamWorks and Illumination led by Chris Meledandri, we've had tremendous success creating franchises that people know and love all over the world: Despicable Me, Shrek, Pets, Minions and more recently, Puss in Boots and now Super Mario Bros., which just broke a number of records, including the biggest worldwide opening of any animated film all time. These are the results of the strategic decision we made years ago to become a leader in animation and the conviction we've had to continue to invest in the business even during the depths of the pandemic, which are now clearly paying off. The second is Connectivity &amp; Platforms. The significant margin expansion that we achieved this quarter, coupled with the 4.5% ARPU growth in domestic residential broadband, demonstrates successful discipline and excellent management in a challenging competitive environment. We're focused on delivering a superior experience and profitably serving our customers, and it shows. And with that, let me now hand the call over to Mike.Michael J. CavanaghThanks, Brian. We had a great start to 2023 and have set ourselves up for another strong year. We have amazing talent at all levels of our company and DNA that fosters creativity and collaboration, resulting in operational excellence that is second to none. Couple that with our position as a scaled leader in very large and profitable markets with tens of millions of customers paying us over $100 per month as well as hundreds of millions of TV and streaming viewers, and we have an extremely healthy balance sheet, enabling us to invest in all of our strategic opportunities and for great returns while also returning a healthy amount of capital to shareholders. As pleased as we are with our results in the first quarter, any company's performance in a quarter is just a milestone of progress against the longer-term strategy and plan. And so before we dive deeper into the details of the last few months, I'd like to spend a few minutes talking about the drivers of our growth over the longer term and where we're focusing most of our time and resources. I put these in 4 buckets: residential connectivity, business services connectivity, our theme parks and experiences and our premium content creation. I'll start with residential connectivity, which is comprised of domestic broadband, domestic wireless and international connectivity. Broadband is a fantastic business. It's a great product for the consumer, and demand continues to rise. People are connecting more and more devices to our network, and they're consuming a tremendous amount of data. Right now, the average monthly data usage for a broadband customer that doesn't take video from us is nearly 700 gigabytes. And there is a related increase in the importance of reliability and speed with roughly 1/3 of our customers at 1 gigabit or higher and nearly 3/4 at or above 400 megabits. For us, the consumers' already high and increasing level of expectation for their broadband experience is an important trend. And while the marketplace is competitive such that adding subs in the near term is likely to be a challenge, I fully expect we will eventually return to subscriber growth. We have the best hand out there to win against all the competing technologies, whether it's fiber or fixed wireless. We view fiber as our long-term competitor. We have been successfully competing against fiber for about 20 years, yet still built a base of 32 million broadband customers over this time period. Our strategy is to have the most robust network, which we're making even better as we transition to DOCSIS 4.0 and surrounding our industry-leading broadband experience with multiple services that provide additional value. And now we have the ability to offer the consumer a converged connectivity package that includes a great wireless product based on a capital-light model with favorable economics combined with excellent Wi-Fi. A more recent competitor is fixed wireless, which we view as a substandard and temporary solution for a certain segment based on their needs at this moment in time. Our approach is to compete rationally. We know how to segment the market. We have packages that cater to customers who want the very fastest speeds and premium features and others that are more targeted to those looking for value-oriented solutions. We trialed a couple of offers targeted to this lower end during the quarter. We were pleased with the results, and we'll continue to remain nimble and respond competitively in each segment. In the meantime, as the residential connectivity market and macroeconomic environment continue to evolve, our focus will be on serving our existing base, growing broadband ARPU, increasing our penetration in wireless and making proactive investments to expand our footprint at the fastest pace in our history. You saw us do this all of last year and in the first quarter, and I expect this trend to continue. Our second major growth opportunity, business services, which is approaching $10 billion in annual revenue, is growing at mid-single digits with newly reported margins just shy of 60% and delivering adjusted EBITDA growth in the high single-digit range. Here too, our advanced and adaptable network infrastructure is much better suited to serving commercial and government locations compared to the legacy wireline and wireless providers. We move fast and are more capable of reliably and cost effectively meeting our customers' needs. We already have over 2.5 million domestic business customers, more than any other competitor and are targeting a $50 billion market opportunity within our footprint and a $70 billion to $100 billion total market opportunity that we can now go after by leveraging our technology and partners outside of our footprint. Our third major growth opportunity is in creating experiences from our own intellectual property as well as special IP that we license from others and bring to life at our theme parks like Harry Potter or Nintendo's characters like Mario. Our parks are resonating with our customers, and this segment is clearly on a roll. Japan has come roaring back, and Beijing returned to profitability following last year when both were operating under COVID-related restrictions. And on the domestic side, Orlando continues to do well, and Hollywood just opened Super Nintendo World with great success. This outstanding performance provides us with even more confidence that the investments we are making in new lands and attractions will also generate strong returns. And I'm excited for what's to come: Donkey Kong, another Nintendo land to open in Japan in 2024, Epic Universe in Orlando in 2025 as well as the smaller park concepts that we recently announced: a horror-themed experience in Las Vegas and a new park in Texas that's specifically designed for younger guests and their families. Our fourth growth area is content and especially on the streaming side. We have a decades-deep library of iconic films in television. And we spend over $20 billion each year to produce and provide programming that spans every genre, sports, news, entertainment, dramas and film, which has resulted in the broadest reach of any media company. Over 100 million people engage with our content every month. In film, we were #2 in the worldwide box office last year with Jurassic, Minions and Halloween. And based on the current course, we are trending to do even better in 2023. We've started the year off with home runs and terrific momentum, carryover from Puss in Boots, the success from M3GAN and now Super Mario Bros., which in just 3 weekends has already crossed $875 million at the global box office. We're really proud of our animation business. We've been in the movie business for 100 years, and it's exciting how we've been able to create and monetize our entire movie slate in animation and beyond and in so many ways, including the innovative changes we've made in movie windowing. We made the strategic decision to put our Pay-One window on Peacock, which really kicked in at the end of last year. We now have one of the most robust movie offerings on streaming. The hits we have at the box office roll on to Peacock, and this is proving to be both a successful acquisition and retention tool. Add to that, the strength of content from our TV studio, which powers the content on NBC and helped make us #1 for many years from all the Dick Wolf procedurals and SNL coupled with highly popular content on Bravo, this all goes to Peacock the next day. Add to this our originals, where we were just getting started, shows like Poker Face, which launched and immediately landed near the top of Nielsen's U.S. streaming original list. And we have lots more coming. On top of all of this, we have an incredible lineup of sports, Sunday Night Football, Premier League and soon, Big 10. We believe we have the right strategy for Peacock and one that's suited to our strengths: premium content with a dual revenue stream, both advertising and subscription fees. And we're encouraged by our results so far, growing paid subscribers and engagement levels to roughly 20 hours per subscriber per month, fueling strong growth in advertising revenues. We're investing, but the results we are seeing give us confidence that we are on the right path for Peacock to breakeven and grow from there. Looking across our entire organization, I couldn't think of a more advantageous position to be in to monetize the increasing expectations demand as well as the changing habits of the global consumer. We're the best broadband company with the best content that can be accessed over the best distribution and aggregation platforms. I'm excited about all of our areas of growth. Together, they represent the majority of our revenue and our businesses with high incremental margins. As a result, these growth areas should become the dominant driver of our financial results for years to come. With that, I'll hand it over to Jason to talk about the quarter.Jason S. ArmstrongThanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. In late February, we announced that starting this quarter, we will be reporting our results in 2 reportable business units: Connectivity &amp; Platforms and Content &amp; Experiences. More closely align our like-minded businesses reflect how we run our company and highlight our opportunities for growth as a globally integrated content distribution company. We're also providing more disclosure around areas that have become increasingly important to our overall results, namely business services and Peacock. Let's start with our consolidated first quarter results on Slide 4. Total company revenue of $29.7 billion declined 4% due to the tough comparison to last year's Winter Olympics and Super Bowl as well as the negative impact of foreign currency, while our total company adjusted EBITDA grew 3%, thanks to continued strong operating leverage at our high-margin Connectivity &amp; Platforms business. Excluding the impacts of the Winter Olympics and Super Bowl and adjusting for constant currency, total company revenue increased 1.5%. We grew adjusted earnings per share by 7% to $0.92 and generated $3.8 billion of free cash flow while returning $3.2 billion of capital to shareholders in the first quarter. This is in addition to significant investments to support and grow our businesses, including our transition to DOCSIS 4.0 and footprint expansion in broadband, the construction of Epic as well as consistent flow of new lands and attractions at our theme parks and content production at our studios, which feeds into Peacock, a robust third-party licensing opportunity and a really successful film business. When taken together, these investment areas generated over half of total company revenue in the first quarter with growth of 10% year-over-year. Now let's turn to our business results. Starting on Slide 5 with Connectivity &amp; Platforms. As a reminder, our largest foreign exchange exposure is the British pound, which was down over 9% year-over-year. So in order to highlight the underlying performance of the business, I'll speak to our results at Connectivity &amp; Platforms on a constant currency basis. Revenue was flat this quarter, but this is worth unpacking. Our core connectivity revenues, residential and business, grew over 7% to $10 billion, while video, advertising and other revenues declined 7% to $9.8 billion. Year-over-year, we generated 160 basis points of margin expansion for Connectivity &amp; Platforms on a total basis. This is reflective of our strategy of investing in and driving growth in high-margin businesses while protecting profitability in businesses with secular headwinds through disciplined cost control. To get into more detail, residential connectivity revenue grew by 8% with 5% growth in domestic broadband, 27% growth in wireless and 18% growth in international. In business services connectivity, revenue continued to grow at a healthy mid-single-digit pace. Our domestic residential broadband customer base this quarter remained stable over both the last year and in the quarter with churn remaining below pre-pandemic levels. While we had some success towards the end of the quarter with a couple of offers targeting the lower end of the market, the broadband environment remains highly competitive right now, particularly at the lower end. And as such, our view remains that 2023 will be a challenging period for us to add subs. Our outlook for growth and our strategy has been consistent. We will compete aggressively but do so in a financially disciplined way. While we expect to return to growth in broadband subscribers over time, during this interim period as well as over the longer term, we will focus on protecting and growing broadband ARPU. And we're pleased with the 4.5% year-over-year increase in ARPU in the quarter. We expect continued strong revenue growth over the course of 2023 and expect ARPU will be the primary driver. Growth in domestic wireless revenue was a function of higher service revenue driven by continued strong momentum in customer lines, which are up 1.4 million or 32% year-over-year to 5.7 million in total, including the 355,000 lines we just added, which was a record high for a first quarter. There is clearly demand for a converged offering that delivers reliable and fast speeds, both in and out of the home. We are extremely well positioned to take advantage of this trend and have a long runway for growth as less than 10% of our broadband accounts currently take our mobile offering. A new disclosure category for us is international connectivity. Roughly 2/3 of international connectivity revenue is broadband, growing at mid-teens levels. The remaining 1/3 is wireless, of which a big portion comes from device sales and therefore, tends to fluctuate with the timing of device launches. The rest of wireless is service revenue, which is growing nicely due to additional customer lines and healthy ARPU growth. The strong revenue growth in our connectivity businesses was offset by declines in video due to customer losses relative to last year, in other revenue reflecting similar dynamics in wireline voice and in advertising, which was impacted by a tough macro environment in addition to lower political revenue in our domestic markets. On the expense side, every expense line item declined in the first quarter with the exception of direct product costs, which are success-based and directly associated with the significant growth in our connectivity businesses. The strong execution by the team to deliver sustainable operating efficiencies, coupled with solid growth in our high-margin connectivity businesses, resulted in Connectivity &amp; Platforms EBITDA growth of 4% to $8.1 billion. And as I mentioned a moment ago, an adjusted margin expanding 160 basis points year-over-year. And that is despite some temporary margin headwinds in our international business associated with some pressure on revenue due to a challenging macro environment and higher programming costs for sports channels, which were up this year given the timing of events. Margin for our domestic legacy Cable business improved 250 basis points, reaching a record high of 46.5%. We've added disclosure this quarter and going forward to break down profitability between residential and business services. Residential Connectivity &amp; Platforms EBITDA grew 3% with margin improving 140 basis points to reach 37.8%, highlighting favorable revenue mix shifts. Business services connectivity EBITDA grew 8%, with margin expanding 150 basis points to reach 58.3%. Over the years, we've talked about business services as a driver of margin accretive growth, and we're excited to augment our disclosure in this area for the first time. Our results in the quarter and our new reporting structure clearly show that. This is a business that generated over $5 billion of EBITDA in 2022 with substantial growth ahead and should be a material contributor to our growth profile in Connectivity &amp; Platforms and overall. Wrapping up on Connectivity &amp; Platforms, I'm proud of the team successfully navigating a transition in which we're managing businesses that have secular headwinds with an appropriately high level of cost discipline while investing in others that clearly have strong revenue growth and margin characteristics. Now let's turn to Content &amp; Experiences on Slide 6. Content &amp; Experiences revenue decreased nearly 10%, reflecting the difficult comparison to last year, which included $1.5 billion of revenue from the Winter Olympics and the Super Bowl reported in our Media segment. And EBITDA decreased 1% as a record first quarter at parks and strong studio growth driven by a successful film slate was offset by the planned increase in our Peacock investment as well as lower linear advertising sales. Unpacking these results further, Media revenue decreased 21% on an as-reported basis and 2% when excluding the Olympics and Super Bowl primarily due to a 6% decline in domestic advertising, reflecting softness in the overall ad market, which appears to have stabilized, offset somewhat by strong growth in Peacock advertising revenue. When you exclude Olympics and Super Bowl, Peacock advertising increased an impressive 90%.Domestic distribution revenue decreased 8% but was up 4% excluding the Olympics driven by Peacock with distribution revenue up 83%. In total, Peacock revenue increased by 45% to $685 million, led by strong growth in paid subscribers, which were up over 60% year-over-year, ending the quarter with nearly 22 million paid subs, which marked another terrific milestone on our path to scaling the service. We're encouraged with the trends we're seeing at Peacock. While we've proven that special content and major events like the World Cup at the end of last year can be significant acquisition drivers, perhaps equally or even more important is sustaining engagement following this type of acquisition content and delivering on retention. We saw that in the first quarter. And we look forward to reporting further momentum in the enhanced disclosures we're now providing for Peacock, including the revenue breakdown between advertising and distribution and costs separated by programming and production versus marketing, promotion and other. Another new category that we added to our Media disclosure is international networks. This is mainly distribution revenue for Sky Sports, and the low single-digit revenue increase in the quarter was driven by higher distribution revenue, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation. Other revenue decreased 21% due to lower content licensing. Media EBITDA decreased 26%, including a $704 million EBITDA loss at Peacock. We view Media as one business. And while we have made cost reductions at our linear networks, we reallocated some of these resources to Peacock with the goal of maximizing profitability over the short and long term across streaming and linear. We continue to expect Peacock losses for the year to be around $3 billion, which we believe will be peak losses for Peacock and then begin to steadily improve. At Studios, this was a great quarter for our film slate with strong theatrical revenue growth driven by the successful carryover from Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, which launched at the end of the fourth quarter, as well as new releases such as M3GAN and Cocaine Bear. While revenue growth was partially offset by lower content licensing at our television studios, the momentum in our film business drove a 13% increase in Studio EBITDA, which also included marketing and promotion expense associated with the April 5 release of Super Mario Bros., which is fueling a strong start to our second quarter. At Theme Parks, revenue grew 25% and EBITDA 46% to $658 million, thanks to a continued rebound following the lift of COVID restrictions and a testament to the significant investments we've made at our parks. While demand and financial results were strong across the board, our international parks drove most of the growth this quarter. With Japan no longer impacted by COVID restrictions, our park in Osaka continued to rebound. And we are seeing significant demand for Super Nintendo World, which we opened in early 2021. But given the COVID-related restrictions that were in place, many people couldn't visit the park. Our park in Beijing was also impacted by COVID-related restrictions last year and is now growing at a very healthy rate. Beijing showed strong year-over-year improvement and was profitable in the quarter despite normal winter seasonal headwinds. On the domestic side, Hollywood enjoyed record first quarter results due to the very successful opening of Super Nintendo World, while Orlando continues to trend above pre-pandemic levels. I'll now wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 7. As I mentioned previously, we generated $3.8 billion in free cash flow this quarter and achieved this while absorbing a high level of working capital and making meaningful investments in our network and theme parks. These investments drove a 37% increase in total capital spending primarily driven by higher CapEx. At Connectivity &amp; Platforms, CapEx increased 30% with CapEx intensity coming in at 9.7% primarily driven by investments to further strengthen and extend our network. In 2022, CapEx intensity at Connectivity &amp; Platforms was 10%. And we expect to achieve a similar level in 2023, which is inclusive of the prior guidance we provided for our domestic Cable business at year-end as we continue to transition our U.S. network to DOCSIS 4.0 as well as accelerate our growth in homes passed. Content &amp; Experiences CapEx increased by $343 million driven by parks with Epic accounting for the majority of this quarter's increase in spend. As we noted on our year-end call, we expect park's CapEx in 2023 to increase by around $1.2 billion, remain elevated in 2024 and then decrease in 2025, the year we open Epic. Wrapping up, since this is my first quarter as CFO, let me reiterate our capital allocation framework. First is to invest for growth in our businesses. We've talked through many examples today: Epic, our broadband network, streaming and aggregation to name a few. Second is to protect our balance sheet position with targeted leverage of around 2.4x. This is an optimal level, we believe, to maintain broad and deep capital markets access through a cycle, balanced prudently with the opportunity for enhanced levered equity returns. Third is to return cash to shareholders. I'm proud that we bought back $12 billion of stock in the last 12 months, including $2 billion this quarter, shrinking our share count by 7% in that time frame in addition to a healthy and growing dividend, which we just increased by over 7% in January. With that, I'll turn the call back to Marci for Q&amp;A. Marci?Marci RyvickerThanks, Jason. Operator, let's open up the call for questions, please.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.Benjamin Daniel SwinburneTwo questions, one on NBC and one on wireless. I don't know if this is probably for Mike. Mike, when you look at NBCUniversal, you got probably businesses that are doing better than ever when you look at parks and your studio. And obviously, there's a lot of disruption in the Media business. I'm just wondering, given the management chain and sort of your broader role, is this an opportunity to revisit that business strategically, operationally from a cost structure point of view, just with fresh eyes? I realize you've been obviously President and watching that business for some time. But I just wanted to hear your thoughts just given all that's going on at NBC. And then maybe for Dave, the wireless business is continuing to scale. You talked about demand for converged offers being clear and strong. What are your ambitions here as you look through the rest of '23 to continue to accelerate the growth in that business? How do you guys drive that penetration of your broadband base meaningfully higher?Michael J. CavanaghBen, it's Mike. So I'll jump in. Thanks for the question. So appreciate the comment. I have been here -- it's hard to believe it's going to be in 2 weeks, I'll have been here, 2 or 3 weeks, 8 years as partner to Brian and the rest of the leadership team. So it is correct that I've been close to all these things, not just recently as President for the last half year or so but really since I joined. So in thinking about the strategies of NBC, I would think the way you should think about it is the way we operate across the businesses, including NBC, is that the strategies were developed by the entire leadership team. Brian mentioned how great a team we have across a diverse collection of business, parks, studios, TV, streaming services, news, sports. So you can imagine that strategy put together by those teams of leaders, obviously, in conjunction with the ultimate leader and then with Brian and myself. So we've been deeply involved for a long, long time in what those strategies are all about and in tracking how we're doing. So while it's unfortunate to have an unexpected change in leadership, I would tell you, it is not -- there is no reason for anyone to think that we're going to be revisiting strategy as a result of that. It's all by itself. We'll obviously react as the environment around us changes. But as you pointed out, the business is performing really well right now. So job #1 for me is to just settle things down and make sure the business is and the business leaders at NBCU remain focused on the job at hand. And I feel actually into the first several days of this, but that's well underway. And I frankly don't think the business is going to miss a beat. With that, I'll hand it over to Dave.David N. WatsonThank you Mike. Ben, So on wireless, wireless continues to be a key part of our overall strategy. Stepping back for a second, we really like the start to the year in our trajectory. This quarter, we set another first quarter record in net line additions of 355,000. And so this puts us at the 5.7 million line. So a good start to the year. And we're still less than 10% penetrated to broadband, so it gives us a long runway ahead and to your point of looking out to '23. But our strategy is to focus very much on our core service offerings of By the Gig, which we still have and use, unlimited tiers. And it gives us a strong -- real strong value proposition to all segments that we serve. So it's important to note that we leverage mobile in all aspects of how we go to market, in acquisition, base management and retention. So mobile does very well in all 3. But as connects are a little bit softer through the cycle, base management has been very strong as we go to existing customers and provide a great upgrade opportunity for them. So our pricing focus is our core services, but we do go in and out in terms of promotions, with gift cards, some device subsidies that we've historically done, really no different there. But we also had a $50 combined broadband, mobile offering that all helped. There was a little bit of a lift there and a great value message to the existing base. So long term, less than 10% penetration, a lot of upside for us in wireless in a large revenue pool that we have, I think, a unique position given our broadband network is ubiquitous, our go-to-market mobile opportunity is ubiquitous within our footprint. And so you look at it, there's upside in residential and commercial. There's a domestic and international upside with mobile. There's an opportunity us to consider long-term cost side with offloading traffic. And then we have our existing capital-light MVNO, which we think is great and helps us compete footprint-wide. And then on top of all of that, we have Wi-Fi. That is just a terrific offload mechanism in and of itself. So as our competitors face trade-offs and whether it's geographic or capacity, we can go to market with one approach across our entire footprint, and wireless is a big part of that strategy. So we'll go in and out with offers, but we feel good about our momentum.Marci RyvickerThanks, Ben. Operator, next question please.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson.Craig Eder MoffettTwo questions if I could. First, you reported really exceptional margins in what would have been your old domestic Cable business. I'm wondering if you could just talk about the contribution to that improvement from wireless, the extent to which wireless is either offsetting the customer acquisition cost or just the gross margin rate and how that's impacting margins overall?And then on the NBCU side, the NBA playoffs have had exceptionally good ratings, and there's been a lot of talk about your potential interest in the NBA. I wonder if you could just discuss that a bit, and maybe just talk about what role sports might play as you go forward with Peacock and your NBC business?Jason S. ArmstrongThanks, Craig. It's Jason. Let me start with the margin question. I'll turn it over to Dave after that for some follow-up and then over to Mike on the NBA question. So on margins overall, pleased with the quarter. Obviously, we grew connectivity margins broadly by 160 basis points year-over-year. We've said in the domestic Cable business, margin's up 250 basis points to a record 46.5% strong margin performance. I think when we look at the drivers of that, number one, mix shift, high-margin businesses, i.e., the connectivity businesses, broadband, business services, wireless sort of in that category, a $10 billion book of business growing at 7%, and it's margin accretive. In addition to that, really strong expense management by Dave and the team. If you look at every expense category outside of direct product costs, which are the costs that go into feed the connectivity business growth, every single category down year-over-year. So I think really strong performance on margins in general. As we look at wireless, in particular, I'd put it in the broad bucket of the connectivity category. It obviously supports and augments broadband, which is one of our, if not the highest margin products. And so wireless is a contributor to that.David N. WatsonCraig, Dave here. So it does start -- if you look at the domestic margins, the 250 basis points and the 46.5%, there's a host of things. It all starts, as Jason said, with margin-accretive connectivity businesses, both residential and commercial. I think that we continue to benefit. There are -- transactional activity is lowered. A lot of this is just constantly being focused on the customer experience and taking out unnecessary transactions. That continues. But we're also very disciplined and stay focused on fixed costs. So that we look at every part of the business in terms of opportunities to do a good job, be competitive, be aggressive, but also take out unnecessary costs. And then there's also -- one of the things I think the good things that Cable does and we've been focused at Comcast is we leverage our existing network, our great network and our operational capabilities to do new lines of business. Business services is a great example of that, but wireless is another one, of which our existing sales channels, our existing capabilities in an MVNO-light way, it just -- it's a big part of the connectivity story. So I think we do well when we can leverage our strength, and our strength there will continue to be our network and our go-to-market approaches that we've done, I think, a pretty good job over the years. But everything we do, inbound sales, digital, we leverage wireless.Michael J. CavanaghAnd Craig, it's Mike. On NBA, obviously a tremendous product, and the playoffs are great. I think the negotiation is there. That's a ways out. But obviously, [NB] Sports does a great job partnering with the leagues we partner with, broadcast, streaming and otherwise. So time will tell. But as we look at things, we always look at a overall financial envelope. What's the right portfolio of overall sports rights we want to have and do that in a way that, as we've said and Jason said earlier, we manage linear, broadcast and Peacock as one business. So that's the way we would look at any of the rights that are out there in the future.OperatorOur next question comes from Doug Mitchelson with -- from Crédit Suisse.Douglas David MitchelsonTwo questions for Dave actually. First, on broadband. I'm just curious, both from a competition standpoint and a health of the consumer viewpoint, how voluntary and involuntary churn are trending and how the base reacted to the price increase this cycle versus prior cycles? And then secondly, I know it's relatively recent, but I'm just curious on the planned upgrades with 10G launched in February and progress in 40 markets that was highlighted in the slide show. If there's any kind of practical experience in the marketplace as to how the network is reacting and how the consumer is reacting post upgrades?David N. WatsonWell, thanks, Doug. So starting with competition and churn, so overall, the environment is -- there's still, as I mentioned, overall transactional activity in general is down. There's 2 parts of that. One is as you brought up, there's -- it continues to be pretty intense competitively. That's been the case for a while. But also, there's just less activity period with less moves. And so the thing that it really stands out continues to be the case that our churn is near record lows in terms of compared to pre-pandemic periods. So we're not seeing, in terms of churn, any material spikes when it comes to competition. We are seeing an impact in terms of connects. And so some of that is a transactional activity, some of it is competitive pressure, but it's more felt on the connect side of things and a little bit more on video as we have less video attachment on that side. But broadband, you look at our broadband base, we have a very stable base, 32 million residential broadband customers. Churn, very healthy and certainly lower than pre-pandemic period times. We watch the competitive landscape every day. And so while certain -- theres fixed wireless, the fiber group, but we continue to fare well in terms of kind of all tiers and in terms of churn. So it's not -- we haven't seen a spike in voluntary or the nonpay in regards to the economy. So -- but in terms of the network and the investments that we've made, we're pleased with our progress. We have about 20% of our footprint we've upgraded around the multi-gig capabilities that we have on track to continue that to over 30% come year-end and setting ourselves up very nicely for DOCSIS 4. At the end of the year, we'll be testing it. And I think next year will be a pretty big year for that. But every step of the way, we're delivering increased value. And it's where the customer is going in terms of the increased focus, every application of streaming, of gaming. And you look at where the customer is today, the 700 gigabits -- gigabytes in terms of HSD-only consumption, events like the Thursday Night Football that just caused a spike and then yesterday that Man City against Arsenal, Peacock, having a great Premier League match so that -- see a little bit of a bump in terms of broadband usage. So there's going to be more of that. The customer is going to do more with broadband, not less. And so I think that serves us well long term competitively, and we'll continue to be a champion of every single broadband great application as they come along.Brian L. RobertsThis is Brian. I just want to add one thought. The last point Dave made, I think you did a fabulous job explaining it. I just want to underscore how much I personally believe that, that's what makes us in a great position. If you think about less linear and more streaming, is that trend going to continue? Absolutely. It seems very, very likely. And who is best positioned to provide more and more capacity, and this path to 10G, we have a north star that we -- the team has created. We know what we want to bring to customers over the next several years. And as more and more needs come about, we're going to be the network there to deliver. So we're the provider of all that connectivity is a really special place to be.OperatorOur next question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with BofA Securities.Jessica Jean Reif Ehrlich CohenI have a bigger NBCU question and smaller cable. But Mike, you're the President of Comcast and the Head of NBCU. So 2 giant jobs. Is this a permanent solution? And in the meantime, obviously, the media landscape has changed drastically since you guys bought NBCU over a decade ago. So can you address the cyclical and secular challenges as well as opportunities, including, but I'm certainly not limiting it to a pending WGA strike, Disney's battle in Florida with Governor DeSantis that might affect Universal theme parks, the scale needed to compete in direct-to-consumer and the range of Hulu outcomes that would significantly affect your business, whether it's scaling up or cash coming in the door? And then the smaller cable question, sorry, is the video loss is accelerating. Do you have a point of view -- does this trend continue? Or is there a level of stability that you expect?Michael J. CavanaghOkay, Jessica, it's Mike. So I'll dive in. I think the short answer to the question is that I think what -- the way me stepping in to oversee NBC is quite sustainable. And why I say that is as President, I was already overseeing all of this and close to the people that run the NBC businesses and the Cable businesses and the corporate areas. And I think what's really important to understand is that we've got high-quality operators and leaders in all of the seats around the company: Philadelphia, L.A., New York, Orlando and so forth. So while I'll have to work a little harder and frankly, I'm energized to do so because I look forward actually to spending time getting closer to the NBCU businesses and spending more time deeper in them and with the leaders there. And frankly, since I'm going to be here for a long time, I actually think that's good for me and good for the company over the long term. So I would put no timetable at all on -- no time pressure to do anything other than make sure the businesses hum, which they're -- that's what they're doing right now, and that's what I see continuing. And maybe someday, we'll think there's a better way to approach it, but I'll never be moving far away from the businesses no matter what. And I'm going to own the outcome anyway it turns out. So I think -- think of me as being there for a while. In terms of the cyclical versus secular and the laundry list there of all the things we're dealing with, I'd say all that's embedded in the plans that we have. When you think about our Content &amp; Experiences businesses, you think about our Parks business, which is just doing tremendously well, and we've got tremendous growth investments behind that. And it had nothing to do with the challenges for eyeballs and the movement of traditional television to different forms of consumer consumption. So think of parks as -- put it aside, it is an incredibly valuable and growing business. And then I think in the traditional TV businesses, we're -- that's why we're -- exactly why we're doing Peacock. And remember, we're at 22 million subs now. We were 20 when we ended last year. We were 15 when we ended the third quarter of last year. So I think we're really pleased as we're 1 quarter into 2023 to have held level of engagement in the product, hours watched and so forth and kept churn very low. As we look ahead, some really good content coming later in the balance of the year. So on track, and then some. We'll have our role to pay and Comcast customers coming over to and more the second half of the year. So I think we feel really good about the strategy of how we're managing on the Media business side. And then really on Studios, you look at -- Brian covered it, but you look at the power of our Studios, both film and television. And they're incredibly strong, and leadership is excellent. And the -- Brian mentioned animation, but we've got Fast 10 coming out in a couple of weeks. We've had great hits on the television side and more to come. So I think that's also, I think, a strategy around Studios that is -- and we've stayed, as we've said, agnostic, I guess, to whether it's the word to use, whether things need to necessarily end on our platforms, Peacock or linear or someone else's. So I think there's durable value in that side of things sort of no matter how some of these trends work out. And I'll leave it at that and talk more some other day about some of the details. I'm not going to talk about Hulu. And on strikes, we certainly hope that we find an equitable outcome that avoids a strike, and that's what our team is planning for. Over to you, Dave.David N. WatsonYou got it. Jessica, Dave here. So on video, we continue to segment the marketplace. We have a lot of options. But the main point that has really developed is the video attachment being down. And so there -- and our rate approach is to not subsidize unprofitable video relationships. And I've shifted some time ago anticipating how things evolve that are focusing on the overall relationship and the connectivity opportunity. So the main -- one of the key points, though, that to make sure that folks understand, we did see certainly an uptick in customers dropping video. But we've also seen these customers that are retaining broadband. And so our full disconnect churn, video and broadband, remains at record low levels and is down nearly 25% since the pre-pandemic period. So we're able to have managed through the cycle. And still, there's some video packaging that we're going to be very focused on and based on the segment. And we'll fight hard, whether it's acquisition, base management or retention. So it's important to us, but we have figured out a way to manage it financially. And if you look at broadband, the net result is broadband is faring well and holding the line in terms of the base. And so as things continue to evolve more towards streaming, I think we're in a great position there. And we also have invested in our platforms. So we have the platforms of Flex. We have X1 and the new Charter JV with Xumo that we feel great about long term. So yes, the video losses did a bit of an uptick, but we did offset it with some of these platform relationships that I think long term are going to be very important.OperatorOur next question comes from Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs.Brett Joseph FeldmanSort of a 2-part question about connectivity CapEx. You seem pretty comfortable that you can continue this pace of footprint expansion within that CapEx profile you previously talked about. You also seem pretty happy with the traction you're having as you broaden the footprint.So I'm curious how you think about the merits of maybe building even faster, whether that's organically or if you would simply be waiting to see whether it makes sense to participate in some of these government subsidy programs. And then I think in the past, you provided some statistics about this enormously high share of your customers' true mobile traffic that happens in a very small portion of your geographic footprint. And that data point alone would imply that there's a very high ROI associated with deploying your own mobile infrastructure and bringing that on net. And you obviously have all the resources you need to do that, including spectrum. I'm curious why that hasn't happened yet? Or what would be the circumstances under which that could become a really attractive use of incremental capital investment in the connectivity business?Jason S. ArmstrongBrett, it's Jason. I'll start out with the CapEx question and then tag team with Dave on mobile offloading. So on CapEx, we guided for the year to 10% capital intensity. That's flat year-over-year last year for Connectivity &amp; Platforms. We rounded out the year at 10%. So flat year-over-year. If you think about the big categories that sort of contribute to capital intensity in that business, it's customer premise equipment, scalable infrastructure and line extensions. Customer premise equipment is actually an area we're getting some relief from. Scalable infrastructure, that's where our DOCSIS -- so that's basically existing infrastructure where we're augmenting capabilities. That's where DOCSIS 4.0 and our mid-splits. That's an area where, obviously, we're doing a lot more in the next couple of years. And then line extensions, I think you got it right. That's where we're extending our footprint to go serve new geographies, whether it's residential or business services. Within that, we've guided for the year 850,000 new builds last year, goes up to 1 million this year. So that's a 20% increase in what we're doing there, all accommodated for -- with similar capital intensity year-over-year. So I think we're really operating the business at a different level, given everything that's going on surrounding the network. I think to your question on doing even more as we look at some of the programs that are coming our way, if you look at prior programs and sort of our distinct advantages in the market, I would step back and say, as you look at product technology, management and cost of capital, those are things that should define an advantage for us in economics of new builds or overbuilds. It was a little bit muted in the prior cycle if you look at sort of the economic cycle we were in and low cost of capital, which created, we think, a pretty frothy capital markets environment, which led a lot of companies to stare at economics that may have been better temporarily than they might be over the longer term as well as newer government programs that were sort of, in our view, unseasoned in terms of the process. So it kept us out of -- lot of the prior programs. As we look at this going forward with capital markets activity, cost of capital going up a little bit, I think everything sort of plays to our strengths. So the 850,000 going to 1 million this year, we'd welcome it probably going higher over time.Michael J. CavanaghIt's Mike. I would just add in that we're not looking to manage within the around 11% as a constraint, but rather to Jason's point, I think we can handle going to the 1 million, which is great. And we see good economics in that, but would welcome it if the day came along that we thought spending more would -- on incremental passings would be good return. So...David N. WatsonAnd this is Dave. So Brett, we like the trajectory. Jason and Mike mentioned the 1 million. It's early, but off to a good start. I feel good about that. And really, the 3 buckets, the existing footprint within existing cable footprint and as things pick up in terms of housing and new construction, then we'll be right there, the hyper builds for commercial and then these edge outs, which is where some of the subsidies are there. So we're -- we feel good about it, very focused. And we'll take a disciplined approach, and it's been great, the support that we have in terms of every opportunity, we'll go for it. And -- but we'll expect historical returns. On the mobile offload, we think this is a really interesting and good opportunity potentially based on how things are. We've said, I think, 60%, the traffic around 3% of our footprint. And that is -- we're staring at that constantly. So we're testing. We have a -- we go arm in arm with Charter looking at some of these results in terms of how things are going. We do have a fantastic capital-light MVNO that serves us very well. I think great for the partner, good for us long term. But we'll continue to stare at the marginal cost improvements of offloading these dense traffic areas. So we're staying on it, and we'll -- more to come on that, but we'll be testing that throughout the year.OperatorWe'll go next to Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.Philip A. CusickTwo if I can. Maybe first following up on broadband. Jason, you mentioned success from a low-end broadband product at the end of the quarter. How do you see the return on that? And is it something you plan to sustain? How should we think about the impact in the second quarter versus typical seasonality? And then second, you mentioned that Orlando is trending above pre-COVID. Can you talk about recent trends in the domestic parks? Any indication of attendance shifts or costs?David N. WatsonPhil, Dave. Let me start with kind of the offer approach and then the impact as we go into Q2, just providing overall perspective. But when you take a step back, we are still in the environment that I've mentioned, still the base, overall broadband base very stable in terms of the turn, less the connect pressure that we've seen. So -- but the overall, it's tied to a better churn than where we were pre-pandemic. So -- but we take a very disciplined approach. We segment the market, and we go in and out with offers. So we did have an offer that was available in the marketplace where, for broadband only, at $25 and then a $50 combined mobile. And so we saw an uptick. It was positive. And so it's something that we constantly are doing coming in and out in terms of service offerings. We also remain very focused, what we talked about earlier around the high end and never losing sight that there's a mix of tiers that are really important to the base. And so we're just focused on 1 gig, and we do -- with part of the segmentation approach is going to the marketplace and 1/3 of our customers do take that 70 -- almost 75% of our customers take 400 megabits and above. So there's a blend that ends up happening, and that's why you saw a pretty good ARPU growth in terms of broadband. But we'll go in and out with offers in terms of things. We'll be nimble, respond competitively to every single segment. I think there's more action with fixed wireless on the low end and that -- the offer served us well. As you go into seasonality and you look at the second quarter, we are seeing typical seasonality, especially in regions like Florida. So you're going to see a step down in net adds from Q1 to Q2. And -- but I don't think you can extrapolate exact performance from historical levels. But directionally, net adds will be lower in Q2, so just to be clear.Jason S. ArmstrongJust to round out the question on broadband, Phil, because it's a good one. In this type of competitive environment, I think one of the key questions for us and the team is can we segment the base appropriately to sort of tactically respond at the low end but without disrupting the broader base. And one of the things I'm most proud of this quarter from the team is 4.5% ARPU growth, which I think really points to that.Michael J. CavanaghAnd it's a nice feel to finish on parks because the business overall is really rocking, as you can tell. It would be -- I'd be remiss in not calling out first the quarter that the international side had. USJ had all-time highs for attendance, per caps revenue and EBITDA. And that's since it opened -- for a first quarter. That's since it opened in 2001. And likewise, in China, we generated significant profitability in a tougher season and the highest ever quarterly attendance despite it being wintertime. So that's the international side. And on the domestic side, things continue to perform really well. Hollywood, we have Super Nintendo World open, so driving really strong attendance and per caps that are way ahead of last year and pre-pandemic levels on the back of excellent guest feedback. And in Orlando, really solid results in the quarter. We had, as you know, unprecedented visitation last year way ahead of 2019 pre-COVID. So as expected, growth rates have slowed down, but performance continues to be solid. And go-forward booking again still looks solid, similar pattern to Q1 of last year. So, so far, things continue to look good as we look ahead in the domestic side.Marci RyvickerThanks, Phil. That concludes our earnings call, and thank you all for joining us.Michael J. CavanaghThanks, everybody. Thank you.OperatorThat concludes the question-and-answer session and today's conference call.

Movie' hype",Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/comcast-stock-ticks-higher-following-203018334.html,1682627418,VIDEO,['CMCSA'],"[Yahoo Finance Live discusses a rise in Comcast stock following an earnings report which exceeded investor expectations after the success of the ""Super Mario Bros. Movie.""Video Transcript- So we are looking at Comcast. Shares of cable giant Comcast higher following an earnings beat this morning for the first quarter. Overall revenue was dinged a bit. But still, the numbers were better than expected. You're seeing Comcast perform quite well today, that stock surging double digits, up 10% on the day. Some of that growth in streaming. US paid Peacock subscribers jumped more than 60% year over year, so strong showing on the streaming side there at Comcast.- Yeah, theme park strong. New record of adjusted EBITDA for a first quarter. Brian Roberts did, as you would expect, comment on the departure of Jeff Shell, calling it a tough moment for the company. No word about a potential replacement or if they even will. But it sounds like if they will, it will come from in house.The big win there, you've got to talk about that movie ""Super Mario Brothers."" It is a huge performer for Universal. They are over the $900 million mark globally. And if you can believe this, on their way not just towards over a billion, which will happen in the next 24 to 48 hours, potentially becoming the highest grossing animated film of all time at this pace, which is really hard to wrap your mind around. When you think about ""Frozen,"" when you think about ""Lion King,"" when you think about iconic--- --movies. I know. ""Super Mario"" is going to be in there.- It may top them all.- Yes, it may. People want to go back to the movies. People are ready to just have that experience again, and Comcast the beneficiary of people returning en force to just things outside. We want to be outside. Outside has been open, and now people are just more excited about that.I haven't seen it yet. And I know-- it even sounds interesting to me. I mean, my kid saw it once. He's ready to see it again. So I guess Mommy's got a movie in store.Story continues- I'll check that one out. Now, the questions ahead. What happens with Hulu? That has been the question for quite some time with Comcast between they and Disney. No real indication about what's going to happen there.And the other big one is they expect to be a player in the NBA talks. There are, of course, the favorites-- ESPN and TNT Turner Sports, WBD-- hanging on as the existing rights holders. But NBC wants back into this game. It's expected to fetch between $50 and $75 billion per year for NBA rights. Can Comcast get in that league? Do they have that type of spending? Is Peacock starting to get close to revenue positive? A lot of questions for whomever might replace Jeff Shell or if it just stays in house.All right, I think we got some--- We've got some breaking earnings coming in right now, right?]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of value and dividend stocks and their performance in the past, and go directly to read 5 Value Stocks to Buy With High Dividend Yields. Value stocks trade at a price lower than their intrinsic or true value. These stocks are typically associated with companies that have solid fundamentals but are currently out of favor with investors, resulting in lower stock prices relative to their earnings, assets, and other metrics. Historically, growth stocks have beaten value stocks for the most part, however, value investment strategy has proven to be successful over the long term. Bank of America estimated that value investing has returned 1,344,600% since 1926, whereas growth stocks delivered a 626,000% return during the same period.The historical performance of value and growth stocks has varied over time, with periods of outperformance for each strategy. During years of high inflation, investors turn toward stocks with lower valuations and high dividend yields, which results in the solid performance of value stocks. Last year’s consistent interest rate hikes have given value equities their much-awaited comeback after underperforming growth securities for over a decade. According to a report by T. Rowe Price, the MSCI World Value Index outperformed its growth counterpart by over 20 percentage points last year. The report also mentioned that periods of high-interest rates create broader earnings growth in equity markets, resulting in a strong performance of value stocks.In one of our articles titled 11 Best Undervalued Dividend Stocks to Buy Now, we reported that value stocks surpassed growth equities by 18 percentage points in the first 10 months of 2022.Another report by Schroders revealed that periods of economic slowdown bode well for value stocks in the past. The asset management company gave a positive outlook on value investing and mentioned that value equities will outperform the broader market by 11.8% cumulatively over the next three years.Story continuesDividend stocks are also grabbing investors’ attention in addition to value stocks. Some of the best dividend stocks such as The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) are popular because these companies have rewarded shareholders with decades of dividend growth and have strong cash flows.13 Value Stocks to Buy With High Dividend YieldsImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur Methodology:For this list, we used the Finviz stock screener to identify dividend stocks with yields above 7%, as of April 26.

We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had a material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies lead us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is mostly variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Value Stocks to Buy With High Dividend Yields.  Suggested articles:14 Best Income Stocks To Invest In10 Best Auto Parts Stocks to Buy Now10 Cheap AI Stocks to Buy in 2023Disclosure.

In fact, when it comes to dividend stocks, you should be less concerned about dividend yield and more about dividend growth. The emphasis will always remain on high quality since a lot of companies do make dividend payments but often scale back once the payout ratio is too high. When looking for the top dividend growth stocks for your portfolio, consider the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (NYSEARCA: VIG) — the largest U.S.-listed dividend ETF. It tracks the performance of the S&amp;P U.S. Dividend Growers Index and has a large collection of dividend-paying stocks with a record of increasing their dividends. Better, when you choose high-quality companies with strong dividend growth, you’ll notice that the dividend grows whenever earnings grow. The trick is to focus on the best names in the industry which have a strong track record of dividend growth and consistent payouts. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLet’s take a look at the three dividend stocks with huge return potential for long-term investors. KOCoca-Cola$63.95DVNDevon Energy$54.47NEENextEra Energy$79.04Dividend Stocks: Coca-Cola (KO)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockAt the top of my list is the dividend aristocrat Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). A well-established company with a solid reputation in the industry, Coca-Cola is known for dependable dividends and impressive earnings growth. KO stock is trading for $64 today and is up 11% in the past six months. The stock hasn’t gone to impressive highs nor has it slumped too low. It was trading for $38 in March 2020 and has steadily grown since. KO stock hasn’t gone below $54 since Oct. 2022 and I believe the momentum will continue. As a long-term investor in KO stock, you will be able to enjoy passive income through steady dividends over the years. If you are into dividend investing, this is one stock to own. It has a yield of 2.94% and recently announced a quarterly dividend of 46 cents a share or $1.84 annualized which is why it is one of the best long-term dividend stocks to own. Story continuesAnother reason to bet on Coca-Cola is its potential to thrive even during a pandemic, market uncertainty, or a recession. No matter where the economy goes from here, there will be people who will still consume beverages and this is where Coca-Cola will benefit. It already has over 36% market share in North America and is set to expand there. In the past two decades, the stock has returned more than 396%. The company has also beaten estimates in the past four quarters and is set to report results today. Wall Street Analysts are also bullish on the stock. Barclays analyst Lauren Lieberman has raised the price target of the stock to $72 and has an Overweight rating ahead of the results.Devon Energy (DVN)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large text.Source: iQoncept/shutterstock.comDevon Energy (NYSE:DVN) is a hydrocarbon exploration company located in Oklahoma City. DVN stock is one of the top dividend stocks with huge return potential for long-term investors. It is trading at $53 today and is a great bargaining opportunity right now since it is trading much lower than the all-time high of $79. The stock is down 4% over the past year and down 7% year to date. It has a forward yield of 6.63% and a payout ratio of over 51%. In the last quarter, the company declared a dividend of $0.89. The company increases and decreases the dividends in line with the earnings but with a surge in oil prices, the company has managed to reward investors. Oil is going high soon and OPEC has announced production cuts which has led to a rise in oil prices, which will benefit the company. Yes, the dividend will be variable and oil prices could find an equilibrium in the near future, but this is one company that has the potential to continue rewarding shareholders. It is one of the high-yield dividend stocks to consider.DVN stock has generated more than 1500% returns for investors in the last three decades. In the annual results, it revealed a fixed 11% dividend increase for 2023 which can be significantly rewarding for investors. Moreover, Wall Street analysts are bullish on the stock. Raymond James has a price target of $70 with a Strong Buy rating since the firm expects an in-line quarter with the production also falling in line. Further, Piper Sandler analyst Mark Lear has a price target of $87 with an Overweight rating. The company is set to report results on May 9. NextEra Energy (NEE)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockThe world is moving towards renewable energy and NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is one of the top renewable energy stocks to own. If you are looking for one stock that has a steady dividend payout and massive potential for capital appreciation, consider investing in NEE stock. The company owns massive wind and solar power networks through which it provides power to millions of customers. No matter the economic situation, NEE stock is set to thrive. It is trading for $78 and is up 7% in the past six months. The stock has generated over 92% returns in the past five years and I believe this is only the beginning. Financially, the company has a net margin of 19.79% and a dividend yield of 2.37%. The company recently announced a dividend of $0.47 and aims to increase the dividend per share by 10% per year through at least 2024.For 2023, it expects an adjusted EPS ranging from $2.98 to $3.13. Erste Group analyst Stephan Lingnau has a Buy rating for the stock while 11 analysts at Tipranks have a buy rating and only 1 has a hold rating with a price target of $91.73, a 16% upside from the current level. On the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Shares have lost about 4% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Micron due for a breakout?

The company reported a non-GAAP loss of $1.91 per share, which was significantly higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 67 cents.  The bottom line compared unfavorably with the prior-year quarter’s earnings of $2.14 per share.The quarterly revenues of Micron plunged 53% year over year to $3.69 billion, which missed the consensus mark of $3.76 billion. Rapidly weakening consumer demand and substantial customer inventory adjustments across end markets amid macroeconomic uncertainty were the main reasons behind the dismal quarterly performance.Q2 Top-Line DetailsDRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) revenues of $2.72 billion, accounting for 74% of the total revenues in the fiscal second quarter, declined 52% year over year and 4% sequentially. Bit shipments increased approximately in the mid-teens percentage sequentially, while the average selling price (ASP) plunged approximately 20% on a quarter-over-quarter basis.NAND revenues of $885 million, representing 24% of the total top line, were down 55% on a year-over-year basis and 20% quarter over quarter. While NAND ASP decreased in the mid-20 percentage sequentially, bit shipments increased in the mid-to-high-single-digit percent range.Other revenues were 2% of total revenues of $86 million in the reported quarter.Segment-wise, revenues of $1.38 billion from the Computing and Networking Business Unit plunged 60% from the year-ago quarter and 21% sequentially. Revenues of $945 million from the Mobile Business Unit declined 50% on a year-over-year basis but increased 44% on a quarter-over-quarter basis.Story continuesThe Embedded Business Unit’s revenues logged in at $865 million, down 32% from the year-ago period and 14% from the previous quarter. Revenues from the Storage Business Unit, comprising solid-state drive NAND components, totaled $507 million, down 57% year over year and 25% sequentially.Operating DetailsFor the second quarter, Micron posted a non-GAAP gross loss of $1.16 billion, while it reported a non-GAAP gross profit of $3.72 billion in the year-ago quarter and $934 million in the previous quarter. The non-GAAP gross margin of -31% reflects a significant decline from the year-ago quarter’s 48% and 23% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.Micron’s non-GAAP operating loss of $2.08 billion compared unfavorably with the non-GAAP operating income of $2.75 billion in the prior-year quarter.

427,13e0dece-3348-3c60-af50-fc395a9f0678,MU,2023-04-28,Tech war: Beijing's cybersecurity review into US memory chip maker Micron opens opportunity for Chinese suppliers to fill gap in market,South China Morning Post,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-war-beijings-cybersecurity-review-093000291.html,1682587800,STORY,"['MU', 'SSNLF']","[China's cybersecurity review into Micron Technology, the United States' largest memory chip maker, has opened an opportunity for mainland suppliers, led by Yangtze Memory Technologies Co (YMTC), to plug any potential gap in the market, according to local analysts and merchants.With heightened tensions between Washington and Beijing expected to affect the mainland businesses of South Korean memory chip giants Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix, a possible ban on the sale of Micron products in China could enable YMTC and other local suppliers to fill the void left by the US firm in the market, according to Chen Jia, a researcher at Renmin University of China in Beijing.""In the memory chip sector, China has basically solved the bottleneck problem,"" Chen said.Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.Some merchants at Pacific Digital Plaza, one of the largest computer shopping centres in Shanghai and a major hub for sourcing electronic components, recently expressed a similar view.Pacific Digital Plaza, located in downtown Shanghai, is one of the city's largest sourcing hubs for electronic components. Photo: Ann Cao alt=Pacific Digital Plaza, located in downtown Shanghai, is one of the city's largest sourcing hubs for electronic components. Photo: Ann Cao&gt;At a small kiosk that sells a wide range of electronic components on the first floor of Pacific Digital Plaza, 30-year-old vendor Liu Bei said ""Samsung is still the best choice"" when buying a solid-state drive (SSD) - a storage device that typically uses a flash memory chip.But he also indicated that local SSD products, such as those from YMTC and Shenzhen KingBank Technology Co, have become good alternatives to Samsung. ""You can find very few distributors for Micron or other brands in the market,"" he said.Story continuesWithout providing any details, other merchants at the electronics hub indicated that domestic memory chip suppliers like YMTC, which have set lower prices than their foreign rivals, have increased competition in the market.They added that the local inventory of memory products has not been affected by Beijing's Micron review because of an abundant supply of devices from alternative mainland sources.On March 31, the Cyber Security Review Office, under the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), launched an investigation into Micron products sold on the mainland to ""safeguard key information infrastructure supply chain security"" and ""prevent cyberspace security risks due to problematic products"".Neither the Chinese government nor Micron have provided further information on the investigation. Micron, which had earlier said it was ""in communication with the CAC and cooperating fully"", is the first foreign semiconductor company to be put under a cybersecurity review by China.That review marks a ""major concern"" for other companies operating in the country, according to a statement this week from Lester Ross, chair of the policy committee at the American Chamber of Commerce in China.While the Micron investigation threatens to ratchet up Sino-US tensions, the situation has also helped boost the profile of YMTC and other Chinese suppliers in terms of how they can quickly meet the local market's requirements.An aerial view of Micron Technology's headquarters and main production complex in Boise, Idaho. Photo: Shutterstock alt=An aerial view of Micron Technology's headquarters and main production complex in Boise, Idaho. Photo: Shutterstock&gt;These mainland suppliers have cut memory product prices to help expand their market share. On the JD.com e-commerce platform, Shenzhen Fanxiang Information Technology Co, which uses YMTC's memory chips, sells a 2-terabyte SSD for 509 yuan (US$73.50), or about half the price of a Samsung SSD with the same capacity that costs 1,049 yuan.A long list of Chinese SSD brands on JD.com - including ZhiTai, Move Speed, Gloway and Maxsun - already claim to use YMTC memory chips as part of their marketing pitch.YMTC, which was added to the US trade blacklist last December, plans to use locally sourced chip-making equipment to make advanced flash memory products, according to a South China Morning post report on Sunday, citing industry sources.If that YMTC project, code-named Wudangshan, proves successful, it would represent a breakthrough in China's efforts to become self-sufficient in semiconductor production, as US-led restrictions have blocked mainland companies' access to advanced chip-making equipment because of national security concerns.That development comes amid reports this week that Washington has asked Seoul to press South Korean memory chip makers not to fill any market gap in China if Beijing ends up banning Micron product sales on the mainland.Such a move to abandon the mainland, however, would run against business rationale for South Korean chip companies if and when a ban on Micron gets implemented, according to Renmin University's Chen.Echoing that assessment, the director at research institute Shendu Technology, Zhang Xiaorong, said: ""Now that the global consumer electronics market is going down, chip companies are counting on the Chinese market to drive growth.""Samsung, for example, reported on Thursday a record quarterly loss of 4.58 trillion won (US$3.4 billion) at its chip division, punctuating concerns about a broad tech downturn. South Korea's largest company saw its revenue from China decline from 16 per cent to 12 per cent between 2017 and 2022, according to its latest annual report.The global memory market is forecast to reach US$92.3 billion this year, down 35.5 per cent from 2022, because of an ""overcapacity of chips and excess inventory"", according to tech research firm Gartner.For Micron, with sales on the mainland and Hong Kong accounting for 16 per cent of its total revenue in 2022, a ban on its products in the world's largest semiconductor market would be the firm's ""worst-case scenario"" amid ""slumping demand in the [global] memory market"", said Arisa Liu, a research fellow and director focused on semiconductors at the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research.Additional reporting by Che PanThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

428,f3d3346e-c851-38b8-b7ba-6ef8e7165d0a,MU,2023-04-28,Steer Clear of NVDA Stock Amid the Chipmaker’s Crypto Conundrum,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/steer-clear-nvda-stock-amid-204030461.html,1682368830,STORY,"['NVDA', 'INTC', 'MU']","[Although Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is likely to be significantly hurt by the probable collapse of the crypto market, the company’s upcoming positive catalysts should more than outweigh the crypto implosion. Therefore, I expect NVDA stock to outperform the market over the next year.Still, there are reasons to be cautious when it comes to Nvidia. A high exposure to crypto and relatively high valuation for NVDA stock leads me to believe competitors could outperform from here. Accordingly, here are three other chip names I think investors should consider instead.Nvidia’s Powerful, Positive CatalystsAs I noted in a recent article, “HSBC analyst Frank Lee upgraded NVDA stock to ‘buy’ from ‘reduce'” and hiked his price target on the shares to $355 from $175. According to the bank, Nvidia’s chips that power artificial intelligence are fetching prices “between 10 and 20 times higher than the average gaming” graphics processing unit. Those extremely high prices, driven by the very rapid proliferation of AI, are going to boost Nvidia’s financial results and NVDA stock tremendously.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMoreover, the demand for chips that enable AI is expected to increase going forward. According to one study, the spending on such chips is expected to soar to $36.8 billion in 2025 from $16.86 billion last year.Meanwhile, as I pointed out in a previous column, “electrification and the proliferation of advanced driver-assistance systems” is causing chip demand from automakers to jump. So, it’s not surprising to see Nvidia’s Automotive and Embedded unit revenue soar 135% year-over-year in Q4 of 2022. Further, Nvidia is doubling down on its auto business correctly, by partnering with Chinese manufacturing powerhouse Foxconn. This partnership is aimed at developing “automated and autonomous vehicle platforms.”Story continuesFinally, Citi believes that the demand for chips from data centers and smartphone makers will “stabilize” in the second half of this year. Of course, that development will be very positive for Nvidia and NVDA stock.The Crypto ThreatIn line with my previous predictions, Washington seems determined to shut down crypto trading. The Securities and Exchange Commission has taken legal action against many crypto exchanges. On Apr. 17, the SEC “charged crypto asset trading platform Bittrex, Inc. and its co-founder and former CEO William Shihara for operating an unregistered national securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency.” Last month, it issued a Wells notice to Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN). And the Fed has strongly discouraged banks from getting involved with crypto.In my view, it appears that Washington is looking to make it very difficult, if not impossible, for anyone to trade crypto. Of course, such a situation will cause the value of cryptos to crash. Additionally, this could negatively impact the demand for Nvidia’s chips, which are used to mine crypto.Nvidia refuses to estimate the amount of revenue it obtains from crypto miners. However, last November, Nvidia’s CFO stated that the demand for “some” of its chips was affected by only a change in how Ethereum (ETH-USD) is mined. As a result, it seems clear that a near-cessation of crypto mining would have a meaningful, adverse effect on NVDA stock.Valuation and Better BetsClearly, NVDA stock comes with a rather steep valuation. Currently, the company’s shares are changing hands at a forward price-earnings ratio of 60-times. Additionally, the company’s impressively high enterprise value-EBITDA ratio of 111-times won’t have value investors lining up for NVDA stock. Accordingly, between the company’s high valuation and crypto headwinds, I don’t think NVDA stock will deliver tremendous returns over the next six months.Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Micron (NASDAQ:MU) and ON Semiconductors (NASDAQ:ON) are three chip makers who also have solid and positive catalysts. However, these chip stocks trade at valuations that are orders of magnitude lower.Intel’s Habana Labs unit has positioned the company nicely to become a “big player” in AI. Furthermore, I think the company should benefit significantly from Washington’s subsidies. With an enterprise value/EBITDA ratio of just 7-times, that’s the kind of chip stock that makes sense.Micron has said that it’s also poised to generate a great deal of revenue from AI, while Citi believes that the prices of its memory products will surge in the second half of the year. Like Intel, Micron has an EV/EBITDA ratio of just 7-times.Finally, ON Semiconductor benefits from the increasing demand for chips by its core auto and industrial markets, while its forward price-earnings ratio is just 18.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Chris?Story continuesChristian CocksThanks, Debbie, and good morning. Six months ago, we unveiled our strategy for Hasbro, highlighting 3 priorities: focusing on fewer bigger brands and initiatives; building our consumer insight to grow share and drive innovation; and improving operational excellence to fuel bottom-line health and strategic reinvestment. It's a plan that recenters Hasbro on what has made us great for the past 100 years and which will serve as our foundation going forward: Play. Put simply, play is what we do. And as we celebrate our 100th anniversary, 2023 is about refocusing our teams to drive renewed leadership in toys and games, rightsizing our entertainment investments and driving fundamental improvements in our organization to deliver long-term success. With our strategy top of mind, let's review our Q1 results. As anticipated, Q1 revenue was lower year-over-year, but ahead of expectations, driven by continued positive performance of Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming and another strong growth quarter for MAGIC: THE GATHERING. Revenue for the quarter was $1 billion, a year-over-year decline of 14%. Adjusted operating profit was $47.2 million, and adjusted earnings per share were $0.01. Wizards and Digital Gaming net revenue increased 12% year-over-year, with growth in both Magic and D&amp;D. MAGIC: THE GATHERING was a standout performer, growing 16%, particularly impressive given its 40% growth in Q4. The fundamentals of Magic, Hasbro's first billion-dollar brand are strong with new player growth, player engagement and player sentiment all pointing in the right direction. We expect the positive momentum for Magic to continue with Q1 also seeing one of our most successful preorders ever for our upcoming Universes Beyond, The Lord of the Rings: Tales of the Middle-Earth set, which will launch in late Q2. Given our release calendar, we expect revenue for Magic to be down in Q2, but up solidly in Q3 and for the full year. Consumer Products revenue declined 23% year-over-year. Point of sale was down for the quarter but improved from Q4 despite exiting several unprofitable businesses and licenses. PLAY-DOH, PEPPA PIG and Hasbro Gaming saw POS gains in Q1. And we drove late quarter growth in Action, particularly in Transformers as excitement amounts for the June release of the TRANSFORMERS: Rise of the Beast feature film. Beyond Transformers, we have a blockbuster lineup of content from our partners' brands helping to support sales in the back half of the year, including Season 3 of Lucasfilm; The Mandalorian, Star Wars: Ahsoka, Star Wars: Young Jedi Adventures, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, Marvel Studios' Guardians of the Galaxy 3 and Sony's Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. Importantly, we ended the quarter with good progress on reducing retailer inventories and are on track for healthy improvements in our owned inventory in Q2 and Q3.Entertainment segment revenues were off 19%, driven by year-over-year shifts in release timing of new film and family brands content. Among new Hasbro content released, we debuted our new preschool brand, Kiya and the Kimoja Heroes on Disney Jr. and Disney+, and launched with our partners at Paramount, the new feature film Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves. D&amp;D took the #1 spot to the global office in its release week and has become Hasbro's best reviewed film ever, with an impressive 91% critic score and 93% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes. Based on the strong fan and audience response, we are expecting Honor Among Thieves to enjoy a long viewing life that introduces our newest franchise brand to tens of millions of new consumers globally via theaters, streaming and post theatrical sales. Our operational excellence program continues apace. As we execute our plans, we expect the cost savings to grow over the coming quarters. In Q1, we achieved $35 million of cost savings. We continue to expect $150 million of run rate gross cost savings this year, money we are using to reinvest in the business, offset margin impacts from inventory management programs, and help us achieve our full year target of 50 to 70 basis points of adjusted operating profit improvement.We made significant progress in recasting our leadership team to drive our strategy. Gina Goetter, the CFO of Harley-Davidson and 25-plus year consumer packaged goods veteran, joins us in May as our new CFO and leader of our global operations disciplines. Gina has a long history with corporate transformations, which will serve Hasbro well. Tim Kilpin, a 30-plus-year veteran with leadership experiences across marquee toy, games and entertainment brands, joins us as our new President of Toy, Licensing and Entertainment. Jason Bunge, the former Chief Marketing Officer of Riot Games, joins us as our new global CMO, bringing new marketing firepower for our games and data-driven growth initiatives. And Bertie Thompson, Chief Communications and Creative Officer at Notion and former Communications Executive at Meta, joins us as our new Chief Communications Officer, bringing cutting-edge technology, social media and financial markets communications expertise. These talented leaders joined an extended leadership team, hailing from technology, CPG, toys, games and entertainment companies to drive our strategy and build profitable blueprints across our Franchise and Partner Brands. Our growth initiatives continue to deliver. Hasbro's total games portfolio grew 2% in the quarter. Direct-to-consumer revenues increased 21%, led by a 46% increase at Hasbro Pulse, our fan-focused direct-to-consumer e-commerce platform. And on licensing, we just announced our first-ever agreement with Mattel, including crossovers for Barbie and MONOPOLY and Hot Wheels, UNO and Transformers. Partnerships like this, along with our previously announced licensing deals with LEGO on Transformers and D&amp;D, expand our brands, introduce our toys and games into new categories and leverage our own category leadership for new growth opportunities. For the full year, we are maintaining our previous guidance of a low single-digit revenue decline and adjusted operating profit margin expansion of 50 to 70 basis points. We continue to expect Q2 to present headwinds as retailers return to traditional ordering and shipment patterns and release timings for new Magic sets favoring Q3 impacts Wizards of the Coast sales. We're cautiously optimistic with the progress we have made in Q1, but still maintain an outlook of a flat to down toy and games market where focus, share building and bottom line health are Hasbro priorities. On the sale of our non Hasbro-branded E1 film and TV assets, we continue to be pleased by the progress and expect to provide an update in Q2. In summary, while Q1 is just the start, we delivered ahead of plan and continue to see steady progress in building our leadership team, focusing the company and improving our operational fundamentals. Magic is strong. The fan economy is proving resilient. Our entertainment calendar is robust, and our growth initiatives are on track. I'd now like to turn over the call to our Chief Financial Officer, Deb Thomas, to share more details. Deb?Deborah M. ThomasThank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. As Chris said, first quarter results were ahead of our expectations and position us to meet our full year guidance. Wizards of the Coast, led by strong MAGIC: THE GATHERING demand, continued to perform well. Our consumer products teams are working through retail inventory and setting for major entertainment releases, and our operational excellence program is delivering savings and helping offset these expenses.As you know, the first quarter is a historically small quarter for our business and most of the year remains ahead. In Q1, our fixed cost base is disproportionate to revenue. This impacts our profit early in the year, but we see improvement in future quarters as revenue grows and as we begin to actualize more of our cost savings. In Q1, we realized an additional $35 million in savings and remain on track to deliver $150 million of run rate savings in 2023. In addition, this is a 53-week fiscal year, and the first quarter holds that extra week. And this equaled $14 million of incremental expense on Little revenue. Given our first quarter, we now expect revenue in the first half of 2023 to be down approximately 16% versus our previously forecasted 20% decline. For the full year, we continue to expect a low single-digit revenue decline in 50 to 70 basis points of adjusted operating profit margin improvement. We started the year with a cash balance of $513 million. $89 million of operating cash flow in the quarter was offset by nonoperating outflows, including $30 million of long-term debt repayment, $53 million of CapEx led by investments in Wizards of the Coast for future gaming releases and a $97 million return of capital through dividends to our shareholders. We ended Q1 with $386 million in cash. We forecast operating cash flow for the year in the $600 million to $700 million range. We have sufficient cash flow and liquidity to operate our business, meet our CapEx needs, invest for growth and fund our dividend.At quarter end, inventory at Hasbro is up from year-end, due primarily to 2 items: the first being higher Wizards of the Coast inventories given the timing of releases this year, with March of the Machine release mid-April and Universes Beyond: The Lord of the Rings, Tales of the Middle-Earth shortly before the start of Q3. By year-end, we expect Wizards' inventories to be down. The second increase comes from our Consumer Product inventories. While we're working through our own inventory from year-end, we purchased Action figures to set at retail for upcoming entertainment launches, including Transformers: Rise of the Beast.We made good progress reducing retail inventories in Q1, and they are down from year-end. We continue to expect it will take the first half of the year to work through the excess. The cost savings work we began last year are heavily weighted to our supply chain and are offsetting these costs, resulting in slightly better cost of sales margins compared to Q1 2022. Once we work through the inventory and our sales allowances return to normalized levels, we expect those cost savings will begin to drop to the bottom line. This should begin in the second half of the year. The sale of the noncore TV and film assets is progressing. And while we expect to be able to provide an update on the transaction in the second quarter, a closing and related cash inflow is likely to happen in the second half of this year. We will prioritize the sale proceeds of the entertainment assets toward paying down debt, lowering our overall debt levels, reducing our ongoing interest expense and improving our debt-to-EBITDA ratio. We continue to target debt-to-EBITDA of 2 to 2.5x, and we remain committed to our investment-grade rating.Looking at our adjusted results for the first quarter, revenue came in ahead of our plan, with strong MAGIC: THE GATHERING demand and slightly better shipments in our Consumer Products business. Foreign exchange had a negative $15.8 million impact on revenues. Cost of sales declined in line with revenue and decreased 10 basis points year-over-year. As I mentioned, the incremental expense for closeouts and allowances is being offset by operational excellence cost savings. Favorable product mix behind growth in Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming revenue, as well as CP licensing, contributed to improvements in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue.Program amortization expense declined on lower entertainment deliveries in the year, but increased 30 basis points as a percent of revenue. Royalty expense declined on lower partner brand revenues as we exited certain licenses and, to a lesser extent, from lower E1 revenues in title mix. In the second quarter, operating profit will be impacted as we expect royalty expense of approximately 10% of revenue. This is an additional $45 million versus Q1 as we ship products in support of Transformers: Rise of the Beast and MAGIC, Universes Beyond: The Lord of the Rings set. For the full year, we expect royalty expense to decline from 8.4% in 2022. Product development expense increased due to team supporting our Wizards of the Coast tabletop and digital development who joined the company in the back half of last year. Advertising investment increased on support for Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves within our Entertainment segment, and at Wizards of the Coast for both D&amp;D and MAGIC. Adjusted SG&amp;A spend was essentially flat but increased as a percentage of revenue. Lower freight costs and cost savings from mid-Q1 workforce reductions were offset by higher investment in Wizards including personnel, organized play events such as conventions and tournaments and marketing for upcoming releases.As a reminder, we expect to achieve more normalized levels of incentive compensation in 2023 throughout the year, which we estimate to be approximately $80 million versus 2022, with $65 million in SG&amp;A and the balance in product development. Due to the mix of earnings and lower income in the quarter, combined with discrete items mostly related to stock-based compensation, our adjusted tax rate for the quarter at 83.8% is not indicative of the year. The outsized impact from small discrete items will normalize with higher income. For the full year 2023, we continue to expect our underlying adjusted rate to be between 20% and 21%. Looking at our segments, Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming revenue increased 14% in constant currency. The team is focused on creating gaming experiences MAGIC and D&amp;D fans embrace. Tabletop revenues were up 13% behind popular MAGIC: THE GATHERING releases. Digital Gaming revenue increased 9%, led by the addition of D&amp;D beyond. As we continue to invest in Wizards of the Coast, operating profit declined 28% due to higher product costs, product development, personnel costs, advertising expense and costs supporting the return of organized play. We continue to expect full year operating profit margin for the segment in the high 30% range, which reflects investment for future growth and expansion of our Universes Beyond products. Consumer Products segment revenue decreased 21%, excluding a negative $8.3 million impact of foreign exchange, $6.2 million of which was in Europe. This performance was led by lower revenues in North America and Europe, partially offset by growth in Asia Pacific, Latin America and licensing. The segment's adjusted operating loss is the result of lower net revenue and includes higher allowances and closeouts to sell-through inventory. We expect these higher costs to continue in the second quarter. These items were partially offset by savings realized from the company's operational excellence program reflected primarily in cost of sales. Entertainment segment revenue decreased 17% in constant currency. TV revenues increased behind scripted TV deliveries including the new series, The Rookie: Feds and The Rookie, which ABC just renewed for a sixth season; Yellowjackets; and The Recruit, and lower unscripted TV revenue. Film revenues declined with fewer new releases in 2023 versus 2022. Family Brands revenue declined due to content sales timing year-over-year, including several multiyear licensing deals executed in Q1 2022 that did not repeat this year. Music and other decline as we exited the remainder of these businesses in late 2022. Adjusted operating loss was the result of lower revenues as well as higher advertising for Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves, partially offset by lower royalty expense. As I said upfront, Q1 was a good but small quarter with a lot of the year ahead of us. Our outlook is predicated on the second half that improves year-over-year. We remain cautious about the macro and the consumer environment, but the timing of theatrical releases, a strong MAGIC release schedule, the return to a more traditional and back half weighted shipment plan to retailers, innovation we have planned and we'll share more about this summer and engaging retail and advertising campaigns to improve point-of-sale all support our view. It's hard to imagine that this is my last earnings call as Hasbro's CFO. I have been here for 25 years, and we've been through the good and the tough. I've had the opportunity to work with outstanding people on amazing brands, and I know Chris, Gina and Tim and our entire team will take good care of Hasbro and its legacy. Thank you all for your support of Hasbro and for your partnership over the years. Now one last time, I'll turn it back to Chris.Christian CocksThanks, Deb. Before we turn it over to Q&amp;A, I'd like to spend a minute thanking Deb Thomas for her 25 years of leadership at Hasbro. I started this company 7 years ago as the fresh-faced leader of an under-the-radar subsidiary called Wizards of the Coast. From my first day on the job, there was no bigger supporter of Wizards than Deb. She got it, and was always there for Rookie, helping me navigate the broader company and giving me and the team at Wizards the support we needed to turbocharge that business. My story is the same story thousands of people across the company have about Deb. She is the true definition of a servant leader: The first one in the office in the morning; the last one to turn the lights off in the evening; and a true believer in the power of our people and brands. Deb has been an invaluable partner who has helped Hasbro become one of the biggest and best companies in the toys and games and broader entertainment industry.Deb, it's been an honor to work with, partner and learn from you over the years. Our company and our shareholders owe you a debt gratitude. On behalf of everyone at Hasbro, and especially me, thank you. Now we will take your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Andrew Uerkwitz with Jefferies.Andrew Paul UerkwitzI guess a question on MAGIC. Could you just kind of help us understand like the audience segmentation with The Lord of the Rings set coming, who are you targeting? And it looks like the strategy around that set is a little different than what we've seen.Christian CocksYes. Thanks, Andrew. And hey, great report, by the way, on MAGIC. We all had a chance to read that earlier this week, but it was well researched and did a good job of reviewing the brand. So on Lord of the Rings, as we've talked about for our overall strategy for Universes Beyond, it's all about bringing in adjacent fandoms. We've had great success with this, with D&amp;D, which was kind of a prototype for Universes Beyond that we did a couple of years ago, the summer set called Adventures in the Forgotten Realms. We've had one of our best-selling commander sets ever with Warhammer that we did this fall. We're already on our fourth reprint. And for Lord of the Rings, it's really about appealing to those -- that rabid fan base who loves Lord of the Rings, who loves J.R.R. Tolkien, and who also might love a game like MAGIC: THE GATHERING. I think an important secondary component to that is that there's already a whole bunch of MAGIC: THE GATHERING fans who are big kind of fantasy, uber fans. They like The Lord of the Rings, and we see it as a great engagement opportunity for them and a special collector's experience for a set that we don't do very often.Andrew Paul UerkwitzGot it. That's helpful. And then just my one follow-up. Could you kind of just give us an update? You have Baldur's Gate launching, I think, in Q3. Could you give us an update on expectations, how that will monetize through the income statement? And then just broadly an update on the video game strategy.Christian CocksYes. So Baldur's Gate 3 is being done by our partners at Larian. Larian is probably one of the -- arguably one of the best independent role-playing game publishers in the world. And so we're really excited about what they can do. They released Baldur's Gate 3 into Early Access on Steam about 2.5, 3 years ago. To date, it's the most successful Early Access game in Steam's history with well over 1 million adopters, just in that kind of like preview period. So we have pretty high expectations for Baldur's Gate 3. We think the quality is going to be very, very high. If you look at the reviews on Steam, they're excellent. It definitely is going to be a game of the year, or at least a role-playing game of the year contender, and it's going to release very broadly on consoles and PC. So we think it's going to be a pretty big release. In terms of how we participate in that, it's a license product for us. We like kind of the partnership that we have with Larian on that. So we'll start to see some contribution from that in the later, like probably September in Q3. And then more meaningfully just based on kind of the timing of when we recognize the license royalty-based revenue, in Q4 and Q1 of next year.OperatorOur next question is from Eric Handler with ROTH MKM.Eric Owen HandlerI'll just say, Deb, just good luck in all your future endeavors, and you'll be missed. So first question, with regards to Consumer Products, the reported results were about over [100 million] better than what consensus was looking for. I wonder if you could just maybe give a little color as to where that upside came from? Was this a pull forward for maybe 2Q or another quarter? Or was -- are you just seeing more positive retail orders?Christian CocksNo. I think we're seeing some underlying momentum in the business across the board. Certainly, Wizards of the Coast came in ahead of expectations. Our latest release based on Phyrexia did very, very well. And we continue to be bullish on what Wizards has in store, particularly The Lord of the Rings set in late Q2. On Consumer Products, I think our POS came in a bit better than planned. It's still not where we want it to be, but I think we're making steady progress. And just to give some perspective on it, based on our own internal numbers, and this doesn't include kind of discounting, we were down about 12% in Q4. We cut that roughly in half in Q1. We were down about 7% year-over-year. And when you take out some of our exited businesses, particularly Disney Princess and Frozen, we were down less than 4% which, by our math, is likely at or ahead of market. We're not satisfied with that, but that was ahead of what we planned. But I think it augurs well for what's going to happen in Q2, Q3 and Q4, where we add like our disciplined execution that we've been doing with our retailers. We add new products, and we add, what we think, is a pretty killer content slate from both ourselves with Transformers and our partners, particularly at Disney.Eric Owen HandlerOkay. That's helpful. And then as a follow-up, can we talk a little bit about Dungeon &amp; Dragons? You've now had a global launch of the movie. A lot of international markets haven't really been exposed to D&amp;D before. Can you maybe talk about your marketing strategy here to bring the game to more markets and how that's going to play out?Christian CocksYes. I mean we're very enthused by the critical response and the fan response to the movie. It is by far the best reviewed movie in Hasbro's history. And so we think it's going to have a very long life, and it's going to perform particularly well in post theatrical sales and streaming. And that's important for us because D&amp;D is a very strong brand in North America. It's well known in Europe and Asia, but not highly engaged or highly penetrated in those markets. And so like a great reviewed movie that has a lot of fan enthusiasm is a perfect opportunity and a perfect entry point into the brand. And then I think the way that we'll expand upon that over time is we're lowering the barriers to entry for the core game by initiatives that we have digitally, particularly the investments we're making in Dungeons &amp; Dragons and Beyond, and kind of what we call a virtual tabletop, which is kind of like a video game like experience for being able to play the game. And then we have a very aggressive lineup of new digital content and video games coming out, starting with Baldur's Gate 3 this year, but then continuing on with other licenses that we haven't yet announced as well as owned content that we have in production at Wizard Studios.And so I think really that kind of one-two punch of have entertainment, which makes the brand broadly accessible. And then add on to that low barrier entry digital experiences is really going to be kind of the flywheel that drives the brand's growth over the next couple of years.OperatorOur next question is from Drew Crum with Stifel.Andrew Edward CrumDeb, best of luck. It was a real pleasure working with you over the years. So maybe to start, part of your original outlook, you had flagged $300 million of sales headwinds from outsourcing brands and foreign exchange. Is there an updated figure you can share there? How is the business tracking to that $300 million? And then I have a follow-up.Christian CocksYes. So in Q1, we predicted that about $75 million of that $300 million would manifest, and that's the case. We're not operating in Russia. We're not doing Disney Princess or Trolls or Sesame Street, and we are starting to out-license some of our secondary properties. We anticipate about 60% or so of that $300 million will manifest in the first half of the year. And really, what we're seeing is, I think, better-than-anticipated strength in our overall gaming portfolio, particularly MAGIC and D&amp;D. And then we're starting to see some impact around improved execution at retail, and across our marketing teams, particularly in our franchise brands that saw some decent POS across Transformers. We see some momentum in core NERF, we see momentum in core Hasbro Gaming, PEPPA PIG and PLAY-DOH as well.Andrew Edward CrumGot it. And then maybe just my follow-up. Your forecast for the Wizards segment to achieve high 30s EBIT margin in '23, a little bit lower relative to the last few years. Is that a reasonable range over the longer term? Or would you anticipate margin expansion beyond '23, which feels like more of an investment year?Christian CocksI would say high 30s is what we're targeting in the midterm, for sure. We're investing pretty significantly in building out our digital capacity. Some of that is capitalized, but not all of it. And so I think as we start to launch those games, you'll start to see kind of like the realization of those capitalized costs, which will impact kind of like the midterm outlook for our margins. And then as we expand Magic in particular with things like Universes Beyond, it's a great opportunity to bring in new players, but that's going to be a little bit of a margin impact, both in terms of the royalties that we spend as well as the development costs because those tend to be a little bit more intensive when you involve a second party. Now that said, we feel like that's a really wise investment. When we attract a new Magic player, they typically stick around for 5 to 7 years and they have an average revenue per user over that time in the $500 to $1,000 range. So giving up a little bit of margin upfront to attract a highly engaged, highly profitable fan segment, we think it's a nice trade-off that helps us and helps our shareholders win over the long term.OperatorOur next question is from Jason Haas with Bank of America.Jason Daniel HaasI'd also like to say congratulations to Deb as well on your retirement, and best of luck on your future endeavors. In terms of my questions, I was curious for Consumer Products. Are you expecting POS improvement through the remainder of the year to get to down mid-single-digit guidance? And can you just talk about what the drivers are in the rest of the year?Christian CocksYes. So in terms of POS, I think Q1 was really about execution. It was about nuts and bolts working with our retailers, improving our positioning, improving our inventory outlook. Through the end of Q1, our retail inventory is down about 15%, which we think is a good down payment on the year. And we'll continue to make steady progress in that in Q2 and Q3. Our owned inventory is up a bit, but most of that has to do with kind of the nature of Wizards production and load-in for our entertainment releases around Action figures. Outside of Wizards and Action figures, our owned inventory is actually down through Q1 as well. When we get into Q2 and Q3, I think we'll add to that kind of disciplined execution with increased marketing support and content support with a host of blockbuster movies and great streaming content, whether it's from us or from Disney. And then also, we're just going to have a lot more product innovation. Q1, we had a couple of new things that hit pretty well. Our Gel segment is doing pretty well inside of NERF. NERF Jr. launched, and that's doing pretty well to expand age segments inside of the NERF portfolio. But really, it's Q2 and Q3, where all of our new games, a lot of our preschool innovation. I'm particularly excited for Young Jedi Adventures with our partnership with Star Wars in preschool and what we can do there. As well as across the board, several new pieces of innovation that we haven't announced yet, but we see a lot of retailer excitement for, that should add to the POS momentum.Jason Daniel HaasThat's great. And then can you just walk through the releases for Magic for 2Q versus 2Q last year? Because I thought it was -- I know you've said you're expecting to be down, I know that was the initial expectation for 2Q. But I just think we have loaded the range, which seems to be off to a good start. And then what's that up against? Was that Kamigawa last year? Can you just kind of help frame up what causes the difficult compare?Christian CocksWell, Kamigawa was Q1 of last year. Double Masters was in, I believe, second quarter last year. Really, it's less around the sell-through of the releases because we actually think the sell-through is going to be quite strong in Q2, and it's the timing of the releases, particularly in the beginning of the quarter and then in Q3. So like our March of the Machines release this year comes a little bit earlier than last year's comparable release. So we had a little bit of Q1 shipped, which affects Q2. And then our major release for Q3 is about a month later year-over-year. So last year, we were able to ship a fair bit of our Q3 release at the end of Q2. Whereas this year, almost all of that Q3 release will be shipped solely in Q3. So while we're excited about the sell-through and the fan engagement potential of the Q2 releases, we actually for the quarter in terms of a sell-in perspective, are down about 1 set to 1.5 set year-over-year.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question is from Fred Wightman with Wolfe Research.Frederick Charles WightmanI just wanted to follow up on the retail inventory performance. It sounded like in the prepared remarks, you expected that to be sort of cleaned up by the end of the first half. And then Chris, I thought you just made a comment that it could continue into 3Q. So when do you sort of think that will be normalized? And is it a little bit sooner than you would have thought exiting last quarter?Christian CocksWell, I would say we'll get to pretty normal levels by the end of Q2, but there will be some additional kind of cleanup into Q3. That's just the nature of the beast. In terms of our owned inventories, we made progress outside of action figures and Wizards in Q1, and we expect that to continue. I would say we'll be done with about 50% to 60% of the job by the end of Q2, and should be pretty clean on kind of our aged inventory by the end of Q3 and entering Q4 in a pretty clean state, both for retailers as well as our owned and operated. Our goal for the year continues to be our overall inventories are down 25% or more with comparable levels exiting 2023 to what we exited 2021 at, which was a historically low year for us.Frederick Charles WightmanMakes sense. So if we think about the timing that you just touched on for the retail inventories and we think about sort of the year-over-year changes in some of the Magic releases, can you just help us think about the mix for the back half of the year as far as 3Q versus 4Q, like how do you sort of see that shaking out versus historical patterns? And how do you sort of see the back half of the year progressing versus that first half guide that you gave us?Christian CocksDeb, do you want to take the follow-up?Deborah M. ThomasSure. So historically, the back half of the year has always been like in the high 60% range, and we expect it to get back to that this year. As far as the mix, as we talked about, we expect Q3 to be the biggest quarter for Magic this year. We've got very strong releases. Chris talked about the timing. And you'll certainly see more sell-through. We shipped Lord of the Rings late in Q2 but the sell-through comes in Q3. So when you think about the mix, we do expect the consumer to come back. We talked about that. It's just a function of the timing. But we do expect a bigger quarter for Magic, just looking at timing and releases. But overall, we expect it to get back to that normalized rate in the back half of the year.OperatorWe have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Debbie for closing comments.Debbie HancockThank you, Sherry. And thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. The replay will be available on our website in approximately 2 hours, and management's prepared remarks will be posted on our website following this call.I'd also like to let you know that Hasbro management will be participating in the Wolfe Research Leisure Conference on May 11 and 12; and the JPMorgan TMT Conference on May 22.

But the Street is actually looking past that in this latest earnings report, with shares moving to the upside. It's one of the top performers in the S&amp;P today. And here's what is giving investors confidence: growth in digital gaming. Sales from its ""Wizards of the Coast"" in the digital gaming division jumping 12%. That partially offset the 23% decline that Hasbro did report in consumer products. Another key part of this report was that the Street actually liked the guidance there. Despite a drop in sales, Hasbro very confident, maintaining its full-year revenue and operating margins. So they are expecting improvement in the second half of the year. Hopefully, consumers keep spending.- I know, right? I mean, I have to admit I saw some of the data on Hasbro and I was surprised that it was in digital. I didn't even know they were in digital, in the digital space. But clearly they got to ramp up there, because they're competing with Roblox. And that's where the eyeballs are. I mean, you guys know I have a small kid, 7, and he's already getting away from the toys, the tactile toys. He likes sports, but he prefers digital when it comes to things to play with outside of sports.- Hasbro not alone in a solid beat, because Mattel reported today and they're up almost 7%. They both had inventory issues. But there's more overlap. They're also working together. Hasbro and Mattel, a couple of days ago announcing collaboration, which you don't really see in any other industry. Imagine United and American, or whether it's Coke and Pepsi. So they're going to have collaborations like Barbie Monopoly, like Transformers Uno in a very interesting partnership. Some feel that there is a merger down the road, but just whispers at this point.]"

FerrisThank you, George, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. I'm pleased to report that FIS is off to a very strong start in 2023. Our financial results exceeded our expectations on all key metrics: revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Organic revenue growth outperformed across all 3 of our operating segments. This outperformance was driven by a combination of both stronger execution, as well as better-than-anticipated macroeconomic impacts, including consumer spending and higher levels of deposit account and transaction growth across the financial services sector. Heritage FIS, which includes our banking and capital markets businesses, posted strong recurring revenue growth of 6%. Merchant revenue grew 2% driven by 15% organic growth in our e-commerce business, well ahead of the broader market. We remain focused on improving cash flow and efficiency across the company and are on track to delivering on our greater than 80% free cash flow conversion target for the year. These are very strong results against our expectations and can be attributed to our leadership team and our colleagues across the globe, all pulling together to build our future forward. I'm extremely proud of the team, and I'm very excited about and confident in the future of FIS. As a result of our strong performance, I am pleased to announce we are raising our full year outlook. First quarter results meaningfully exceeded our expectations, reflecting stronger revenue growth of 3% across the enterprise. Solid execution and a more favorable macro environment fueled this outperformance. Banking and Capital Markets recurring revenue growth of 6% exceeded our expectations, benefiting from elevated financial services activity, including higher levels of deposit account and transaction growth. Within the Merchant segment, improved execution and stronger consumer spend drove most of the revenue upside. E-commerce had another very strong quarter with 18% organic growth, excluding the Russia-Ukraine impact in the quarter, contributing an additional point of merchant revenue growth relative to our internal expectations. We are updating our second quarter and full year guidance to reflect consistent trends from the first quarter to the second quarter, with a very slight moderation in the high levels of trading volume experienced in Q1. Our outlook for the full year has strengthened relative to the outlook we provided in February across all of our operating segments. Given our overall strong results and improving operating performance, we are increasing our full year 2023 outlook, while continuing to account for risk associated with macroeconomic impacts to our Merchant segment in the back half of the year. We understand the importance of delivering on our commitments and are confident in our recently raised outlook. We continue moving forward with a high sense of urgency and are making progress across our range of initiatives. The spin-off of Worldpay is on track. We are making meaningful progress both internally with the formation of our separation management office and externally with our regulators. Our future forward initiatives, designed to drive greater efficiency, effectiveness and growth, is off to an exceptional start. I'm confident we will not only deliver on our 2023 cash savings target of $500 million, but achieve at least our $1.25 billion of cash savings target by year-end 2024. On the governance front, we've taken broad steps forward to align all management compensation with operating share price performance. These changes were made in order to further align our executive compensation programs with long-term shareholder interest. We've also reorientated our sales force compensation plans to align to our stated goal of pursuing high-quality, higher-margin deals. We are driving a performance-based culture both tops down and bottoms up across the globe. We are making good progress preparing for the planned spin-off of the Worldpay business. This is a testament to the hard work, focus and dedication of our FIS colleagues and business partners tasked with marshalling forward the separation quickly. We are making meaningful progress having created a separation management office to work with both Charles Drucker and me. In addition to working towards securing required regulatory approvals, we are urgently negotiating commercial revenue and separation agreements across the 2 companies with an eye towards minimizing business disruption and dissynergy. While we are not yet ready to provide formal dissynergy estimates on this call, we are actively working to minimize the impact of any dissynergies. I'd like to offer a framework for thinking through the potential impact, which we believe will be very manageable. Previously, the company disclosed that it achieved a total of $750 million in revenue synergies and $500 million of operating expense synergies post the Worldpay acquisition. We expect to maintain the majority of the $750 million revenue synergy achievement with Worldpay continuing to act as an important distribution partner for FIS post spin. We also expect to maintain a meaningful portion of FIS Worldpay operating expense integration savings. Additionally, my partnership with Charles Drucker is already bringing focus to the business and is driving meaningful results in key areas, such as sales execution, and maximizing pricing opportunities across all of FIS. As I mentioned earlier, our Enterprise Transformation Program, Future Forward is off to a great start. We are confident not only achieving our targeted $500 million of cash savings in 2023, but have direct line of sight into executing on the additional $750 million of cash savings expected in 2024, while investing in improved client service and next-generation product development for our clients. As of first quarter of 2023, we've achieved a total cash savings on an annual run rate basis in excess of $210 million. We expect operating expense savings to accelerate over the course of the year. While we are reiterating our Future Forward cash savings target of at least $1.2 billion -- $1.25 billion by year-end 2024, the team is continuing to identify additional opportunities across the enterprise to unlock growth, efficiency and effectiveness for FIS and our clients. While we are confident the program will deliver meaningful cash savings for FIS, this will not come at the expense of clients who remain at the center of our decision-making. We believe our solid first quarter recurring revenue growth underscores the importance of our customers' place on our offerings and services and our commitment to their own future. Given recent events across the global banking sector, we want to provide you with an update regarding trends across our Banking segment. While recent developments have driven volatility in markets and across the banking sector, we do not expect this activity to impact us significantly in the near term, and believe FIS is well positioned to be a beneficiary of the recent disruption in the long term. Our confidence is underpinned both by current factors we are presently seeing in our business and historical precedent, which points to resilient bank IT spend following periods of financial duress. A recent study by Curinos, a leading provider of data, technology and insights to financial institutions noted: Recent events should have a limited impact on near-term revenue for core processors as the current situation is impacting deposit balances, not accounts. Additionally, technology processing spend across the banking industry has also historically been resilient during prior challenging cycles of uncertainty. In line with Curinos' perspective, since the onset of the SVB fallout in early March, we have seen elevated increases in our accounts on file serviced across our core platforms, which is the primary driver of our banking revenue. The resilience and accounts on file is not surprising to us. It aligns with what the banking industry experienced during prior challenging periods as the Curinos study noted, and supports our confidence in our outlook for the Banking segment. As depositors disperse funds across multiple bank accounts, ultimately driving more account growth, FIS is well positioned to benefit as a leading provider of core banking technology, particularly to large financial institutions, which is the primary base of our FI business. Additionally, to the extent the recent turbulence results in increased regulation, FIS is well positioned to benefit across both the Banking and Capital Markets segments. FIS boasts a highly diversified customer base with no one client accounting for more than 1% of company revenue. Given our SKU towards somewhat larger banks, consolidation across the FI space should benefit us as we would expect these larger banks, many of which are FIS customers, to be the buyers of distressed financial institutions, and this is exactly what we've seen play out thus far with respect to recently sold failed financial banks. Additionally, 60% of our revenue growth is predominantly tied to accounts and 40% to transactions. Since the SVB announcement, we've seen a modest acceleration in accounts on file and transaction volumes remain steady. Given these dynamics, we do not anticipate a significant impact to our business associated with the recent events. Before turning it over to Erik, I'd like to close with a quick refresh of the new agenda we introduced just a few short months ago and the significant progress we are making executing against those goals. As you can see, we are moving urgently to put FIS on a path for sustained value creation for all stakeholders. The macroeconomic conditions, whether consumer or financial services related, have positively impacted our results in the first quarter and regardless of whether they remain or decline from this point forward, we are confident enough to raise our outlook for the year. The planned spin-off of Worldpay is on track, creating 2 world-class companies with a sharpened focus on their respective client bases. Our Future Forward initiative is progressing ahead of schedule, accelerating the transformation of FIS into a more agile and efficient company better positioned to drive innovation. And lastly, we're focused on returning Heritage FIS back to the compounder model of the past with a focus on steady revenue growth, margin expansion, improved free cash flow generation and a sustainable double-digit total shareholder return. With that, let me turn it over to Erik, who will take you through the financials. Erik?Erik D. HoagThanks, Stephanie, and thank you all for joining us this morning. I'll begin on Slide 14 with some additional detail on our financial results before moving into our increased guidance, future forward achievement and capital allocation priorities for Heritage FIS. Our first quarter results exceeded our expectations across all financial metrics. Revenue increased 3% organically to $3.5 billion, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 38.7% and adjusted EPS of $1.29. Revenue growth came in 2 points above the high end of our outlook. As Stephanie mentioned, this outperformance was driven by a combination of both stronger operating performance, as well as better-than-anticipated macroeconomic impacts, including consumer spending and higher levels of deposit account and transaction growth across the financial services sector. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS exceeded expectations through both operational strength and the benefit in net interest expense. Moving to cash flow on our balance sheet. Capital expenditures decreased 32% year-over-year to $279 million or 8% of revenue, reflecting the benefits of our Future Forward initiatives. We generated free cash flow of $641 million or 84% conversion, and returned over $300 million to our shareholders through dividends. Lastly, we exited the quarter with $20 billion in total debt, yielding a leverage ratio of 3.2x at a weighted average interest rate of 3%. Turning to our Heritage FIS results on Slide 15. We're pleased to report organic revenue growth of 4%, driven by 6% recurring revenue growth. Our backlog continues to be strong and durable, exiting the quarter at $22.5 billion. As previously mentioned, our sales teams are transitioning to target higher quality, more profitable new sales which will drive sustainable high-margin growth. Because of this, we would anticipate some softness in backlog over the short term as the team aligns to these initiatives. This change in sales initiatives is fully incorporated into the increased outlook for the year. Ultimately, the result of this will be higher quality new sales, laying the foundation for sustainable growth in revenue, EBITDA and cash flow, while providing best-in-class capabilities for our clients, as well as emphasizing our high-margin, sticky recurring revenue offerings. Overall, this is a very strong start to the year for Heritage FIS segments as we saw stronger-than-anticipated operating performance, driving results above our expectations. At the segment level, Banking increased 2% organically in the quarter, which was 2 points above the high end of our outlook. This outlook was underpinned by recurring revenue growth of 4%, which exceeds our -- which exceeded our expectations. Strength in recurring revenue was driven by strong execution from our business in conjunction with elevated account and transaction growth during the quarter. As expected, adjusted EBITDA margins contracted 250 basis points to 40.1%, primarily driven by a 23% reduction in termination fees and onetime license revenue. This performance in margin improved compared to our fourth quarter results, and we continue to anticipate sequential margin improvement through 2023, leading to expansion in the back half of the year. For the second quarter, we are anticipating banking organic revenue growth of 0% to 2%, which incorporates a continued reduction in nonrecurring revenue, and we remain confident in meeting or exceeding our organic growth outlook for the year. Turning to our capital markets results and outlook on Slide 17. Capital markets increased 7% organically in the quarter, exceeding the high end of our outlook by 2 points. The overperformance in the quarter was underpinned by 11% recurring revenue growth, with a 4-point tailwind associated with elevated activity in the financial services industry. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 30 basis points to 48.2%. Margin expansion in the quarter was driven by high contribution margins on our revenue growth as well as the underlying strength of the one-to-many operating model. We continue to see resilient strength in the operating performance of Capital Markets, and believe our multiyear transition to SaaS-based engagements has laid the foundation for resilient growth. For the second quarter, we anticipate organic revenue growth of 4% to 6%, primarily associated with an assumption of recurring revenue normalizing off the elevated growth seen in the first quarter. For the year, we're reiterating our outlook of 4% to 6%, inclusive of a tough license compare in the fourth quarter. Turning to Slide 18. Our Merchant segment increased 2% organically, exceeding the high end of our outlook by 2 points as we saw better-than-expected consumer spending and accelerated growth in e-commerce. Broadly speaking, we're seeing continued strength in our e-commerce subsegment, accelerating to 15% in the quarter with strong sales and exceptional growth in our Worldplay for Platforms offering. Worldplay for Platforms continues to benefit from our ongoing investments and renewed leadership structure, and we continue to see a significant opportunity in this attractive vertical. Our SMB and enterprise subsegments saw trends similar to our fourth quarter 2022 results. Consistent with our guide, margins contracted 350 basis points to 43.5%, primarily due to unfavorable revenue mix. Global volume increased 9% on a constant currency basis to $551 billion. This acceleration was a result of stronger consumer spend across our enterprise and e-commerce subsegments. In the quarter, volume growth outpaced revenue growth as a result of higher spend in nondiscretionary verticals, for example, grocery and drugstore, and market share gains within the PayFac vertical.Turning to Slide 19 for a further review of Heritage Worldpay's outlook for the year. As we entered the year, we had anticipated organic revenue decline of 2% to 4%. The guide reflected a 300 basis point headwind associated with attrition in the SMB subsegment, and further macro deterioration impacting growth by an additional 500 basis points. Our first quarter results outperformed our expectations by 2 points compared to the high end of our outlook. While the business continues to be impacted by the headwinds in the SMB subsegment, consumer spending performed better than expected in the U.S. and the U.K. As a result, we're updating our second quarter and full year guidance to reflect relatively consistent trends from the first quarter to the second quarter, and improved consumer spend in the back half of the year. Because of this, we now anticipate second quarter organic revenue growth of negative 1% to plus 1%, and full year organic revenue growth of down to 1%, a material improvement compared to initial expectations. This outlook for the second quarter assumes relatively similar trends across our subsegments compared to the first quarter. On the margin front, we will continue to see improvements through the year consistent with normal seasonality and further aided by our Future Forward initiatives. Turning to Slide 20 for a review of our increased 2023 guidance. Given our strong start to the year, we're confidently increasing our full year 2023 outlook to incorporate the overperformance seen in the first quarter. Specifically, we're increasing our revenue and EBITDA ranges by $85 million and $35 million, respectively, accounting for a $0.06 increase in our adjusted earnings per share outlook for the year. This increase is aligned directly to our first quarter results compared to the high end of our prior guide. Our increased outlook over the remainder of the year has strengthened relative to the outlook we provided in February, based on the current trends in our businesses. With that in mind, for the year, we now anticipate consolidated organic revenue growth of 0% to 1%, adjusted EBITDA margins of 41.5% to 42.2% and adjusted earnings per share of $5.76 to $6.06. As I stated in our last earnings call, our philosophy continues to remain conservative in our forward projections as we continue to build credibility and deliver on our commitments. This increased outlook continues to account for risk associated with macroeconomic impact in our Merchant segment, and we would anticipate further upside if macro trends remain stable. As previously mentioned, we continue to anticipate margin improvement over the course of 2023 as we ramp the benefits associated with Future Forward, and we're reiterating our outlook for free cash flow conversion of over 80%. Lastly, we provided additional assumptions on our -- for our guidance in the appendix as well as a revised 2022 organic base to account for some small shifts in our operating segment rollouts. Turning to Slide 21 for a financial update on Future Forward. We remain committed to rightsizing our expense base while ensuring minimal impact to our clients or colleagues. Aligned to this commitment, Future Forward centers around investing in sales and support, automating and improving processes and improving the ways we work. As Stephanie mentioned, we're reiterating our targets for operational expense savings of $300 million exiting 2023 and $600 million exiting 2024. We had a strong start to the year with annual run rate savings of over $100 million exiting the quarter, with an in-quarter benefit of over $15 million. We continue to target a $200 million reduction in capital expenditures during 2023, with an incremental $100 million reduction in 2024. In the quarter, we achieved annualized CapEx savings of over $110 million as we executed rapidly on the Future Forward initiative. We're extremely pleased with our early progress, and we'll continue to provide quarterly updates on achievement throughout the program. I'll conclude with a recap of our capital allocation priorities for Heritage FIS on Slide 22. Following the successful execution of the spin, Heritage FIS will remain focused on reducing debt, increasing our dividend and utilizing excess capital for share repurchase or tuck-in M&amp;A. First, we continue to target a long-term leverage ratio of approximately 2.8x. To achieve this, we would anticipate reducing total debt, while also benefiting from adjusted EBITDA growth over a multiyear period. Next, we remain committed to a 35% dividend payout ratio for Heritage FIS. Following these 2 pillars, we will utilize excess cash or debt capacity for share repurchase or optionality around tuck-in M&amp;A opportunities. Our default use of excess capital will prioritize share repurchase at current valuations while we assess M&amp;A opportunities in their risk-adjusted returns. This capital allocation strategy is conservative in nature, while providing a robust value proposition for long-term shareholder value over a multiyear period. I'd like to thank everyone for their time this morning. Operator, would you please open the line for questions?Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And today's first question will come from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.Tien-Tsin HuangGreat. I appreciate all the disclosure here and the good results. I wanted to dive in on the banking side, which is really good to see. And just maybe Stephanie and Erik, just check your confidence in maintaining the 0% to 2% outlook here on banking. Because when I think about the inputs, I think about backlog conversion, attrition, pricing, and you commented on the underlying recurring revenue growth through deposits. So is the formula different now than maybe what we saw with the banking turmoil and SVB, et cetera? Any thoughts there?Stephanie L. FerrisYes. Thanks, Tien-Tsin. Yes, so happy with the output for first quarter. Very confident in our guide for banking. I think what you've seen is, as we came into this year, we had expected backlog growth to mute. That was in our guide and we're not seeing any incremental impact from anything going on in the banking business. What we're seeing is organic growth, and you saw it come through in the first quarter as we benefit from accounts across the financial services landscape increasing broadly across our portfolio. So we're seeing net new deposit accounts and, broadly, net new financial services accounts across our entire portfolio. So we feel really good about the organic growth. You can see it there in our first quarter, and we feel really good about the guide.Tien-Tsin HuangGreat. I appreciate all that. Side 11 is really useful. But just on the Merchant front with -- Erik, I think you talked about the spread there. Can you just maybe give a little bit more on what's driving that mix versus pricing? I know you mentioned the PayFac piece, but a little bit more would be great.Stephanie L. FerrisYes. Tien-Tsin, I'll take that, and Erik can add on if he'd like to. So look, we were really pleased with the volume growth. So just kind of starting at the top, we saw really strong volume growth, that was driven by both our enterprise book which performed a little bit better than we expected from a volume standpoint and really strong e-commerce activity in the first quarter. So as you come into the yield dynamic, there's really 2 pieces coming into impact to the yield. The first is our nondiscretionary, so think -- in our enterprise book, things like Kroger,and drug store or grocery and drug, those became a higher mix. And as you know, those are priced on transactions, not on volume. And so those drove a little bit of a lower yield off the higher volume. And then the second thing is we continue to take pretty significant market share gains in our PayFac business, which is very strategic for us, which, as you know, is a lower-yielding, higher-volume piece of our business. So those 2 really drove the yield impact in the fourth quarter. We do expect to see sequential yield improvement each quarter throughout the rest of the year as we continue to perform positively, and the mix resets itself. But those are the 2 big reasons.OperatorOne moment for our next questions. And that will come from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.James Eugene FaucetteWanted to talk a little bit just about your expectations for the macro environment generally. Obviously, the first quarter came in a little bit stronger with better economic resilience than you anticipated in your original outlook. If we look at the magnitude of beat versus the guidance raise, it seems like that we're not increasing the guidance quite as much as the beat this quarter. Have you just anticipated that some of that weakness that you originally built in kind of pushed out? Or can you just talk through the assumptions that leads you to that kind of current guidance outlook?Erik D. HoagSure. Maybe I'll start with -- so when we provided guidance a quarter ago, we provided 500 basis points of presumed headwind in the guide associated with Merchant macro. The full year guide at the time was minus 2% to minus 4%, we have increased the merchant guide from -- to minus 1%, minus 2%. The midpoint of the guide has improved by 150 basis points. I would think about the remaining residual Merchant macro headwind at roughly 350 basis points.James Eugene FaucetteGot it. Got it. And then as far as the work being done for the eventual split, et cetera. I know that you're kind of working through that. What's your sense in terms of if we -- if there are any incremental changes that may be needed in interest expense? And how should we think about the timing of when we'll be able to start to look at what capital structure will look like? I think you've been very clear of what -- particularly you want the Heritage FIS overall view to be, but just wondering how we should think about the timing and other factors that need to be taken into account besides these dissynergies?Stephanie L. FerrisYes. So James, we are diligently working. Hopefully, everyone can see we're working at pace to try and get all of that down. Don't have a good update for you right now as you might expect as we work through it. And Charles is in here working with us very tightly in terms of thinking through all those pieces. I think as we get closer to the spin, we'll have a view of that. I can't really make a commitment in terms of next quarter, but you should know that we're working really tightly towards it. But until we have a really -- a much stronger view, can't really give you much of a guide there yet.OperatorOne moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Dave Koning with Baird.David John KoningGreat job.Stephanie L. FerrisThank you.David John KoningYes, yes. I guess my first question, Capital Markets, you mentioned something about some elevated -- or elevated activity creating kind of a 4% tailwind in the quarter. What was that? And is that somewhat of a less recurring part that falls off a little in Q2?Stephanie L. FerrisYes. Thanks for asking that question. So lots of trading volume, right, across all of our banking cores as well as across our capital markets business. We saw trading volume at a peak that we haven't seen since COVID. So that business and the leader of that business did a fantastic job supporting all of that volume growth. And that's what drove a couple of percentage points of the beat in recurring revenue that we had posted. So as we come into the second quarter, we're slightly moderating that growth back down as we're starting to see people moderate in terms of transaction volume across those portfolios, but it's still pretty elevated.David John KoningGot you. And maybe just a follow-up question. In Merchant, I think the first half, the way you're guiding is a little better than the back half. But I think to Tien-Tsin's question, you said the yield impact gets a little better through the course of the year. So does that mean volume decelerates a little bit through the year?Stephanie L. FerrisI think that's a fair assumption as you think about it. Yes, we would think 9% volume in the first quarter was really strong. As we think about it coming into the back half of the year, we think about a bit of moderation just on a conservative guide.OperatorOne moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Rayna Kumar with UBS.Rayna KumarI just want to ask about FedNow since it's going to be released in July. What will FIS's role be with that release? And do you view it as an opportunity here?Stephanie L. FerrisYes. Thanks for the question. We're in very tight partnership with the Fed. We're in the process of enabling our financial institutions to roll out FedNow across our entire client base. So we'll continue to play a major role in the adoption of the FedNow rails. For us, it's another payment medium coming to the market, which is what we specialize in, in terms of thinking about all the payment methods we enable globally across our distribution channels. We're pretty excited about the enablement of that on behalf of our financial institutions. It's definitely an opportunity for FIS, but it's a little bit too early for us to see the size of the opportunity. But we were enabled and ready. And as financial institutions adopt it, we're ready to help them put it -- make it become live.Rayna KumarGot it. That's helpful. And then I just want to ask about Payrix. You've owned that for a year now. Can you talk about the progress of the acquisition and how it's altering your go-to-market strategy in the SMB space?Stephanie L. FerrisYes. So our Payrix acquisition is hitting on all cylinders. You can see it's a big part of the e-commerce growth story that we're seeing. As you know, that -- we brought that capability in-house, which really helped solidify our Worldpay per platform's offering out to those software platforms that want to either integrate payments, embed payments or become a PayFac. So we have a full suite of offering now offered out the Worldplay for Platforms offering. It is growing significantly. The volume is growing significantly. We couldn't be more pleased with the success of it.OperatorOne moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson.Lisa Ann Dejong EllisTerrific. Stephanie, I was hoping maybe you could comment a little bit on initiatives you have underway on the talent side as you're going through the transformation at FIS. Just thinking about things like are you bringing in some external talent, what are you doing around sort of retaining and making sure morale is improved or maintained throughout this period?Stephanie L. FerrisThanks for the question, Lisa. Yes. So look, I stand on an amazing culture and talent here as I come into FIS. It's one of the reasons I came back to FIS and rejoining such a talented leadership team. But as you might expect, there's some folks here who have wanted to move into retirement, as Erik took on Woody's role as he moved into retirement. So we are changing out the leadership team as those folks want to move on.I think we're really excited about -- we just recently brought on a new Chief Technology Officer. We brought on a new President of Platforms and Enterprise products. So really looking at focusing on the product and technology and making sure that we can continue to deliver our best-in-class products and services out to our clients. Martin Boyd retired last year, we brought on a new Head of Banking Solutions. So really focusing on balancing the great talent that's here and bringing in some really impressive new, talent and bringing them together as a team to work on -- bringing FIS Future Forward.Lisa Ann Dejong EllisGreat. And then this one maybe -- could be (inaudible), I guess. But just a follow-up on Banking Solutions, can you just remind us the mix within Banking Solutions of recurring versus nonrecurring professional services, sort of how you think about that segmentation and then maybe elaborate a little bit on the comments around pivoting the sales team to focusing on more kind of higher quality recurring revenues, kind of what's that change?Erik D. HoagLisa, it's Erik. Thanks for the question. In the first quarter, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we saw a significant decline in nonrecurring revenue in banking, e.g., we're seeing an increase in recurring revenue. So the split between recurring and nonrecurring was roughly 18:14 in the first quarter. And then from a sales perspective, Stephanie, do you want to...Stephanie L. FerrisYes. So as I started -- as I mentioned in the fourth quarter, we hired a chief -- new Chief Revenue Officer and we started pivoting the sales team to focus on higher margin, higher profitability products. We have an amazing set of products at FIS, really spans the gamut in terms of everything that a financial services company would need, a payments company would need. And we've done a great job on sales. You can see that from our backlog. But as we come into 2023 and beyond, and we really focused on delivering below the line, margin expansion, et cetera, we've repivoted them back to driving sales into the higher-margin products, trying to get our margins back in line with expectations. And so as we did that, you're going to see our backlog start to flatten. That was our expectation. We would expect to see that happen in the short term here. That was all baked into our original outlook, it's baked into our current outlook and the transition is going well.OperatorOne moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.Jason Alan KupferbergI wanted to actually maybe pick up right there where you left off, Stephanie, just on banking and the backlog. Understanding it will take some time to fully implement this updated go-to-market strategy, when do you think backlog growth starts to resume? And then what are the implications of the newer go-to-market strategy for your medium-term outlook on banking?Stephanie L. FerrisYes. Great question, Jason. So I think backlog expectations are going to remain muted for the rest of the year as we reposition the pipeline and put the higher-margin products ahead of the lower-margin products. So on a short-term basis, I would expect it to be muted. I think as we come into 2024, though, I feel really good about where we're going to end up in terms of new sales. And then we're also really focused on the other levers. So if you think about focusing on attrition compression, pricing and new sales as well as the positive organic we're seeing again in the business, we feel really good as we come into 2024 and 2025, that some of those levers we can pull on and bring us back to growth. And then if you remember, a lot of the reason, in 2023, our growth was muted in the Banking Solutions businesses because we're growing over a lot of termination and nonrecurring fees. And we're really focusing the sales force on driving recurring revenue. And so as we just lapped that in 2024, that will drive a couple of percentage points of growth for us.Erik D. HoagYes. And Jason, maybe just to add on to that for a moment. If you look at our first quarter results for recurring revenue in Banking Solutions, we did have 2% organic, but we did have 4% recurring revenue growth in the quarter. A little bit of a proof point in the -- through the lens of the normalized 3% to 5% growth range that we talked about a quarter ago.Jason Alan KupferbergHelpful. Yes. That's great. Great data points. Maybe just switching gears to merchant for a second. What would you say is really driving the higher outlook for the year? I mean, which segment, is it more on the enterprise side, the SMB, the e-com? Is it is a little bit of all of the above? And just anything you might be able to share with respect to what you've seen in April in Merchant volume and transaction trends?Stephanie L. FerrisYes. I think generally, consumer spend across all of our segments and then better operating performance. It's really across all 3. But we're very, very bullish on our e-commerce business. We continue to drive all of our investments in there. Payrix is in there. It's going very well. But I would say, it's really across the board. We did see some moderation in recession in U.K. But I'd say, it's generally across the board.OperatorOne moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research.Darrin David PellerWhen we look at the banking and cap markets, effectively, the RemainCo post spin, just remind us, if you don't mind the algorithm on that business you'd expect? I know obviously investment grade, looking at the long-term targets, it would seem to be somewhere in the, call it, 3% to 6% if you look across banking and cap markets. Are you -- strategically speaking, in terms of banking first, are you still thinking about more of the singles and doubles? And are you incorporating a large bank in that or a large win into that guide yet? But more importantly, long term, can you just remind us on the bridge from where we're growing now to get back to that level?Stephanie L. FerrisYes. I think we laid this out in our fourth quarter call. So happy to reiterate that. As you think about -- I think we said 3% to 5% plus for Heritage FIS. And as you think about that, Banking should reaccelerate on its own given its organic growth components as we grow over. Two things in 2023 it's impacting. One is the large strategic sales, and we don't have any of those in our 2023 forecast and we wouldn't expect to need them to hit our medium-term 3% to 5% heritage FIS growth.That would be incremental to that. But if you recall, we are, in 2023, growing over a lot of our nonrecurring. And so that is a 1% or 2% point lift as we grow over that in 2024. So we feel really good about the midterm 3% to 5% for Heritage FIS as we benefit from those 2 things.Darrin David PellerOkay. And just as a quick follow-up on the potential for the dis-synergies. I think you had mentioned or you alluded to on the prepared comments that you're doing everything you can to minimize that to almost nothing or no dis-synergies. Obviously, I know that's probably not going to be 0, but it does sound like you're building confidence that it's not going to be that much or maybe as much as some out there would have been saying. Can you give us a little more follow-up? I know we're not prepared for a full -- for an exact number yet.Stephanie L. FerrisYes, happy to. So look, I think what I said is and talking about the revenue synergies, we would expect to retain the majority of those previously achieved. I mean we feel really good about that. Worldpay will continue to be a distribution partner for us, and we're in the process of building out a commercial partnership arrangement with them. So we feel really good about that.On the operating expense side, I think I said that we would look to maintain a meaningful portion of those. And then obviously, we would look to manage anything that's left over. They're not going to be 0. It's just not possible. But we are looking to manage them, and we're working very diligently.OperatorOne moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Vasu Govil with KBW.Vasundhara GovilCongratulations on a strong quarter. I guess, Stephanie, just starting on the banking side maybe, has the nature of your conversations with bank clients changed over the course of the last month given what's gone on in banking? And any insights on what they're thinking in terms of tax spend? And is there a risk that current events will further elongate the new sales cycle?Stephanie L. FerrisYes. Let me start by saying we are seeing no elongation of the sales cycle. The majority of what's happening in the banking side is specific to certain banks. You can see that we're seeing net new accounts across the portfolio as consumers are spreading out their accounts across banks, which is generally net positive for most of the banks. I would say for us, what's really important and continues to solidify our partnership and our importance in the ecosystem, is as banks go through whatever volatility they're dealing with, we're very important to making sure that all those deposit accounts get opened, all those money market accounts get opened and that we stand, our systems are very stable and up and running. So we participate hand in glove with our financial institutions no matter what's going on. And I would say through this quarter, I'm just incredibly proud of the team because I could see again how important we are to the financial system ecosystem. And we had a lot of our clients just thank us profusely in terms of whatever their activity was going, whether they had more accounts, whether some of their accounts -- or they need more reporting and our systems remained up and stable, I couldn't thank my team more. So that was a lot of our activity this quarter. What they're thinking, I think, is really consistent with what they've been thinking, which is how do they continue to digitize and modernize the banking platforms. And it's impossible for these financial institutions not to continue to focus on the technology spend they need because, as you know, their consumers are still not coming back in branch. So the need to deliver financial services and products to them digitally omnichannel, et cetera, it's not stopping. In fact, it becomes even more important. So we're not seeing any slowdown in backlog. We're not seeing any slowdown in conversations around needing those products and services that really help them garner more new business. So I'd say the environment remains positive and stable.Vasundhara GovilGreat. And a quick follow-up on the Merchant segment. I sort of got the comment that you were expecting a slight deceleration in volumes in the second quarter. Anything specific you can talk about April relative to the first quarter? And then any big differences you were seeing in the U.S. versus U.K.?Stephanie L. FerrisSure. So April trends are very consistent with March trends. Our first quarter trends were consistent with what everybody else has told you. January and February were elevated as everybody grew over COVID. March moderated slightly, but still very strong. And March and April are pretty consistent. So feel really good coming into the second quarter. But they do modestly decelerate as you think about January and February.U.S., U.K., U.S. consumer continues to be very strong. And I think everybody saw in the first quarter, it was stronger than we expected coming out of the fourth quarter. So not seeing any detail there quite yet. The U.K. is moderating. I would say, it's not starting to improve, but its decline is slightly moderating. So it did slightly better than we expected. It's going to have easier grow-overs as we go throughout the year, and we're anticipating that, that environment gets a little bit more positive. But I wouldn't call that yet in terms of improving.OperatorOne moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets.Daniel Rock PerlinI wanted to ask a question around the Worldpay spin. I mean, we've had a lot of detail on the quarter here. But can you just remind us, Stephanie, when you're thinking about the acquisitions that you really need to target within that space, I would say a couple of things. One is maybe offer up what you're thinking in terms of size of acquisitions that would be required to help, I guess, pick some of the degradation that you see in SMB. And then what do you see in the current environment? Like right now, do you see possible opportunities understanding that this is going to take place late in '23, maybe early '24, but I'm just trying to get a sense of your planning when you start to think about allocating to M&amp;A for that?Stephanie L. FerrisYes. It's a great question, Dan. And as you might expect, Charles and I have been very active in these conversations. So look, I think the great thing about Worldpay is it is a scaled platform with global distribution. And you can see through even our Payrix asset, you can -- if you find the right product and the right distribution channel, put it on the platform and it will drive incremental revenue and incremental margin. So I think it's really exciting in terms of where to go there. I think as we think about the Merchant business growing and getting it back to mid-single and then, he'll, one accelerate to upper single. I think the business he can get back on track in terms of mid-single with higher execution as he comes into '24 and '25. And then I think about acquisitions really delivering a point or 2 percentage points of revenue growth for him. I think there's a lot of opportunities out there. I think we bring a lot of distribution scale to those types of companies. I suspect he'll want to continue to drive the e-commerce business. As we've talked about strategically, we'd like to see that become 50% of the overall revenue of the company. But not quite prepared yet to talk about the who and the what as he starts to strategically evolve that. But I'm -- as you know, I'm pretty bullish about our ability to do M&amp;A in that segment and drive outsized revenue and EBITDA margin growth given the scale and distribution of the platform.Daniel Rock PerlinYes. And we're looking forward to it, too. Just a quick one on banking. With the expectation of all the regulations, maybe getting elevated within the system and maybe in particular on smaller banks, like can you just remind us, maybe specifically, how you guys are positioned to benefit from that? And especially given the asset charge that you gave us in this new slide, obviously you do tilt towards larger financial institutions. So where would you see most of that regulation fall in your opinion?Stephanie L. FerrisYes, happy to. So we absolutely think there'll be more regulation just like everybody else does. We deal with very complex regulation on the capital market side. We have really, really good products that we use over there for financial institutions that are global in nature that are heavily regulated. Those products are very, very applicable as we think about bringing them into the banking solutions side of the house. My President of Banking and President of Capital Markets and I are already in process of bringing those over, starting to educate our larger financial institutions about that product set. We're getting a very high interest rate. And those are things that help people manage liquidity, capital requirements, deposit flows, regulatory requirements, Tier 1 capital ratios. So we have a nice product set that we think we can leverage and bring over, and we think that's pretty differentiated.OperatorOne moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI.David Mark TogutYou called out continued market share gains in the e-com portion of Worldpay, could you talk about what's actually driving the share gains in e-com? Is it within specific verticals? Is it more cross border? Any detail would be appreciated.Stephanie L. FerrisSure. I think it's improved sales execution across e-commerce. As you guys know, we're a global e-commerce shop. We serve a lot of verticals. We serve global multinational companies. One very strong beneficiary of the growth is Payrix or Worldpay for Platforms, that's growing significantly year-over-year and contributing a high level of growth there, which, as you know, is allowing us to access more of the SMB part of the e-commerce market through platforms. But I would say, generally, it's widespread. And it's doing very well in terms of operating performance and benefiting from obviously increased consumer spend broadly across the market.David Mark TogutUnderstood. And just as a follow-up, in your prepared remarks, you underscored at least $1.25 billion in cash savings by year-end 2024. What's driving the at least? Do you have just increased conviction based on first quarter performance and cost takeout achievement?Stephanie L. FerrisYes. My -- look, my leadership team, led by my Corporate Performance Officer, is doing an absolute fantastic job. Future Forward is hitting on all cylinders. We have over 1,000 initiatives going on throughout the company. Everyone sitting at my leadership table and the leadership team around the company is engaged. We're seeing really strong results. And so we're just feeling really confident. And George really liked the at-least words, that's why it's there.OperatorAnd our last question for today will come from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi.Ashwin Vassant ShirvaikarMaybe sticking with the Future Forward. I was kind of hoping to understand better what's initially driving the savings. Is it the efficiency side, effectiveness growth? What sort of initiatives? And what's dropping to the bottom line versus being reinvested? And that's a question both on the OpEx side and the CapEx side. If you could kind of provide what the go-forward assumption is?Stephanie L. FerrisYes. Maybe I'll talk generally about the initiatives and investments, and then Erik can talk about how that comes in over the quarter. I would say, initially -- first of all, it's all dropping to the bottom line, so we're not reinvesting any of those initiatives at this point. But in terms of the initiatives that are driving it, you can clearly see we've reduced our TAI spend year-over-year, which is a notion of us winding down a bunch of programs that we didn't think were delivering returns. We reduced our capital expenditure as well year-over-year. Again, going through the portfolio and really rationalizing projects based on returns and prioritizing projects around delivering products and services out to customers, as well as driving automation into a lot of our processes to improve client experience. I would say, those are the big things. I think on the operating expense side, we've been very, very focused on making sure that we drive profitable revenue coming into the company, but also maintaining our expense base and trying to drive people into being much more productive. That's been the lion's share of it as we think about the first 2 quarters. I think as we go out though into 2023 and 2024, we're really focused on moving the flywheel faster around products and getting them out to market faster, getting implementations done faster, automating through AI and other types of activities, making our client experience better and more efficient. So as I've talked about really focus on efficiency and effectiveness with the client at the center and then making sure that we're -- if we are spending the capital and operating expense, are we helping our clients and the company grow. So at a high level, those are the initiatives in the near term and long term. And I'll let Erik kind of walk through how you think about it over the quarter.Erik D. HoagYes. So from a financial perspective, we've got roughly $100 million reduction in capital expenditures in the first quarter, you can see that year-over-year. In-period OpEx savings, roughly $15 million in the first quarter. And as you'd expect, Ashwin, this builds through the course of the year. As we look at margins for the balance of the year, you're going to see sequential improvement in margins with Future Forward having a meaningful -- really meaningful impact in the second half.Ashwin Vassant ShirvaikarUnderstood. And maybe I can end with a couple of numbers questions. Last time you explicitly indicated the 500 basis point macro impact. What's that now? And then interest expense, $137 million versus interest spending than savings. So what specifically happened in 1Q for the lower interest expense?Erik D. HoagSure, sure. So on the macro Merchant assumption, we had talked about 500 basis points, 5 points of headwind in our call a quarter ago. The midpoint of the Merchant guide has improved by 150 basis points, Ashwin. So I would say, the macro assumption for Merchant is now 3.5 points. Interest expense -- your second question around interest expense, interest expense is down as we did an incremental revolving credit facility to deal with 2 maturing bonds this year where we had favorable pricing on the revolving credit facility.Stephanie L. FerrisOkay. Thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. 2023 is off to a strong start and the FIS team is making great strides towards moving the company forward. I couldn't be more confident in our future. We look forward to connecting with many of you over the coming weeks and further updating you on our progress. Have a great day.OperatorThank you all for participating. This concludes today's program. You may now disconnect.]"

This new venture is intended to invest in ""forward-thinking ventures that are looking to drive meaningful change at scale [and] will help accelerate Chipotle's aggressive growth plans,"" per the release.Hartung warned, though, ""there's also a lot of pitfalls as well, so we want to be very careful, very thoughtful.""He added: ""Certainly, if there's ways we can make the job that our crews, do the jobs that our support staff do to support a restaurant easier, better and if the end result is we can run better restaurants and serve the customers in a better way, we're certainly going to look at any technology.""Story continuesFuture chips: Chippy, is an autonomous kitchen assistant that integrates culinary traditions with artificial intelligence to make tortilla chips.

(Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.)McDonald'sIs McDonald's a frontrunner in the AI game?In late 2021, McDonald's teamed up with IBM (IBM) to ""further accelerate the development and deployment"" of its automated voice ordering technology. As part of that, IBM acquired McD Tech Labs, an innovation hub created after McDonald's acquired Apprente in 2019.All these investments are part of its larger growth strategy called Accelerating the Arches 2.0.There's a bump in the road: consumer concern. Earlier this year, customers took to TikTok to share their issues with the service, such as accidentally placing nine sweet teas in an order. Meanwhile, McDonald's Australia received attention earlier this week when Gold Coast influencer Jasmine Hand felt ""exposed"" over a kiosk from having a personalized welcome message.Can I have some AI with my fries?

443,3ac93caa-ca34-398f-9071-d80fa4962231,YUM,2023-04-28,"Sweetgreen, Inc. (SG) May Report Negative Earnings: Know the Trend Ahead of Next Week's Release",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sweetgreen-inc-sg-may-report-140202817.html,1682604122,STORY,"['SG', 'YUM']","[Sweetgreen, Inc. (SG) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 4, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.36 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +20%.Revenues are expected to be $125.57 million, up 22.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.98% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Sweetgreen, Inc.For Sweetgreen, Inc.The Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -7.83%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Sweetgreen, Inc. Will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Sweetgreen, Inc. Would post a loss of $0.40 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.44, delivering a surprise of -10%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Sweetgreen, Inc. Doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsYum Brands (YUM), another stock in the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $1.13 for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +7.6%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $1.63 billion, up 5.3% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Yum has been revised 0.5% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.98%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that Yum will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Net income per share attributable to Aon shareholders, adjusted for certain items, increased 7% to $5.17 on a diluted basis, including an unfavorable impact of $0.14 per share if prior year period results were translated at current period foreign exchange rates (""foreign currency translation""), compared to $4.83 in the prior year period. Certain items that impacted first quarter results and comparisons with the prior year period are detailed in the ""Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures - Operating Income, Operating Margin and Diluted Earnings Per Share"" on page 10 of this press release.""In the first quarter, our team built momentum for 2023 by delivering strong operational performance, highlighted by 7% organic revenue growth and 70 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement,"" said Greg Case, Chief Executive Officer. ""As we move past the pandemic, our clients are telling us there are two primary areas where they are urgently looking for competitive advantage: Risk and People. As these results demonstrate, our Aon United strategy has established the firm as uniquely capable of helping clients go on offense and make better decisions that mitigate risk to their business and maximize the impact of their people.""Story continuesFIRST QUARTER 2023 FINANCIAL SUMMARYTotal revenue in the first quarter increased 5% to $3.9 billion compared to the prior year period reflecting 7% organic revenue growth and a 1% favorable impact from fiduciary investment income, partially offset by a 3% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation.Total operating expenses in the first quarter increased 4% to $2.4 billion compared to the prior year period due primarily to an increase in expense associated with 7% organic revenue growth and investments in long-term growth, partially offset by a $67 million favorable impact from foreign currency translation.Foreign currency translation in the first quarter had a $28 million, or $0.14 per share, unfavorable impact on U.S. GAAP net income and a $29 million, or $0.14 per share, unfavorable impact on adjusted net income. If currency were to remain stable at today's rates, the Company would expect an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.04 per share, or an approximately $12 million decrease in adjusted operating income, in the second quarter of 2023, and an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.14 per share, or an approximately $42 million decrease in adjusted operating income for full year 2023.Effective tax rate was 19.6% in the first quarter and in the prior year period. After adjusting to exclude the applicable tax impact associated with certain non-GAAP adjustments, the adjusted effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2023 was 19.6% compared to 19.7% in the prior year period. The primary drivers of the change in the adjusted tax rate were the geographical distribution of income and a net favorable impact from discrete items.Weighted average diluted shares outstanding decreased to 207.1 million in the first quarter compared to 216.4 million in the prior year period. The Company repurchased 1.8 million Class A Ordinary Shares for approximately $550 million in the first quarter. As of March 31, 2023, the Company had approximately $5.5 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program.YEAR TO DATE 2023 CASH FLOW SUMMARYCash flows provided by operations for the first three months of 2023 decreased $20 million, or 4%, to $443 million compared to the prior year period, primarily due to higher cash tax payments, partially offset by strong operating income growth.Free cash flow, defined as cash flows from operations less capital expenditures, decreased 17%, to $367 million for the first three months of 2023 compared to the prior year period, reflecting a decrease in cash flows from operations and a $53 million increase in capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were elevated in the first quarter compared to the prior year period as we initiated a number of projects with spend heavily weighted in the first quarter across technology to drive long-term growth and real estate aligned with our Smart Working strategy.FIRST QUARTER 2023 REVENUE REVIEWThe first quarter revenue reviews provided below include supplemental information related to organic revenue growth, which is a non-GAAP measure that is described in detail in ""Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures - Organic Revenue Growth and Free Cash Flow"" on page 9 of this press release.Three Months Ended March 31,(millions)20232022% ChangeLess: Currency ImpactLess: Fiduciary Investment IncomeLess: Acquisitions, Divestitures &amp; OtherOrganic Revenue GrowthRevenueCommercial Risk Solutions$    1,778$    1,7193 %(3) %2 %(2) %6 %Reinsurance Solutions1,07797610(2)219Health Solutions6716385(3)——8Wealth Solutions3503451(4)—(1)6Eliminations(5)(8)N/AN/AN/AN/AN/ATotal revenue$    3,871$    3,6705 %(3) %1 %— %7 %Total revenue increased $201 million, or 5%, to $3,871 million, compared to the prior year period, with organic revenue growth of 7%, driven by ongoing strong retention, net new business generation, and management of the renewal book portfolio, and a 1% favorable impact from fiduciary investment income, partially offset by a 3% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation.Commercial Risk Solutions organic revenue growth of 6% reflects strong growth across most major geographies driven by strong retention, net new business generation, and management of the renewal book portfolio. Growth in retail brokerage was highlighted by double-digit growth in EMEA, Latin America, and the Pacific driven by continued strength in core P&amp;C. The U.S. grew modestly after growing double-digits in the prior year period and reflecting the impact of the external M&amp;A and IPO markets on M&amp;A services. Results also reflect strong growth globally in the affinity business across both consumer and business solutions, including growth in the travel and events practice and Digital Client Solutions. On average globally, exposures and pricing were positive, resulting in a modestly positive market impact.Reinsurance Solutions organic revenue growth of 9% reflects strong growth in treaty, driven by strong retention and continued net new business generation, as well as double-digit growth in both the Strategy and Technology Group and facultative placements. Market impact was modestly positive on results in the quarter. The majority of revenue in our treaty portfolio is recurring in nature and is recorded in connection with the major renewal periods that take place throughout the first half of the year.Health Solutions organic revenue growth of 8% reflects growth globally in core health and benefits brokerage, driven by strong retention, net new business generation, and management of the renewal book portfolio. Strength in the core was highlighted by double-digit growth in Asia Pacific, U.K., and Latin America. Results also reflect double-digit growth in Human Capital, driven by data and advisory solutions.Wealth Solutions organic revenue growth of 6% reflects growth in Retirement, driven by higher advisory demand and project-related work related to pension de-risking and ongoing impacts of regulatory changes. In Investments, a decrease in AUM-based delegated investment management revenue due to equity market and interest rate movements was partially offset by higher advisory demand and project-related work.FIRST QUARTER 2023 EXPENSE REVIEWThree Months Ended March 31,(millions)20232022$ Change% ChangeExpensesCompensation and benefits$          1,792$          1,767$               251 %Information technology1391231613Premises757234Depreciation of fixed assets3838——Amortization and impairment of intangible assets2528(3)(11)Other general expense3292755420Total operating expenses$          2,398$          2,303$               954 %Compensation and benefits expense increased $25 million, or 1%, compared to the prior year period due primarily to an increase in expense associated with 7% organic revenue growth, partially offset by a $55 million favorable impact from foreign currency translation.Information technology expense increased $16 million, or 13%, compared to the prior year period due primarily to ongoing investments in Aon Business Services-enabled technology platforms to drive long-term growth and continued investment in core infrastructure and security.Premises expense increased $3 million, or 4%, compared to the prior year period.Depreciation of fixed assets was flat compared to the prior year period.Amortization and impairment of intangible assets decreased $3 million, or 11%, compared to the prior year period.Other general expenses increased $54 million, or 20%, compared to the prior year period due primarily to an increase in expense associated with 7% organic revenue growth, including an increase in business travel expense, especially compared to the prior year period as business travel was suppressed by COVID-19.FIRST QUARTER 2023 INCOME SUMMARYCertain noteworthy items impacted adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margins in the first quarters of 2023 and 2022, which are also described in detail in ""Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures - Operating Income, Operating Margin and Diluted Earnings Per Share"" on page 10 of this press release.Three Months Ended March 31,(millions)20232022% ChangeRevenue$      3,871$      3,6705 %Expenses2,3982,3034 %Operating income$      1,473$      1,3678 %Operating margin38.1 %37.2 %Operating income - as adjusted$      1,498$      1,3957 %Operating margin - as adjusted38.7 %38.0 %Operating income increased $106 million, or 8%, and operating margin increased 90 basis points to 38.1%, each compared to the prior year period.

Interest expense increased $20 million to $111 million compared to the prior year period, reflecting primarily an increase in total debt and higher interest rates. Other pension expense was $17 million, compared to $3 million in the prior year period. Other income (expense) decreased $36 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to a gain on the sale of a business in the prior year period that did not repeat and expense from the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on the remeasurement of assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies.Conference Call, Presentation Slides and Webcast DetailsThe Company will host a conference call on Friday, April 28, 2023 at 7:30 a.m., central time.

The factors identified above are not exhaustive. Aon and its subsidiaries operate in a dynamic business environment in which new risks may emerge frequently. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the dates on which they are made. In addition, results for prior periods are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any future period. Further information concerning Aon and its businesses, including factors that potentially could materially affect Aon's financial results, is contained in Aon's filings with the SEC. See Aon's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 for a further discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties applicable to Aon and its businesses.

Aon is not under, and expressly disclaims, any obligation to update or alter any forward-looking statement that it may make from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.Explanation of Non-GAAP MeasuresThis communication includes supplemental information not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (""U.S. GAAP""), including organic revenue growth, free cash flow, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted net income attributable to Aon shareholders, adjusted net income per share, and adjusted effective tax rate that exclude the effects of intangible asset amortization and impairment, pension settlements, capital expenditures, and certain other noteworthy items that affected results for the comparable periods. Organic revenue growth includes the impact of intercompany activity and excludes foreign exchange rate changes, acquisitions, divestitures, transfers between revenue lines, fiduciary investment income, and gains or losses on derivatives accounted for as hedges. Currency impact represents the effect on prior year period results if they were translated at current period foreign exchange rates. Reconciliations to the closest U.S. GAAP measure for each non-GAAP measure presented in this communication are provided in the attached appendices. Supplemental organic revenue growth information and additional measures that exclude the effects of certain items noted above do not affect net income or any other U.S. GAAP reported amounts. Free cash flow is cash flows from operating activity less capital expenditures. The adjusted effective tax rate excludes the applicable tax impact associated with expenses for estimated intangible asset amortization and impairment, and certain other noteworthy items. Management believes that these measures are important to make meaningful period-to-period comparisons and that this supplemental information is helpful to investors.

If you want to see more places in this selection, go to the 5 Best Places to Live in South Carolina for Retirees.Despite the possibility of a recession in the US in 2023, South Carolina's economy remains strong and is expected to weather any potential impacts relatively well. Concerns regarding a potential recession stem from the current climate of high inflation and increasing interest rates. Research economist at the University of South Carolina (USC) Joseph Von Nessen attributes the cause of high inflation to imbalanced supply and demand dynamics across the country, including in South Carolina.  The influx of federal stimulus, amounting to $6 trillion, throughout 2020 and 2021 has resulted in a surge of consumer demand, contributing significantly to the current inflation levels. However, Von Nessen remains optimistic about South Carolina's economy and anticipates that it will continue to grow for the foreseeable future, barring any unexpected circumstances.The state's recovery from the pandemic has also been robust, with strong employment gains across most industries and regions. In 2022, South Carolina experienced a historic $10 billion in economic investment, with a significant portion of that being driven by the automotive industry's shift towards electric vehicles. Investment in the industry has been spurred by major announcements, such as the expansion of the BMW Plant in Spartanburg, which includes a $1.7 billion battery assembly plant in Woodruff. Additionally, Envision AECS, a Japanese electric battery technology company, also announced its plans to invest $810 million in building a battery cell plant in Florence County, while Redwood Materials Inc. announced a record $3.5 billion investment in Berkeley County. The trend is expected to continue, with Richland County anticipating a $323 million investment in a manufacturing plant for electric battery components. In addition to the automobile companies, some of the other popular multinationals operating in South Carolina include McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX).Story continuesSouth Carolina's strong economy offers retirees easy access to a wide range of amenities and services, making it an attractive destination for retirement. Additionally, the state is tax-friendly for retirees since it does not tax Social Security income and offers tax breaks for retirees. The state also has a lower cost of living compared to other popular retirement destinations. According to the cost of living data compiled by the Missouri Economic Research and Information Center (MERIC), South Carolina is the fourteenth most affordable US state to reside in as of 2022. The cost of living index for the state stands at 89.3, which reflects that the cost of living in the Palmetto State is 10.7% lower than the national average. Nine of the 16 shortlisted places in this article have a cost of living that is even lower than the state average. Moreover, the moderate climate of South Carolina, with warm summers and relatively mild winters, makes it an ideal destination for retirees looking to avoid harsh winter weather. South Carolina is also home to numerous historic cities and towns, including Charleston and Greenville, which offer a vibrant cultural scene with museums, theatres, and galleries.south, carolina, sc, downtown, park, america, usa, town, river, night, skyline, reedy, dusk, united, southern, falls, states, city, us, buildings, greenville, townscape, cityscapeSean Pavone/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyTo determine the 16 best places to live in South Carolina for retirees, we utilized a consensus opinion-based approach based on seven factors, including the cost of living, demographics, median house prices, safety, transportation, recreational activities, and overall quality of life.

""Small improvements are building up to big results,"" Palmer wrote.First, an improved grading system for franchisee performance will unlock big results, the analyst said. By having a more engaged franchisee base, Palmer thinks McDonald's stands to produce better profits over time.The enhanced grading system will essentially weed out lagging franchisees, leaving more financially sound ones.Silvia Ruiz prepares a specialty sandwich at a McDonald's restaurant in Chicago. (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Second, McDonald's introduction of a ""ready on arrival"" digital ordering system could yield market share gains, according to Palmer's research.The mobile ordering technology integrates geofencing that can notify restaurants when customers are arriving. The app notifies the restaurant when a mobile order customer is within three minutes of the location, speeding up the food pick-up process.Palmer believes this will help unclog McDonald's drive-throughs during peak dinner hours and bolster customer perception.And lastly, Palmer is taking a bullish stance on new cooking techniques for patties. The meat will be cooked in smaller batches and grilled with onions, resulting in hotter, juicier, and more flavorful burgers, Palmer believes. The logic: Better burgers, better sales.The operational tweaks come as McDonald's stock has packed on the pounds this year.Shares of the Dow Jones Industrial Average component have gained nearly 12% year to date, spurred on by investors' flight to safety and a series of strong quarters.The stretch of strong quarters for McDonald's continued into the start of 2023.McDonald's first quarter same-store sales rose 12.6% both in the US and internationally. Wall Street analysts modeled for same-store sales rising 7.5% in the US and 8.2% globally.Story continuesBut there are a few red flags to the McDonald's investment story, partially explaining why management is standing up new profit-driving initiatives.Morgan Spurlock of the documentary 'Super Size Me', where he ate only McDonald's for 30 days, shown with a Big Mac, 26 May 2004. (Photo by Fairfax Media via Getty Images) (The Sydney Morning Herald via Getty Images)McDonald's said it's seeing ""pressure"" on its key units per transaction measure, it told investors this week on its earnings call. That means the typical cost-conscious McDonald's customer is balking at higher menu prices.""We are seeing in some places resistance to pricing, more resistance than we saw at the outset,"" McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski warned.That has Wall Street on high alert for a sales disappointment in the second quarter.""We do think the one-year global same-store sales has hit a near-term peak in 1Q23, and we expect moderation over the next seven quarters as both year over year pricing and underlying year over year employment gains slow down (but stay positive) in most major markets,"" JPMorgan analyst John Ivankoe wrote in a note to clients.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

McDonald's (MCD) has hinted at a new digital enhancement that allows employees to know when a customer is nearby so they can begin prepping their food. Even execs from the big soft drink and snack makers — The Coca-Cola Co. (KO) and PepsiCo (PEP) — have weighed in. But the fast-fooders have been the real players. Here's a pocket guide to some innovations — and a few yellow flags as well:ChipotleIn a call with investors, CEO Brian Niccol said the fast-casual chain has discussed the idea of AI internally.""We've worked with a lot of our employees to identify what are the tasks that they would love to see us bring automation to, or AI, so that hopefully, the role can become less complicated...I think there's just other places in the back of the restaurant where we have the ability to automate, whether it's on the digital make-line or other tasks...""For instance, last fall Chipotle rolled out testing for a new kitchen management system to streamline operations, plus a new robot called Chippy that makes tortilla chips.Then, in an interview with Yahoo Finance on Wednesday, Chipotle CFO Jack Hartung said AI presents ""endless possibilities"" that it is exploring with its Cultivate Next fund. This new venture is intended to invest in ""forward-thinking ventures that are looking to drive meaningful change at scale [and] will help accelerate Chipotle's aggressive growth plans,"" per the release.Hartung warned, though, ""there's also a lot of pitfalls as well, so we want to be very careful, very thoughtful.""He added: ""Certainly, if there's ways we can make the job that our crews, do the jobs that our support staff do to support a restaurant easier, better and if the end result is we can run better restaurants and serve the customers in a better way, we're certainly going to look at any technology.""Story continuesFuture chips: Chippy, is an autonomous kitchen assistant that integrates culinary traditions with artificial intelligence to make tortilla chips. (Courtesy: Chipotle). (Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.)McDonald'sIs McDonald's a frontrunner in the AI game?In late 2021, McDonald's teamed up with IBM (IBM) to ""further accelerate the development and deployment"" of its automated voice ordering technology.

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about McDonald's (MCD) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.McDonald's currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.66, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 25 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.66 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 25 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 15 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 60% and 12% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for MCDBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for MCDCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for McDonald's here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying McDonald's, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Story continuesZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Should You Invest in MCD?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for McDonald's, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 3.3% over the past month to $10.83.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for McDonald's. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for McDonald's may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To see more such stocks, click 5 Best Staffing Company Stocks To Buy Now.The 2022 stock market crash, rising inflation and the Federal Reserve's flurry of rate hikes are forcing companies to announce massive layoffs to cut costs. As employers cut back on spending, staffing and HR-related services companies were affected. But there’s another side to this picture. Amid layoffs, more and more individuals sign up for workforce and job hunting platforms to find new jobs, ultimately helping staffing companies. Data also shows that a major chunk of the laid off workforce are able to find new jobs pretty soon. Jobs platform company ZipRecruiter recently conducted a survey to see the state of the employees who were laid off between December and January. The survey included about 2,000 people. Results show that almost half of the surveyed individuals are working in new jobs, while another quarter said they already have new job offers in hand.The survey said that people from advertising, auto and transportation sectors were most likely to have received job offers after getting laid off.While major technology companies made headlines earlier this year with huge layoffs, there are companies that are continuing to hire more and more workers. For example, Boeing plans to hire 10,000 workers this year. Chipotle also plans to hire about 15,000 workers. Hiring in industries that were devastated by the pandemic and are in recovery mode remains strong. These areas include restaurants, airlines and hotels.Analysts also believe that once inflation gets under control and the Federal Reserve begins to pause and eventually cut interest rates, companies across the board will hire again, which could help staffing and HR platforms.More and more young people are turning to digital staffing platforms to find jobs, upskill themselves and network. The biggest example is Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s LinkedIn, where growth and engagement are making new records. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s CEO Satya Nadella said the following about LinkedIn during the company’s latest earnings call:Story continuesPeople and companies continue to look to LinkedIn to connect, learn, sell and get hired. We once again saw record engagement among our more than 900 million members.Three members are signing up every second. Over 80% of these members are from outside the United States. And as the members come to the platform to find and share professional knowledge and expertise, newsletter creation was up 10x year-over-year. Skills are the new currency and people are increasingly investing in their skill-building to keep up with their changing roles in industries. We offer more than 20,000 courses in 11 languages and companies are also turning to a skills-based approach in place of degree or pedigree to identify qualified talent, with more than 45% of the hires on LinkedIn explicitly using skills data to fill their roles. Finally, LinkedIn Marketing Solutions continues to be a leader in B2B digital advertising, helping companies deliver the right message to the right audience on a safe and trusted platform.Best Staffing Company Stocks To Buy NowMethodologyFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and their holdings and picked top 12 companies that offer staffing, HR, workforce, payroll and related solutions and services.

Reported operating income was $72 million, or 12.8 percent of sales, compared with $138 million, or 21.2 percent of sales, in the prior year period. Normalized operating income was $82 million, or 14.5 percent of sales, compared with $145 million, or 22.3 percent of sales, in the prior year period.The Outdoor &amp; Recreation segment generated net sales of $270 million compared with $388 million in the prior year period, reflecting a core sales decline of 27.4 percent, as well as the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange. Reported operating loss was $1 million, or negative 0.4 percent of sales, compared with operating income of $46 million, or 11.9 percent of sales, in the prior year period. Normalized operating income was $13 million, or 4.8 percent of sales, compared with $50 million, or 12.9 percent of sales, in the prior year period.Restructuring and Savings InitiativeThe company previously announced a restructuring and savings initiative, Project Phoenix, that aims to strengthen the company by leveraging its scale to further reduce complexity, streamlining its operating model and driving operational efficiencies.Project Phoenix is expected to be substantially implemented by the end of 2023. It incorporates a variety of initiatives designed to simplify the organizational structure, streamline the company’s real estate, centralize its supply chain functions, which include manufacturing, distribution, transportation and customer service, transition to a unified One Newell go-to-market model in key international geographies, and otherwise reduce overhead costs. The company implemented a new operating model in the first quarter, consolidating its prior five operating segments into three operating segments: Home &amp; Commercial Solutions, Learning &amp; Development and Outdoor &amp; Recreation.The company's expectations for savings and charges in connection with Project Phoenix remain unchanged. The company expects to realize annualized pre-tax savings in the range of $220 million to $250 million when fully implemented, with $140 million to $160 million expected to be realized in 2023. Restructuring and related charges associated with these actions are estimated to be in the range of $100 million to $130 million and are expected to be substantially incurred by the end of 2023. During the first quarter 2023, the company incurred restructuring charges of $36 million and realized savings of $18 million related to Project Phoenix. The restructuring plan is expected to result in the elimination of approximately 13 percent of office positions. The company began reducing headcount in the first quarter 2023, with most of these actions expected to be completed by the end of 2023, subject to local law and consultation requirements.Outlook for Second Quarter and Full Year 2023The company initiated its outlook for second quarter 2023 and reaffirmed its full year 2023 outlook.Q2 2023 OutlookFull Year 2023 OutlookNet Sales$2.13 to $2.24 billion$8.4 to $8.6 billionCore Sales14% to 10% decline8% to 6% declineNormalized Operating Margin6.5% to 8.0%9.6% to 10.1%Normalized EPS$0.10 to $0.18$0.95 to $1.08The company now expects full year 2023 results to be towards the low end of the outlook range.For full year 2023, the company expects to deliver operating cash flow in the range of $700 million to $900 million, including approximately $95 million to $120 million in cash payments associated with Project Phoenix.The company has presented forward-looking statements regarding core sales, normalized operating margin and normalized earnings per share. These non-GAAP financial measures are derived by excluding certain amounts, expenses or income, from the corresponding financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The determination of the amounts that are excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures is a matter of management judgement and depends upon, among other factors, the nature of the underlying expense or income amounts recognized in a given period in reliance on the exception provided by item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K. We are unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking normalized operating margin or normalized earnings per share to their most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures because such information is not available, and management cannot reliably predict all of the necessary components of such GAAP measures without unreasonable effort or expense. In addition, we believe such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on the company's future financial results. These non-GAAP financial measures are preliminary estimates and are subject to risks and uncertainties, including, among others, changes in connection with quarter-end and year-end adjustments. Any variation between the company's actual results and preliminary financial data set forth above may be material.Conference CallNewell Brands’ first quarter 2023 earnings conference call will be held today, April 28, at 9:30 a.m. ET. A link to the webcast is provided under Events &amp; Presentations in the Investors section of the company’s website at www.newellbrands.com. A webcast replay will be made available in the Quarterly Earnings section of the company’s website.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThis release contains non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") and includes a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.The company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures that are included in this press release and the additional financial information both to explain its results to stockholders and the investment community and in the internal evaluation and management of its businesses. The company’s management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures and the information they provide are useful to investors since these measures (a) permit investors to view the company’s performance and liquidity using the same tools that management uses to evaluate the company’s past performance, reportable segments, prospects for future performance and liquidity, and (b) determine certain elements of management incentive compensation.The company’s management believes that core sales provides a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales on a consistent basis as it excludes the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures, retail store openings and closings, certain market and category exits, and changes in foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. The effect of changes in foreign exchange on reported sales is calculated by applying the prior year average monthly exchange rates to the current year local currency sales amounts (excluding acquisitions and divestitures), with the difference between the current year reported sales and constant currency sales presented as the foreign exchange impact increase or decrease in core sales. The company’s management believes that ""normalized"" gross margin, ""normalized"" operating income, ""normalized"" operating margin, ""normalized EBITDA"", ""normalized"" net income, ""normalized"" diluted earnings per share, ""normalized"" interest and ""normalized"" income tax benefit or expense, which exclude restructuring and restructuring-related expenses and one-time and other events such as costs related to the extinguishment of debt, certain tax benefits and charges, impairment charges, pension settlement charges, divestiture costs, integration and financing of acquired businesses, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, inflationary adjustments, fire related loss, net of insurance recoveries and certain other items, are useful because they provide investors with a meaningful perspective on the current underlying performance of the company’s core ongoing operations and liquidity. ""Normalized EBITDA"" is an ongoing liquidity measure (that excludes non-cash items) and is calculated as normalized earnings before interest, tax depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation expense.The company determines the tax effect of the items excluded from normalized diluted earnings per share by applying the estimated effective rate for the applicable jurisdiction in which the pre-tax items were incurred, and for which realization of the resulting tax benefit, if any, is expected. In certain situations in which an item excluded from normalized results impacts income tax expense, the company utilizes a ""with"" and ""without"" approach to determine normalized income tax benefit or expense.The company defines ""net debt"" as short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt less cash and cash equivalents. ""Free cash flow"" is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. ""Free cash flow productivity"" is defined as the ratio of free cash flow to normalized net income. We are unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking free cash flow productivity to its most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measure because such information is not available, and management cannot reliably predict all of the necessary components of such GAAP measure without unreasonable effort or expense.While the company believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the company’s performance and liquidity, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for or superior to the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similar measures presented by other companies.About Newell BrandsNewell Brands (NASDAQ: NWL) is a leading global consumer goods company with a strong portfolio of well-known brands, including Rubbermaid, Sharpie, Graco, Coleman, Rubbermaid Commercial Products, Yankee Candle, Paper Mate, FoodSaver, Dymo, EXPO, Elmer’s, Oster, NUK, Spontex and Campingaz.

These statements generally can be identified by the use of words or phrases, including, but not limited to, ""guidance,"" ""outlook,"" ""intend,"" ""anticipate,"" ""believe,"" ""estimate,"" ""project,"" ""target,"" ""plan,"" ""expect,"" ""setting up,"" ""beginning to,"" ""will,"" ""should,"" ""would,"" ""could,"" ""resume,"" ""are confident that,"" ""remain optimistic,"" ""seek to,"" or similar statements. We caution that forward-looking statements are not guarantees because there are inherent difficulties in predicting future results. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, including impairment charges and accounting for income taxes. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to:our ability to optimize costs and cash flow and mitigate the impact of retailer inventory rebalancing through discretionary and overhead spend management, advertising and promotion expense optimization, demand forecast and supply plan adjustments and actions to improve working capital;our dependence on the strength of retail and consumer demand and commercial and industrial sectors of the economy in various countries around the world;our ability to improve productivity, reduce complexity and streamline operations;our ability to manage any actual or perceived ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including as a result of any additional variants of the virus or the efficacy and distribution of vaccines;competition with other manufacturers and distributors of consumer products;major retailers’ strong bargaining power and consolidation of our customers;supply chain and operational disruptions in the markets in which we operate, whether as a result of the actual or perceived effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or broader geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions, including the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine;changes in the prices and availability of labor, transportation, raw materials and sourced products, including significant inflation, and our ability to offset cost increases through pricing and productivity in a timely manner;the cost and outcomes of governmental investigations, inspections, lawsuits, legislative requests or other actions by third parties, the potential outcomes of which could exceed policy limits, to the extent insured;our ability to develop innovative new products, to develop, maintain and strengthen end-user brands and to realize the benefits of increased advertising and promotion spend;our ability to consistently maintain effective internal control over financial reporting;the risks inherent to our foreign operations, including currency fluctuations, exchange controls and pricing restrictions;future events that could adversely affect the value of our assets and/or stock price and require additional impairment charges;unexpected costs or expenses associated with dispositions;our ability to effectively execute our turnaround plan, including Project Ovid and Project Phoenix;risks related to our substantial indebtedness, potential increases in interest rates or changes in our credit ratings;a failure or breach of one of our key information technology systems, networks, processes or related controls or those of our service providers;the impact of U.S. and foreign regulations on our operations, including the impact of tariffs and environmental remediation costs and legislation and regulatory actions related to data privacy and climate change;the potential inability to attract, retain and motivate key employees;changes in tax laws and the resolution of tax contingencies resulting in additional tax liabilities;product liability, product recalls or related regulatory actions;our ability to protect intellectual property rights;significant increases in the funding obligations related to our pension plans; andother factors listed from time to time in our SEC filings, including but not limited to our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and our other SEC filings.The consolidated condensed financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""U.S. GAAP""). Management’s application of U.S. GAAP requires the pervasive use of estimates and assumptions in preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements. The company continues to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, inflationary and supply chain pressures, and the indirect macroeconomic impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which has required greater use of estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements. Although we have made our best estimates based upon current information, actual results could materially differ and may require future changes to such estimates and assumptions, including reserves, which may result in future expense.The information contained in this press release and the tables is as of the date indicated. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or developments.NEWELL BRANDS INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (UNAUDITED)(Amounts in millions, except per share data)Three Months Ended March 31,20232022% ChangeNet sales$1,805$2,388(24.4)%Cost of products sold1,3231,648Gross profit482740(34.9)%Selling, general and administrative expenses480518(7.3)%Restructuring costs, net385Operating income (loss)(36)217NMNon-operating expenses:Interest expense, net6859Other (income) expense, net12(118)Income (loss) before income taxes(116)276NMIncome tax provision (benefit)(14)48Net income (loss)$(102)$228NMWeighted average common shares outstanding:Basic413.9421.9Diluted413.9424.7Earnings (loss) per share:Basic$(0.25)$0.54Diluted$(0.25)$0.54Dividends per share$0.23$0.23*NM - NOT MEANINGFULNEWELL BRANDS INC.CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (UNAUDITED)(Amounts in millions)March 31, 2023December 31, 2022AssetsCurrent assetsCash and cash equivalents$271$287Accounts receivable, net1,2181,250Inventories2,2402,203Prepaid expenses and other current assets326312Total current assets4,0554,052Property, plant and equipment, net1,2131,184Operating lease assets571578Goodwill3,3053,298Other intangible assets, net2,6352,649Deferred income taxes798810Other assets699691TOTAL ASSETS$13,276$13,262Liabilities and stockholders' equityCurrent liabilitiesAccounts payable$1,092$1,062Accrued compensation112123Other accrued liabilities1,2351,272Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt852621Total current liabilities3,2913,078Long-term debt4,7764,756Deferred income taxes501520Operating lease liabilities505512Other noncurrent liabilities870877Total liabilities9,9439,743Total stockholders' equity3,3333,519TOTAL LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY$13,276$13,262NEWELL BRANDS INC.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS (UNAUDITED)(Amounts in millions)Three Months Ended March 31,20232022Cash flows from operating activities:Net income (loss)$(102)$228Adjustments to reconcile net income (loss) to net cash used in operating activities:Depreciation and amortization8176Gain from sale of business—(130)Deferred income taxes6326Stock based compensation expense1114Other, net4(2)Changes in operating accounts excluding the effects of divestiture:Accounts receivable4514Inventories(27)(403)Accounts payable2625Accrued liabilities and other(121)(420)Net cash used in operating activities(77)(272)Cash flows from investing activities:Proceeds from sale of divested business—620Capital expenditures(83)(70)Other investing activities, net159Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities(68)559Cash flows from financing activities:Net proceeds from short-term debt232—Payments on current portion of long-term debt—(1)Repurchase of shares of common stock—(275)Cash dividends(97)(100)Equity compensation activity and other, net(7)(17)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities128(393)Exchange rate effect on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash(1)8Decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash(18)(98)Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of period303477Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period$285$379Supplemental disclosures:Restricted cash at beginning of period$16$37Restricted cash at end of period1435NEWELL BRANDS INC.RECONCILIATION OF GAAP AND NON-GAAP INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)CERTAIN LINE ITEMS(Amounts in millions, except per share data)Three Months Ended March 31, 2023GAAPRestructuringTransactionNon-GAAPMeasureand restructuring-Acquisitioncosts andMeasureReportedrelated costsamortizationother [1]Normalized*Net sales$1,805$—$—$—$1,805Cost of products sold1,323(5)—(2)1,316Gross profit4825—248926.7%27.1%Selling, general and administrative expenses480(8)(19)(7)44626.6%24.7%Restructuring costs, net38(38)———Operating income (loss)(36)5119943(2.0)%2.4%Non-operating (income) expense80——(10)70Income (loss) before income taxes(116)511919(27)Income tax provision (benefit) [2](14)135(5)(1)Net income (loss)$(102)$38$14$24$(26)Diluted earnings (loss) per share **$(0.25)$0.09$0.03$0.06$(0.06)*Normalized results are financial measures that are not in accordance with GAAP and exclude the above normalized adjustments.

(NWL), may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Newell Brands is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for NWL in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at a loss of 3 cents per share for NWL, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 4 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for NWL, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +16.67% heading into earnings season.Newell Brands Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseNewell Brands Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseNewell Brands Inc. price-eps-surprise | Newell Brands Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that NWL has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1(Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Newell Brands, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

461,bf254a46-0473-3dc7-874d-dfc7216e3d9c,TROW,2023-04-28,Is T. Rowe Price Real Estate (TRREX) a Strong Mutual Fund Pick Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/t-rowe-price-real-estate-110011455.html,1682593211,STORY,"['TROW', '^GSPC']","[If you have been looking for Mutual Fund Equity Report funds, a place to start could be T. Rowe Price Real Estate (TRREX). TRREX bears a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 1 (Strong Buy), which is based on various forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.History of Fund/ManagerT. Rowe Price is based in Baltimore, MD, and is the manager of TRREX. Since T. Rowe Price Real Estate made its debut in February of 1998, TRREX has garnered more than $759 million in assets. Nina Jones is the fund's current manager and has held that role since January of 2019.PerformanceInvestors naturally seek funds with strong performance. This fund has delivered a 5-year annualized total return of 3.62%, and it sits in the bottom third among its category peers. If you're interested in shorter time frames, do not dismiss looking at the fund's 3-year annualized total return of 10.95%, which places it in the middle third during this time-frame.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. Compared to the category average of 19.16%, the standard deviation of TRREX over the past three years is 20.49%. The standard deviation of the fund over the past 5 years is 20.58% compared to the category average of 16.63%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.Risk FactorsInvestors should not forget about beta, an important way to measure a mutual fund's risk compared to the market as a whole. TRREX has a 5-year beta of 0.93, which means it is likely to be less volatile than the market average. Because alpha represents a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark, which is the S&amp;P 500 in this case, one should pay attention to this metric as well. The fund has produced a negative alpha over the past 5 years of -5.73, which shows that managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.Story continuesExpensesFor investors, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is key, since costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing. Competition is heating up in this space, and a lower cost product will likely outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, all things being equal. In terms of fees, TRREX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.82% compared to the category average of 1.19%. So, TRREX is actually cheaper than its peers from a cost perspective.Investors should also note that the minimum initial investment for the product is $2,500 and that each subsequent investment needs to be at $100.Bottom LineOverall, T. Rowe Price Real Estate ( TRREX ) has a high Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively weak performance, average downside risk, and lower fees, T. Rowe Price Real Estate ( TRREX ) looks like a great potential choice for investors right now.This could just be the start of your research on TRREXin the Mutual Fund Equity Report category.

Visa (NYSE: V)’s net income margin continues to be among the best in the world with growing dividends and buybacks continuing to please its shareholders. Like American Express Company (NYSE: AXP), Visa’s report showed continued rise in spending as interest in travel remains strong, with the latest report marking its eight straight quarter of rising top and bottom lines.Fiscal Second Quarter FiguresFor the first three months of 2023, Visa’s revenues rose 11% YoY as they amounted to $8 billion, topping the $7.80 billion that Fact Set expected.While its credit card competitor American Express missed estimates and reported a 12% earnings drop that resulted in EPS of $2.40 per share last Thursday, Visa’s adjusted earnings jumped 19.4% to $2.09 per share, topping the expected $1.99. Unlike Visa’s, American Express’ bottom line didn’t benefit from its top line skyrocketing 22% that led to a record revenue of $14.28 billion, topping $13.98 billion that FactSet expected. Unlike Visa and Mastercard (NYSE: MA), American Express carries balances on its books. Visa and Mastercard make money from credit and debit card transaction fees.Rising VolumesPayments volume rose 10% while processed transactions increased 12% compared to last year’s quarter. Volume of international transactions rose 24% to $2.75 billion but when Europe is excluded, it actually skyrocketed 32%. Although US and Europe make 68% of Visa's total payment volumes, the main catalyst for revenue growth actually lies in international transactions as Visa has many new markets in which it can grow. Data processing revenues is a more mature segment that grew more modestly at 10% to $3.82 billion, but it still smashed expectations of $3.77 billion.Like net revenues, total operating expenses rose 11%. To maintain a strong net income margin above 50%, Visa knows it's crucial to control these expenses.Story continuesA Favorable Position With A Promising OutlookVisa is the largest publicly traded payments processing company in the world and like in any industry, size matters a lot in the payments processing industry as the bigger the dollar volume a company processes and cards it has on its payment network, the more likely businesses will accept their payment methods. Being the industry leader who is constantly strengthening its competitive position, it's no wonder that Visa’s outlook looks promising. Moreover, Visa and Mastercard form a duopoly when it comes to digitizing payments and with the society moving towards a cashless future, the undergoing trend is further fueling their revenues.A Proof Of ResilienceOnce again, Visa demonstrated its resilience in virtually any macroeconomic environment. It continued thriving in these challenging times, including the latest banking crisis and higher interest rates that caused the economic slowdown.Mastercard Is NextVisa’s peer, Mastercard, will be publishing its results later today. Although like Visa, Mastercard is also one of the steadiest stocks in the market, analysts expect Mastercard’s earnings to drop 1.8% to $2.71 per share despite an expected surge of 8.4% in revenue which is expected at $5.64 billion.Don't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

466,c2855341-67d1-3324-886e-8d5ea27a54cf,MLM,2023-04-28,Martin Marietta (MLM) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/martin-marietta-mlm-earnings-expected-140202026.html,1682604122,STORY,['MLM'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Martin Marietta (MLM) reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 4. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis seller of granite, limestone, sand and gravel is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.99 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +153.9%.Revenues are expected to be $1.19 billion, up 3.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.05% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Martin Marietta?For Martin Marietta, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -14.43%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Martin Marietta will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Martin Marietta would post earnings of $3.03 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.04, delivering a surprise of +0.33%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Martin Marietta doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Runway Growth Finance Corp. RWAY, Cisco Systems CSCO, Kimberly Clark KMB, NiSource NI and Omnicom Group OMC.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:5 Top Ultra-Safe Stocks to Buy as Economic Downturn LoomsElevated prices of essential commodities, considerably higher interest rates, and at present tightening credit situations no doubt are likely to weigh on business investment and consumer outlays in the United States. First-quarter GDP growth is widely expected to be moderate, while the index of future economic activity recently posted a record drop, indicating a forthcoming economic slump.The Leading Economic Index (LEI) of the Conference Board dropped to 108.4 in March from the revised reading of 109.7 in February and has registered the 12th monthly drop in a row. It’s also the lowest reading since November 2020, when the economy grappled with the outbreak of the coronavirus.From September 2022 to March 2023, the LEI fell by 4.5%, thereby signaling a recession for quite a long time. Justyna Zabinska-La Monica, Senior Manager at the Conference Board, in reality, expects the U.S. economy to be in recession by mid-2023 (read more: 5 Top Stocks to Buy as Recession Fright Intensifies).Investment activities in businesses, meanwhile, are softening, thanks to stubbornly high inflation. Orders for durable goods have decreased in recent times, while spending took a beating due to the higher cost of capital. China’s reopening and solid first-quarter GDP growth are yet to uplift business sentiment in the United States.Being an interest-rate-sensitive sector, housing is also struggling at the moment. Home sales lessened over the past year, while construction activities decreased, indicating substantial pressure on the housing sector in the upcoming months. Let us also not forget that housing affordability remains at an all-time low.Story continuesAmid all these, the banking crisis in the United States has increased worries about economic growth. The recent collapse of some of the regional banks has impacted credit growth, and in all likelihood, is expected to derail real GDP growth. What’s more, First Republic Banks’ recent declaration that its deposits decreased significantly in the first quarter reignited fears about the current health of the entire banking system.The United States, by the way, is already witnessing a freight recession, signaling a broader slowdown in economic growth. Fewer trucks are now delivering goods, leading to a significant decline in diesel prices.Given that the United States is worryingly close to an economic downturn, the stock market is now undoubtedly subjected to bouts of volatility. Hence, astute investors should place their bets on ultra-safe stocks that can counter such upheavals in the market and provide a steady stream of income.To select such stocks, we have chosen those that have a low beta (ranges from 0 to 1), making them unperturbed to market vagaries.

The company delivered an earnings surprise of 2.04% in the last reported quarter.Let’s discuss the factors that are likely to be reflected in the upcoming quarterly results.Factors to ConsiderNiSource’s earnings are likely to have benefited from the new electric and gas rates that came into effect in the past 12 months.

471,ad999e51-eaab-3054-8276-136119ad08e8,NI,2023-04-28,MGE (MGEE) to Report Q1 Results: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mge-mgee-report-q1-results-140302146.html,1682604182,STORY,['NIMC'],"[The market expects MGE (MGEE) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis public utility holding company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.07 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +12.6%.Revenues are expected to be $212.9 million, up 1.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for MGE?For MGE, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.29%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that MGE will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that MGE would post earnings of $0.66 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.58, delivering a surprise of -12.12%.The company has not been able to beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.MGE doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerNiSource (NI), another stock in the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.77 for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +2.7%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $1.94 billion, up 3.3% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for NiSource has remained unchanged. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, reflecting an equal Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that NiSource will beat the consensus EPS estimate.

First-quarter GDP growth is widely expected to be moderate, while the index of future economic activity recently posted a record drop, indicating a forthcoming economic slump.The Leading Economic Index (LEI) of the Conference Board dropped to 108.4 in March from the revised reading of 109.7 in February and has registered the 12th monthly drop in a row. It’s also the lowest reading since November 2020, when the economy grappled with the outbreak of the coronavirus.From September 2022 to March 2023, the LEI fell by 4.5%, thereby signaling a recession for quite a long time. Justyna Zabinska-La Monica, Senior Manager, at the Conference Board, in reality, expects the U.S. economy to be in recession by mid-2023 (read more: 5 Top Stocks to Buy as Recession Fright Intensifies).Investment activities in businesses, meanwhile, are softening, thanks to stubbornly high inflation. Orders for durable goods have decreased in recent times, while spending took a beating due to the higher cost of capital. China’s reopening and solid first-quarter GDP growth are yet to uplift business sentiment in the United States.Being an interest-rate-sensitive sector, housing is also struggling at the moment. Home sales lessened over the past year, while construction activities decreased, indicating substantial pressure on the housing sector in the upcoming months. Let us also not forget that housing affordability remains at an all-time low.Amid all these, the banking crisis in the United States has increased worries about economic growth. The recent collapse of some of the regional banks has impacted credit growth, and in all likelihood, is expected to derail real GDP growth. What’s more, First Republic Banks’ recent declaration that its deposits decreased significantly in the first quarter reignited fears about the current health of the entire banking system.Story continuesThe United States, by the way, is already witnessing a freight recession, signaling a broader slowdown in economic growth. Fewer trucks are now delivering goods, leading to a significant decline in diesel prices.Given that the United States is worryingly close to an economic downturn, the stock market is now undoubtedly subjected to bouts of volatility. Hence, astute investors should place their bets on ultra-safe stocks that can counter such upheavals in the market and provide a steady stream of income.To select such stocks, we have chosen those that have a low beta (ranges from 0 to 1), making them unperturbed to market vagaries.

(NYSE: RMD, ASX: RMD) today announced results for its quarter ended March 31, 2023.Third Quarter 2023 HighlightsAll comparisons are to the prior year periodRevenue increased by 29% to $1,116.9 million; up 31% on a constant currency basisGross margin contracted 150 bps to 55.3%; non-GAAP gross margin contracted 200 bps to 56.1%Income from operations increased 28%; non-GAAP operating profit up 27%Operating cash flow of $282.6 millionDiluted earnings per share of $1.58; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.68“During the third quarter, we significantly ramped up production and delivery of our cloud-connected flow generator devices to meet ongoing high demand from customers, resulting in strong device sales growth across our global markets,” said Mick Farrell, ResMed’s CEO. “We now have full global availability of our connected AirSense 10 platform, while we continue to ramp production and availability across more geographies of our AirSense 11 platform. The bottom line is this: We can now support global customer demand for CPAP and APAP devices to serve the entire sleep device market. This is great news for physicians, providers, and especially for patients. We also saw very strong growth in our mask and patient interfaces businesses globally, demonstrating a sustainable focus on patient adherence and resupply. Our outside-hospital software-as-a-service business achieved high-single-digit growth organically and reached well into double-digit growth with a full quarter of contribution from our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition that we closed last November. We remain laser-focused on delivering lifesaving therapy solutions and accelerating the adoption of digital health in sleep apnea, COPD, insomnia, and out-of-hospital care. During the last 12 months, we improved over 156 million lives, and we are well on our way to our goal of helping 250 million people sleep better, breathe better, and live higher-quality lives with outside-hospital care in 2025.”Story continuesFinancial Results and Operating MetricsUnaudited; $ in millions, except for per share amounts Three Months Ended March 31,2023 March 31,2022 % Change ConstantCurrency (A)Revenue$1,116.9  $864.5  29% 31%Gross margin 55.3%  56.8% (3)  Non-GAAP gross margin (B) 56.1%  58.1% (4)  Selling, general, and administrative expenses 228.5   182.4  25  28 Research and development expenses 76.4   66.8  14  16 Income from operations 300.7   234.3  28   Non-GAAP income from operations (B) 321.2   253.0  27   Net income 232.5   179.0  30   Non-GAAP net income (B) 247.8   193.3  28   Diluted earnings per share$1.58  $1.22  30   Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (B)$1.68  $1.32  27    Nine Months Ended March 31,2023 March 31,2022 % Change ConstantCurrency (A)Revenue$3,100.9  $2,663.4  16% 20%Gross margin 56.1%  56.4% (1)  Non-GAAP gross margin (B) 56.8%  57.6% (1)  Selling, general, and administrative expenses 633.3   544.5  16  21 Research and development expenses 209.5   189.3  11  13 Income from operations 856.6   744.9  15   Non-GAAP income from operations (B) 917.5   801.3  15   Net income 667.9   584.4  14   Non-GAAP net income (B) 714.3   631.5  13   Diluted earnings per share$4.53  $3.97  14   Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (B)$4.85  $4.30  13   (A)In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we provide certain financial information on a “constant currency” basis, which is in addition to the actual financial information presented. In order to calculate our constant currency information, we translate the current period financial information using the foreign currency exchange rates that were in effect during the previous comparable period. However, constant currency measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to U.S. dollar measures that reflect current period exchange rates, or to other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.(B)See the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures in the table at the end of the press release.   Discussion of Third Quarter ResultsAll comparisons are to the prior year period unless otherwise notedRevenue grew by 31 percent on a constant currency basis, driven by increased demand for our sleep and respiratory care devices as well as reduced competitive supply.Revenue in the U.S., Canada, and Latin America, excluding Software-as-a-Service, grew by 32 percent, primarily due to the factors discussed above.Revenue in Europe, Asia, and other markets, excluding Software-as-a-Service, grew by 28 percent on a constant currency basis.Software-as-a-Service revenue increased by 35 percent, reflecting incremental revenue from our acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN and continued organic growth in our SaaS portfolio.Gross margin decreased by 150 basis points and non-GAAP gross margin decreased by 200 basis points, mainly due to unfavorable product mix and higher component costs, partially offset by an increase in average selling prices.Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased by 28 percent on a constant currency basis. SG&amp;A expenses improved to 20.5 percent of revenue in the quarter, compared with 21.1 percent in the same period of the prior year. These changes in SG&amp;A expenses were mainly due to increases in employee-related expenses and increases in travel expenses.Income from operations increased by 28 percent and non-GAAP income from operations increased by 27 percent.Net income for the quarter was $232.5 million and diluted earnings per share was $1.58. Non-GAAP net income increased by 28% to $247.8 million, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased by 27% to $1.68, predominantly attributable to strong sales, partially offset by gross margin contraction.Operating cash flow for the quarter was $282.6 million, compared to net income in the current quarter of $232.5 million and non-GAAP net income of $247.8 million. During the quarter we paid $64.6 million in dividends.Other Business and Operational HighlightsAnnounced the retirement of David Pendarvis, Chief Administrative Officer &amp; Global General Counsel, effective June 30, 2023.

ResMed uses non-GAAP information internally in planning, forecasting, and evaluating the results of operations in the current period and in comparing it to past periods.

The year over year growth in top and bottom lines reflected gains from continued market share growth and progress on its strategic initiatives. Moreover, TSCO benefited from its Life Out Here Strategy, Neighbor’s Club membership program and healthy demand for its products. Management retained its view for 2023.Tractor Supply’s earnings of $1.65 per share were flat year over year but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.69 and our estimate of $1.67.Net sales advanced 9.1% year over year to $3,299.2 million and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,302 million. However, sales beat our estimate of $3,294.4 million. . Sales in the first quarter benefited from contributions from the Orscheln Farm and Home acquisition concluded in October 2022, store openings and increased comparable store sales (comps).Comps improved 2.1%, led by growth in comparable average tickets, offset by a decline in comparable average transactions. The company’s comparable average ticket improved 2.8%, while the comparable average transaction count was down 0.7%. Sturdy demand for everyday merchandise, including consumable, usable and edible products, as well as year-round products, contributed to comp growth. This was partly offset by a decline in seasonal goods.Shares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 9.2% in the past three months against the industry’s 12.9% decline. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Costs and MarginsThe gross profit rose 10.7% year over year to $1,169.9 million, while the gross margin expanded 52 basis points (bps) to 35.5%. The execution of everyday low-price strategy, reduced transportation costs and other margin-driving initiatives aided margins, partly offset by cost inflation and the unfavorable product mix.Selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses, including depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of sales, expanded 119 bps year over year to 28.1%. In dollar terms, SG&amp;A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, rose 13.9% year over year to $925.5 million. Higher SG&amp;A expenses resulted from the deleverage due to moderate comps and higher depreciation and amortization, the opening of the new distribution center, and the impacts of the Orscheln Farm and Home acquisition.The operating income was nearly flat year over year at $244.4 million in the first quarter.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $7.76 billion.

The Oreo maker said it now expects full-year 2023 earnings to grow more than 10% on a constant currency basis, compared to its earlier projection of high-single digit growth.The company's net revenue rose to $9.20 billion in the first quarter from $7.76 billion a year earlier, while analysts on average had expected $8.48 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

Pricing and volume drove Organic Net Revenue growth.Gross profit increased $463 million, and gross profit margin decreased 80 basis points to 37.6 percent primarily driven by a decrease in Adjusted Gross Profit1 margin, partially offset by lapping prior-year incremental costs due to the war in Ukraine and favorable year-over-year change in mark-to-market impacts from derivatives. Adjusted Gross Profit increased $547 million at constant currency, while Adjusted Gross Profit margin decreased 170 basis points to 37.1 percent due to higher raw material and transportation costs, partially offset by pricing.Operating income increased $411 million and operating income margin was 16.4 percent, up 230 basis points primarily due to lapping prior-year incremental costs due to the war in Ukraine, lapping prior-year intangible asset impairment charges, lapping prior-year acquisition-related costs and favorable year-over-year change in mark-to-market gains/(losses) from currency and commodity hedging activities, partially offset by a decrease in Adjusted Operating Income margin, higher divestiture-related costs, higher acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments and higher remeasurement loss of net monetary position. Adjusted Operating Income increased $285 million at constant currency while Adjusted Operating Income margin decreased 60 basis points to 17.2 percent, with input cost inflation, partially offset by pricing and SG&amp;A leverage.Diluted EPS was $1.52, up 149.2 percent, primarily due to mark-to-market gain on marketable securities, gain on equity method investment transactions, lower incremental costs due to the war in Ukraine, an increase in Adjusted EPS and lapping a prior-year loss on debt extinguishment.Adjusted EPS was $0.89, up 17.3 percent on a constant currency basis primarily driven by strong operating gains, fewer shares outstanding and lower taxes, partially offset by higher interest expense.

The company's expectation for Adjusted EPS growth on a constant currency basis is now 10+ percent versus the prior outlook of high single digits. The company's Free Cash Flow outlook remains at $3.3+ billion.

accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). However, management believes that also presenting certain non-GAAP financial measures provides additional information to facilitate the comparison of the company’s historical operating results and trends in its underlying operating results, and provides additional transparency on how the company evaluates its business. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the company’s performance. The company also believes that presenting these measures allows investors to view its performance using the same measures that the company uses in evaluating its financial and business performance and trends.The company considers quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of its ongoing financial and business performance and trends. The adjustments generally fall within the following categories: acquisition &amp; divestiture activities, gains and losses on intangible asset sales and non-cash impairments, major program restructuring activities, constant currency and related adjustments, major program financing and hedging activities and other major items affecting comparability of operating results. See below for a description of adjustments to the company’s U.S. GAAP financial measures included herein.Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, the company’s non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.DEFINITIONS OF THE COMPANY’S NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESThe company’s non-GAAP financial measures and corresponding metrics reflect how the company evaluates its operating results currently and provide improved comparability of operating results. As new events or circumstances arise, these definitions could change. When these definitions change, the company provides the updated definitions and presents the related non-GAAP historical results on a comparable basis. When items no longer impact the company’s current or future presentation of non-GAAP operating results, the company removes these items from its non-GAAP definitions. In the first quarter of 2023, the company added to the non-GAAP definition for divestitures the inclusion of changes from equity method investment accounting to accounting for equity interests with readily determinable fair values (“marketable securities”). In addition, we added to the non-GAAP definitions the exclusion of gains or losses associated with marketable securities.“Organic Net Revenue” is defined as net revenues excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and currency rate fluctuations. The company also evaluates Organic Net Revenue growth from emerging markets and developed markets.“Adjusted Gross Profit” is defined as gross profit excluding the impacts of the Simplify to Grow Program; acquisition integration costs; the operating results of divestitures; mark-to-market impacts from commodity, forecasted currency and equity method investment transaction derivative contracts; inventory step-up charges; 2017 malware incident net recoveries; and incremental costs due to the war in Ukraine. The company also presents “Adjusted Gross Profit margin,” which is subject to the same adjustments as Adjusted Gross Profit. The company also evaluates growth in the company’s Adjusted Gross Profit on a constant currency basis.“Adjusted Operating Income” and “Adjusted Segment Operating Income” are defined as operating income (or segment operating income) excluding the impacts of the items listed in the Adjusted Gross Profit definition as well as gains or losses (including non-cash impairment charges) on goodwill and intangible assets; divestiture or acquisition gains or losses, divestiture-related costs, acquisition-related costs, and acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments; remeasurement of net monetary position; impacts from resolution of tax matters; the European commission legal matter; impact from pension participation changes; and costs associated with the JDE Peet's transaction. The company also presents “Adjusted Operating Income margin” and “Adjusted Segment Operating Income margin,” which are subject to the same adjustments as Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Segment Operating Income. The company also evaluates growth in the company’s Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Segment Operating Income on a constant currency basis.“Adjusted EPS” is defined as diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International from continuing operations excluding the impacts of the items listed in the Adjusted Operating Income definition, as well as losses on debt extinguishment and related expenses; gains or losses on interest rate swaps no longer designated as accounting cash flow hedges due to changed financing and hedging plans; net earnings from divestitures; mark-to-market unrealized gains or losses and realized gains or losses from marketable securities; initial impacts from enacted tax law changes; and gains or losses on equity method investment transactions. Similarly, within Adjusted EPS, the company’s equity method investment net earnings exclude its proportionate share of its investees’ significant operating and non-operating items. The tax impact of each of the items excluded from the company’s U.S GAAP results was computed based on the facts and tax assumptions associated with each item, and such impacts have also been excluded from Adjusted EPS. The company also evaluates growth in the company’s Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis.“Free Cash Flow” is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Free Cash Flow is the company’s primary measure used to monitor its cash flow performance.See the attached schedules for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures referred to above to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022. See Items Impacting Comparability of Operating Results below for more information about the items referenced in these definitions that specifically impacted the company’s results.SEGMENT OPERATING INCOMEThe company uses segment operating income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. The company believes it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze segment performance and trends. Segment operating income excludes unrealized gains and losses on hedging activities (which are a component of cost of sales), general corporate expenses (which are a component of selling, general and administrative expenses), amortization of intangibles, gains and losses on divestitures and acquisition-related costs (which are a component of selling, general and administrative expenses) in all periods presented. The company excludes these items from segment operating income in order to provide better transparency of its segment operating results. Furthermore, the company centrally manages benefit plan non-service income and interest and other expense, net. Accordingly, the company does not present these items by segment because they are excluded from the segment profitability measure that management reviews.ITEMS IMPACTING COMPARABILITY OF OPERATING RESULTSThe following information is provided to give qualitative and quantitative information related to items impacting comparability of operating results. The company identifies these based on how management views the company’s business; makes financial, operating and planning decisions; and evaluates the company’s ongoing performance. In addition, the company discloses the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on the company’s financial results in order to reflect results on a constant currency basis.Divestitures, Divestiture-related costs and Gains/(losses) on divestituresDivestitures include completed sales of businesses, exits of major product lines upon completion of a sale or licensing agreement. the partial or full sale of an equity method investment and changes from equity method investment accounting to accounting for marketable securities. As the company records its share of JDE Peet’s ongoing earnings on a one-quarter lag basis, any JDE Peet’s ownership reductions are reflected as divestitures within the company's non-GAAP results the following quarter. Divestiture-related costs, which includes costs incurred in relation to the preparation and completion (including one-time costs such as severance related to elimination of stranded costs) for the company's divestitures as defined above, also includes costs incurred associated with the company's publicly-announced processes to sell businesses.The company's Q1 2023 divestitures include the March 2, 2023 sale of KDP shares and the change from equity method investment accounting to accounting for marketable securities for the company's remaining equity interest in KDP. See the section on gains/losses on equity method investment transactions and marketable securities below for more information.On July 7, 2022, the company completed the sale of a business in Argentina including several local gum and candy brands and a manufacturing facility. In addition, the company's Kraft Heinz Company license agreement to produce and sell Kraft mayonnaise in Latin America countries, predominately Mexico, expired on September 1, 2022. The divestitures of these businesses resulted in a year-over-year reduction in net revenues of $9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2023. In addition, the company incurred divestiture-related costs of $1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2022.In 2022, the company announced its intention to divest the company's developed market gum and global Halls businesses and in Q4 2022, the company announced an agreement to sell the developed market gum business with an anticipated closing of Q4 2023, subject to relevant antitrust approvals and closing conditions. In addition, the company incurred divestiture-related costs of $30 million in the three months ended March 31, 2023.Acquisitions, Acquisition-related costs and Acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustmentsAcquisition-related costs, which includes transaction costs such as third party advisor, investment banking and legal fees, also includes one-time compensation expense related to the buyout of non-vested employee stock ownership plan shares and realized gains or losses from hedging activities associated with acquisition funds. Acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments include one-time costs related to the integration of acquisitions as well as any adjustments made to the fair market value of contingent compensation liabilities that have been previously booked for earn-outs related to acquisitions that do not relate to employee compensation expense. The company excludes these items to better facilitate comparisons of its underlying operating performance across periods.On November 1, 2022, the company acquired 100% of the equity of Grupo Bimbo's confectionery business, Ricolino, located primarily in Mexico. The acquisition of Ricolino builds on our continued prioritization of fast-growing snacking segments in key geographies. The acquisition added incremental net revenues of $171 million and operating income of $9 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023. In addition, the company incurred acquisition integration costs of $6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2023.On August 1, 2022, the company acquired 100% of the equity of Clif Bar &amp; Company (“Clif Bar”), a leading U.S. maker of nutritious energy bars with organic ingredients. The acquisition expands our global snacks bar business and complements our refrigerated snacking and performance nutrition bar portfolios. The acquisition added incremental net revenues of $218 million and operating income of $35 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023. In addition, the company incurred acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments of $39 million in the three months ended March 31, 2023. These acquisition integration costs include an increase to the contingent consideration liability due to changes to underlying assumptions.On January 3, 2022, the company acquired 100% of the equity of Chipita Global S.A. (“Chipita”), a leading croissants and baked snacks company in the Central and Eastern European markets. The acquisition of Chipita offers a strategic complement to the company's existing portfolio and advances its strategy to become the global leader in broader snacking. The company incurred acquisition-related costs of $21 million in the three months ended March 31, 2022. The company also incurred acquisition integration costs of $6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2023, and $35 million in the three months ended March 31, 2022.Simplify to Grow ProgramThe primary objective of the Simplify to Grow Program is to reduce the company’s operating cost structure in both its supply chain and overhead costs. The program covers severance as well as asset disposals and other manufacturing and procurement-related one-time costs.Restructuring costsThe company recorded restructuring charges of $30 million in the three months ended March 31, 2023 and $11 million in the three months ended March 31, 2022 This activity was recorded within asset impairment and exit costs and benefit plan non-service income. These charges were for severance and related costs, non-cash asset write-downs (including accelerated depreciation and asset impairments) and other adjustments, including any gains on sale of restructuring program assets.Implementation costsImplementation costs primarily relate to reorganizing the company’s operations and facilities in connection with its supply chain reinvention program and other identified productivity and cost saving initiatives. The costs include incremental expenses related to the closure of facilities, costs to terminate certain contracts and the simplification of the company’s information systems. The company recorded implementation costs of $5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2023 and $20 million in the three months ended March 31, 2022.Intangible asset impairment chargesDuring the first quarter of 2022, the company recorded a $78 million intangible asset impairment charge in AMEA related to one local biscuit brand sold in select markets in AMEA and Europe.Mark-to-market impacts from commodity and currency derivative contractsThe company excludes unrealized gains and losses (mark-to-market impacts) from outstanding commodity and forecasted currency and equity method investment transaction derivative contracts from its non-GAAP earnings measures. The mark-to-market impacts of commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivatives are excluded until such time that the related exposures impact the company's operating results. Since the company purchases commodity and forecasted currency transaction contracts to mitigate price volatility primarily for inventory requirements in future periods, the company makes this adjustment to remove the volatility of these future inventory purchases on current operating results to facilitate comparisons of its underlying operating performance across periods. The company excludes equity method investment derivative contract settlements as they represent protection of value for future divestitures. The company recorded net unrealized gains on commodity, forecasted currency and equity method transaction derivatives of $48 million in the three months March 31, 2023, and $28 million in the three months ended March 31, 2022.Remeasurement of net monetary positionThe company translates the results of operations of its subsidiaries from multiple currencies using average exchange rates during each period and translate balance sheet accounts using exchange rates at the end of each period. The company records currency translation adjustments as a component of equity (except for highly inflationary currencies) and realized exchange gains and losses on transactions in earnings.Highly inflationary accounting is triggered when a country’s three-year cumulative inflation rate exceeds 100%. It requires the remeasurement of financial statements of subsidiaries in the country, from the functional currency of the subsidiary to our U.S. dollar reporting currency, with currency remeasurement gains or losses recorded in earnings. At this time, within the company's consolidated entities, Argentina and Türkiye are accounted for as highly inflationary economies. For Argentina, the company recorded remeasurement losses of $11 million in the three months, months ended March 31, 2023 and $5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2022 related to the revaluation of the Argentinean peso denominated net monetary position over these periods. For Türkiye, the company recorded remeasurement loss of $1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2023 related to the revaluation of the Turkish lira denominated net monetary position over these periods. The company recorded these charges for Argentina and Türkiye within selling, general and administrative expenses.Impact from pension participation changesThe impact from pension participation changes represent the charges incurred when employee groups are withdrawn from multiemployer pension plans and other changes in employee group pension plan participation. The company excludes these charges from its non-GAAP results because those amounts do not reflect the company’s ongoing pension obligations.On July 11, 2019, the company received an undiscounted withdrawal liability assessment related to the company's completewithdrawal from the Bakery and Confectionery Union and Industry International Pension Fund totaling $526 million and requiring pro-rata monthly payments over 20 years. The company began making monthly payments during the third quarter of 2019. In connection with the discounted long-term liability, the company recorded accreted interest of $3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2023 and $3 million in the three months March 31, 2022 within interest and other expense, net. As of March 31, 2023, the remaining discounted withdrawal liability was $340 million, with $15 million recorded in other current liabilities and $325 million recorded in long-term other liabilities.Incremental costs due to the war in UkraineIn February 2022, Russia began a military invasion of Ukraine and the company closed its operations and facilities in Ukraine. In March 2022, the company's two Ukrainian manufacturing facilities in Trostyanets and Vyshhorod were significantly damaged. During the first quarter of 2022, the company evaluated and impaired these and other assets. The company recorded $143 million of total expenses ($145 million after-tax) incurred as a direct result of the war. The company reversed $22 million during the remainder of 2022 and $3 million during the first quarter of 2023 of previously recorded charges primarily as a result of higher than expected collection of trade receivables and inventory recoveries. The company continues to make targeted repairs on both our plants and have partially reopened and restarted limited production in both plants.Loss on debt extinguishment and related expensesOn March 18, 2022, the company completed a tender offer and redeemed long-term U.S. dollar denominated notes totaling $987 million. The company recorded a $129 million loss on debt extinguishment and related expenses within interest and other expense, net, consisting of $38 million paid in excess of carrying value of the debt and from recognizing unamortized discounts and deferred financing costs in earnings and $91 million in unamortized forward starting swap losses in earnings at the time of the debt extinguishment.Gains and losses on equity method investment transactions and marketable securitiesKeurig Dr Pepper transactionsOn March 2, 2023, the company sold approximately 30 million shares of Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (Nasdaq: ""KDP""), which reduced the company's ownership interest by 2.1%, from 5.3% to 3.2% of the total outstanding shares. The company received approximately $1.0 billion in proceeds and recorded a pre-tax gain of $493 million (or $366 million after tax) on this sale during the first quarter of 2023. This reduction in ownership, to below 5% of the outstanding shares of KDP, resulted in a change of accounting for the company's KDP investment, from equity method investment accounting to accounting for equity interests with readily determinable fair values (""marketable securities"") as the company no longer has significant influence over KDP. These marketable securities are measured at fair value based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1). On March 2, 2023, the date the company changed from equity method accounting for this investment, the company recorded unrealized gains for marketable securities of $755 million (or $562 million after tax). The company recorded an additional unrealized gain of $32 million (or $24 million after tax) during the first quarter, for a total unrealized gain of $787 million (or $586 million after tax) during the first quarter of 2023.Due to the change in accounting for the company's KDP investment, from equity method investment accounting to accounting as marketable securities, the company has treated the historical equity method earnings from both the shares sold and the remaining 3.2% ownership interest as a divestiture under the definitions of our non-GAAP financial measures. Therefore, the company has removed the equity method investment net earnings for KDP from its non-GAAP financial results for all historical periods presented to facilitate comparison of results.Equity method investee itemsWithin Adjusted EPS, the company’s equity method investment net earnings exclude its proportionate share of its equity method investees’ significant operating and non-operating items, such as acquisition and divestiture-related costs, restructuring program costs and initial impacts from enacted tax law changes.Constant currencyManagement evaluates the operating performance of the company and its international subsidiaries on a constant currency basis. The company determines its constant currency operating results by dividing or multiplying, as appropriate, the current period local currency operating results by the currency exchange rates used to translate the company’s financial statements in the comparable prior-year period to determine what the current-period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prior-year period.OUTLOOKThe company’s outlook for 2023 Organic Net Revenue growth, Adjusted EPS growth on a constant currency basis and Free Cash Flow are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude or otherwise adjust for items impacting comparability of financial results such as the impact of changes in currency exchange rates, restructuring activities, acquisitions and divestitures. The company is not able to reconcile its projected Organic Net Revenue growth to its projected reported net revenue growth for the full-year 2023 because the company is unable to predict during this period the impact from potential acquisitions or divestitures, as well as the impact of currency translation due to the unpredictability of future changes in currency exchange rates, which could be material as a significant portion of the company’s operations are outside the U.S. The company is not able to reconcile its projected Adjusted EPS growth on a constant currency basis to its projected reported diluted EPS growth for the full-year 2023 because the company is unable to predict during this period the timing of its restructuring program costs, mark-to-market impacts from commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivative contracts and impacts from potential acquisitions or divestitures as well as the impact of currency translation due to the unpredictability of future changes in currency exchange rates, which could be material as a significant portion of the company’s operations are outside the U.S. The company is not able to reconcile its projected Free Cash Flow to its projected net cash from operating activities for the full-year 2023 because the company is unable to predict during this period the timing and amount of capital expenditures impacting cash flow. Therefore, because of the uncertainty and variability of the nature and amount of future adjustments, which could be significant, the company is unable to provide a reconciliation of these measures without unreasonable effort.         Schedule 4aMondelēz International, Inc. and SubsidiariesReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP MeasuresNet Revenues(in millions of U.S.

The strong results stemmed from a well-performing Ambulatory Care segment, expanding patient volumes within the Hospital Operations segment and a moderated pace of contract labor costs. A hiked adjusted earnings per share (EPS) guidance for 2023 might have also instilled investors’ confidence in the stock. Tenet Healthcare reported first-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings of $1.42 per share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 22.4% and exceeded management’s expectations. However, the bottom line plunged 25.3% year over year.Net operating revenues of $5,021 million rose 5.8% year over year in the quarter under review and outperformed the management’s estimate. The top line beat the consensus mark by 4%.Q1 PerformanceAdjusted net income from continuing operations of Tenet Healthcare tumbled 26.7% year over year to $154 million and surpassed management’s expectations. Adjusted EBITDA of $832 million declined 6.3% year over year in the first quarter.Operating expenses increased 7.8% year over year to $4,471 million mainly due to increased salaries, wages and benefits coupled with higher supplies and other operating expenses. Also, the metric came higher than our estimate of $4,323.9 million.Tenet Healthcare Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Tenet Healthcare Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseTenet Healthcare Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Tenet Healthcare Corporation Quote Segmental DetailsHospital Operations and Other – The segment reported net operating revenues of $3,899 million in the quarter under review, up 2.7% year over year.

The metric suffered a blow due to declining COVID-related volume and acuity.Ambulatory Care - Net operating revenues advanced 22.6% year over year to $905 million, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $829 million and our estimate of $838.1 million. Solid same-facility net surgical case growth, buyouts, the inauguration of new facilities, service line growth and higher pricing yield contributed to the segment’s performance.Adjusted EBITDA climbed 20.6% year over year to $340 million in the first quarter and beat the consensus mark of $285 million. The metric received an impetus from prudent cost-curbing initiatives.Conifer – The segment’s net operating revenues of $324 million remained flat year over year in the quarter under review. However, the reported figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate as well as our estimate of $321 million.Adjusted EBITDA slid 5.4% year over year to $87 million but beat the consensus mark of $76 million. Earlier disclosed contract changes with Tenet Healthcare’s hospitals hurt the metric.Financial Position (as of Mar 31, 2023)Tenet Healthcare exited the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $766 million, which decreased 10.7% from the 2022-end figure. Total assets of $27,067 million dipped 0.3% from the figure at 2022 end.Long-term debt, net of the current portion, inched up marginally from the figure as of Dec 31, 2022, to $14,935 million. Short-term debt amounted to $148 million.THC had no outstanding borrowings under its $1.5 billion line of credit at the end of March-quarter.Total shareholders’ equity of $1,233 million rose 8% from the 2022-end level. In the reported quarter, Tenet Healthcare generated operating cash flows of $449 million, which nearly doubled year over year. Free cash flows were recorded at $214 million, which increased nearly three-fold year over year.Share Repurchase UpdateTHC bought back common shares worth $50 million in the first quarter. It has a leftover buyback capacity of $700 million that is set to expire by 2024-end.2Q23 GuidanceNet operating revenues are anticipated to lie within $4,800-$5,000 million.Adjusted EBITDA is estimated to lie between $765 million and $815 million.Adjusted net income from continuing operations is forecasted within $115-$140 million.Adjusted EPS is projected within $1.07-$1.30.2023 Guidance RevisedConcurrent with the first-quarter results, THC updated its 2023 guidance with respect to certain metrics.Net operating revenues are currently anticipated to lie between $19,800 million and $20,200 million in 2023, up from the previous outlook of $19,700-$20,100 million.

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Capital One: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Eric Salander, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.Eric SalanderThanks, Bradley, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I'd like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release. On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer.Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. Revenues in the quarter were $3 billion, up $23 million from last year's first quarter. Segment profit in the quarter was $259 million, down $18 million from the first quarter of 2022. During this year's first quarter, we reported net income of $0.92 per share. Adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, was $1.05 per share compared to $0.97 per share in last year's first quarter. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions, a non-GAAP measure, totaled $104 million in the quarter compared to $209 million in the first quarter of 2022. With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.Story continuesScott C. DonnellyThanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone. We had a solid first quarter. Revenue is up. Aviation, Industrial and Systems largely offset by lower revenues at Bell, consistent with our expectations. In Aviation, in the quarter, we delivered 35 jets, down from 39 last year and 34 commercial turboprops, up from 31 in last year's first quarter. Aviation continued to see solid demand across jet and turboprop products. Backlog grew $136 million, ending the first quarter at $6.5 billion. In the quarter, Aviation received an initial award on the U.S. Navy Multi-engine Training System contract for 10 King Air 260 aircraft and associated support equipment. This contract includes options for up to 64 aircraft with deliveries in 2024 through 2026. Textron Aviation's fleet utilization remained strong in the quarter, contributing to aftermarket revenue growth of 9% as compared to last year's first quarter. Moving to Bell. We announced the appointment of Lisa Atherton as the CEO, succeeding Mitch Snyder, who will retire at the end of April. Lisa returned to Bell in January after more than 5 years as the President and CEO of Textron Systems. She's done an outstanding job building strong teams at Bell and Textron Systems in her 16 years for the company and [building] confidence for our military customers. I want to thank Mitch for his leadership. During his tenure, he oversaw significant wins at Bell's military business, along with development of new technologies and product innovations. Earlier this month, the FLRAA contract protest was denied, and the U.S. Army subsequently canceled the stop-work order, allowing work on the contract to proceed. On the commercial side of Bell, we delivered 22 helicopters, down from 25 in last year's first quarter. During the quarter, we saw solid customer activity across all our commercial products and end markets, including order from the Polish National Police for 4 additional Bell 407s, which will expand their fleet to 7 aircraft. At Textron Systems, we saw a good margin performance on higher revenues across our programs. During the quarter, Systems' Aerosonde Hybrid Quad was among 5 competing unmanned aero systems that were down selected for increment to the Army's Future Tactical Unmanned Aircraft System competition. Also during the quarter, Systems delivered Craft 105 of the U.S. Navy Ship-to-Shore Connector program, the seventh Craft delivered to the Navy. There are now 2 Craft remaining to be delivered under the detailed design and construction contract. Moving to Industrial. We saw higher revenues in the quarter, driven by higher volume, both in Specialized Vehicles and Caltex. Specialized Vehicles, the Golf business continues to see strong demand and pricing for its ELiTE lithium product. At Caltex, we announced the first [Panatonic] order from an automotive OEM for a thermoplastic composite underbody battery protection in [Skid Plates]. Skid Plates is part of the company's new [Penatonic] battery system product line, supporting battery electric vehicle production.Moving to eAviation. During the quarter, we announced 2 new U.S. distribution partners on the East Coast to further expand [Episol's] existing distribution network. Also in the quarter, we finalized the group with Mesa Airlines for 25 Alpha trainer aircraft and an option for 75 additional aircraft. (inaudible) during the quarter, we displayed the Pipistrel Panthera and Bell's [Electro] aircraft, receiving significant customer interest in both models. With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank.Frank Thomas ConnorThank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Let's review how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron Aviation. Revenues at Textron Aviation of $1.1 billion were up $109 million from the first quarter of 2022, reflecting higher pricing of $58 million at higher volume of $51 million, which included higher defense and aftermarket volume. Segment profit was $125 million in the first quarter, up $15 million from a year ago, largely due to favorable pricing net of inflation of $17 million and the impact from the higher volume and mix, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from performance of $17 million. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $6.5 billion. Moving to Bell, revenues were $621 million, down $213 million from last year, as expected, on lower military revenues, reflecting lower spares and support volume in V-22 and H-1 production volume. Segment profit of $60 million was down $31 million from last year's first quarter, primarily reflecting lower volume and mix, partially offset by a favorable impact from performance of $29 million, reflecting lower research and development costs. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $4.6 billion. At Textron Systems, revenues were $306 million, up $33 million from last year's first quarter, largely reflecting higher volume. Segment profit of $34 million was up $6 million from a year ago, primarily due to a favorable impact from performance. Backlog in this segment ended the quarter at $2 billion. Industrial revenues were $932 million, up $94 million from last year's first quarter, largely due to higher volume and mix at both Textron Specialized Vehicles and Caltex. Segment profit of $41 million was up $2 million from the first quarter of 2022, primarily due to higher volume and mix and a favorable impact from pricing, net of inflation, principally in the Specialized Vehicles product line, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from performance. Textron eAviation segment revenues were $4 million, and segment loss was $9 million in the quarter, primarily reflecting research and development costs. Finance segment revenues were $12 million and profit was $8 million. Moving below segment profit, corporate expenses were $39 million, net interest expense was $17 million, LIFO inventory provision was $25 million, intangible asset amortization was $10 million, and the non-service component of pension and postretirement income were $59 million. In the quarter, we repurchased approximately 5.2 million shares, returning $377 million in cash to shareholders. To wrap up with guidance, we are reiterating our expected full-year adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $5 to $5.20. We also continue to expect full-year manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions of $900 million to $1 billion. That concludes our prepared remarks. So Bradley, we can open the line for questions. Bradley?Question and Answer SessionOperatorOf course. And our first question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.Sheila Karin KahyaogluI wanted to ask about Bell profitability. Frank, I think you mentioned some favorable performance in there. But with the FLRAA protest now cleared, how does this change the trajectory of Bell profit? And how are you thinking about the dilution, just given the development work? And just thinking about the bid overall, Textron's development value was nearly 2x [Lockheed]. So how do we think about this in terms of revenue contribution?Frank Thomas ConnorWell, I'd say that we had anticipated or we had planned basically for a delay in FLRAA when we gave our guidance. So FLRAA is going to roll in consistent with how we had seen Bell in terms of the $3.3 billion of revenue and [8.25%, 9.25%], not guidance. Obviously, we had margins above that for this quarter. So we do expect to be within that margin range that we had guided to. We do expect to see revenue growth. So we think this will be the low quarter for Bell from a revenue standpoint. So as FLRAA kicks in, we talked about that being a lower contribution margin. We'll see ultimately kind of where we get in terms of booking rates on that, but we'd expect volume growth with some margin headwinds associated with that revenue coming in. But overall, the team did a really nice job from a cost structure standpoint in this quarter, offsetting that decline in volume, and we feel good about kind of how Bell is positioned and the performance of the business.Sheila Karin KahyaogluAnd then just maybe, Scott, one for you. How do we think about Aviation pricing? I think you mentioned $58 million of gross price or 5%. Is that sort of what we should expect on the growth side? And how do we think about that as the dynamics of the market are changing?Scott C. DonnellyYes. I think so, Sheila. Look, I mean, obviously, the pricing is well built into the backlog. I think we are on track in terms of our expectations on costs. So I would continue to expect to see pricing net of inflation as a positive. Demand is still good in the marketplace. I think pricing is stable out there as we look out into the future bookings. So again, I think it's a reasonable expectation to think that we're going to continue to see price net of inflation as a positive, going forward.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein.Douglas Stuart HarnedWhen you look at the first quarter, and orders in Aviation, yesterday, we heard from General Dynamics that Gulfstream had some hiccups around the banking crisis that Silicon Valley Bank collapse that actually delayed a lot of decision-making in pushing orders through. How did you find that period at Aviation? Have you seen similar things there in terms of order flow?Scott C. DonnellyLook, I don't know that I would pin something specifically to Silicon Valley Bank, but I mean we had a positive -- greater than 1:1 book-to-bill in the quarter, which is good. We kind of guided to around a 1:1 book-to-bill. I think the lead time that we have right now in aircraft is in a pretty healthy place. And that's kind of what we're targeting. I guess I would say that any time you have financial disruption or adverse events out there in the economy in general, it's certainly easy for people to say, ""Hey, look, let me think about it or wait a little bit."" I think the good position we have right now is we have enough backlog out there that even if you have a quarter where you're down below 1:1, that's not the end of the world. If somebody defers out there for a few months, that's not a problem. That's the beauty of having a backlog. So unlike previous periods where you had some interruption and you'd see a delay, then that would hit you in terms of revenue and profit in the near term, I think we have sufficient backlog out there that even if you do have something where somebody waits a little bit, then that's fine.Douglas Stuart HarnedAnd then when you look forward, and you're talking about a book-to-bill in the order of 1 this year, when you look beyond that, if -- how do you think about the aftermarket? I mean, we might look at this as the aftermarket should grow somewhat proportionate to the fleet, but do you expect other factors to give you more growth there, such as more content per airplane or pricing?Scott C. DonnellyWell, look, I think it's a lot more around utilization, right? So flight hours is more closely correlated with the growth in the aftermarket as opposed to necessarily the fleet numbers. I mean, our fleet is so huge that even adding small numbers in any given quarter doesn't make any real impact. So it's primarily driven around utilization, and utilization in the fleet remains very high.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.Seth Michael SeifmanWe saw the share repurchase amount step up nicely in the quarter. I guess, can you talk about your thinking around that and maybe where you expect share repo to come in for the year? I guess you guys might have some additional cash coming in from a recent verdict. And so what your thoughts are on repos here and whether maybe it's time to step things up?Scott C. DonnellyWell, so I think what you did see us do was step things up here in the first quarter. We've always said that that's our primary return of capital, will be through share repurchase and do that opportunistically. We feel we've still been sort of in a good place to be buying. And so we stepped up $377 million in the quarter. Our cash flow in the company continues to be strong. We have a lot of cash on the balance sheet, as you guys know. And so I think consistent with what we guided at the beginning of the year, we expect to probably buy back somewhere in that 5% to 6% of the outstanding shares. So the first quarter was indicative of doing that. In terms of that, what's been out there in the media and the press around this intellectual property, verdict. Obviously, we're not going to comment much on that as it goes along through the legal process, but that's not something that we would expect to see cash come in any time in the near future. There's appeal processes, who knows how that's going to play out. So that doesn't factor into our thinking in terms of share repossession at this time.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen.Cai von RumohrNice results. So at Aviation, maybe give us some color in terms of relative trend you're seeing in supply chain? And also, what was the commercial bizjet book-to-bill because obviously, you also got some defense orders there in the quarter?Scott C. DonnellySo the supply chain side, Cai, is largely unchanged. I would say that kind of as we've talked about earlier, I think our labor position is in a much better place than it was. We did bring a lot of resources in, in the third and fourth quarter last year. Obviously, that does create some disruption, which, as you know, affects some of our conversion here as some of that inefficiency unwinds here in the first half of this year. But we're largely staffed at the levels where we want to be. So I would say on that front, things are certainly improved. But we continue to have suppliers -- have issues that are causing us to do things out of sequence and driving still some inefficiencies in how we operate the plant. So it's -- I'd say it's not getting worse, but it's not necessarily getting better. Sometimes it's frustrating. I think you get one kind of resolved and another supplier becomes a problem. And I -- we kind of expected that to be an ongoing issue through most of the balance of this year. So I don't think there's any big surprises there, but it's still a challenge. As far as order, look, our book-to-bill was greater than 1. We feel good about that. It's -- we don't break it out down to the individual models or programs, but certainly, we're -- I'd say we're happy with how the demand is going in both jets and turboprops. So I think we're in a pretty good place.Cai von RumohrOkay. And then a follow-up to Seth's question. 5.2 million shares is like 2.5%. So essentially, in 1 quarter, you've done half of your buyback target for the year. You won FLRAA, you had this bluebird of the DGI patent suit. What's the chance that basically the 5% to 6% is exceeded in terms of the repo?Scott C. DonnellyWell, I think, again, we're going to continue to press on this opportunistically, Cai. And we will see how it plays out through the balance of the year. But I mean, as you know, it's not really [formal] guidance. We just kind of indicated to you guys how we're thinking. And there's no change in how we're thinking it -- continuing to be our primary means of returning value to shareholders.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research.Robert Alan StallardFirst of all, Frank, you said you were holding the EPS and cash flow guidance for the year. Are there any changes in the divisional guidance for 2023?Frank Thomas ConnorNo, it's roughly in line with where we had been.Robert Alan StallardOkay. And then, Scott, one for you. Industrial double-digit growth in the quarter is pretty healthy performance. How sustainable do you think that is, g,iven the economic backdrop that we're seeing, particularly on your shorter-cycle products?Scott C. DonnellyWell, look, it's something to keep an eye on. I'd say that we're kind of roughly to the plan that we thought. I think you're -- we certainly expect to see and have seen softness in some of the short-cycle consumer side of things. But we're seeing strong performance still for, let's say, in some of the industrial and commercial applications. And when we look at our production allocations, for instance, we're certainly pushing some of our capacity and our volume to serve commercial, industrial applications more so than on some of the consumer side. So that's one where -- obviously, there's some uncertainty, we keep a close eye on it. But net of all those things, there's enough demand across all of the different markets that we serve to drive that kind of growth. And I think we'll continue to see that through the balance of the year.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays.David Egon StraussScott, bizjet deliveries in the quarter, were those a little lighter than you were anticipating? Just looking at how much inventory, I know you always built some inventory in Q1, but there was a pretty big inventory build in the quarter. So I don't know, if some deliveries, you missed some deliveries or kind of where you came in relative to what you were thinking?Scott C. DonnellyWell, David, I mean, for sure, but it's a couple of aircraft, right? I mean I think it's something is going to pressure us all year long. But we also factored in, in terms of our plans, what we thought we would see in terms of headwinds. So I don't think we're very disconnected from what we indicated in terms of the guide for the year.David Egon StraussOkay. Was that supply chain related, customer decision? What drove those delays?Scott C. DonnellyMost of the delays we're going to see through the course of the year are supply chain related, just getting parts and being able to get things sequenced and through test. We haven't seen any real change in customer behavior that's impacted anything.David Egon StraussOkay. And then I was wondering if you could maybe give a big-picture look, or how we should think about Bell, given all the various moving pieces, thinking beyond this year? Obviously, with FLRAA now in-house, H-1 [ending], V-22 rolling off, I think not sure what the outlook is for V-22 aftermarket. But how should we think about the growth profile for Bell thinking out over the next couple of years, given all these moving pieces?Scott C. DonnellySure. Well, look, I think, and Frank kind of indicated this as well, we certainly expect revenues to be increasing in Bell through the balance of the year and into next year as the FLRAA program is ramping up. So I think on the revenue growth side, we feel very good about that. Clearly, as we bring in a higher proportion of primarily cost, plus development effort, that's going to be at lower margins and those production program volumes on V-22 and H-1 that have been going down. So you do have that mix issue. That's kind of where that led us to the guide that we have out there this year, and I think that's kind of where we would expect to be as we go forward. So we're going to get this thing back into a growth mode, but it is going to be heavily weighted towards a cost-plus relatively lower margin piece of the business that's going to be offsetting lost revenue that's a higher margin. But I think it's going to stay as a healthy business, but it's certainly not going to be at the margin levels that we've seen in the past number of years.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Wolfe Research.Myles Alexander WaltonScott, in the last 12 months, I guess, or 18 months, last 2 additions to your Board of Directors where a couple of defense executives and Richard Ambrose and Tom Kennedy, and I'm curious if sort of the trend there is indicative of where you want to be taking the portfolio directionally more towards defense? And if so, is it indicative of the organics with FLRAA obviously being a contributor or more inorganic from an M&amp;A interest?Scott C. DonnellySure. Look, these are both guys who have, to your point, a lot of deep experience in the aerospace and defense world. Our company has always been sort of in that 30% defense with the growth that we're expecting to see in the Systems business, with the growth, obviously, we're expected to see in FLRAA and ongoing opportunities in the near future here, I think, of future opportunities in Bell and Systems. I felt like it made a lot of sense for us to beef up a little bit more on the [AD] side of the company. Both of these guys are recent retirees, they're current -- they know acquisition, they know defense, and they know aerospace technology. So I think they're two great ads to the Board. So there's no real super underlying message, but obviously, these are a couple of real high-quality individuals that know our space very well.Myles Alexander WaltonOkay. Very good. And there was just one 1 clarification, if I could. On the FLRAA disclosures from the protest, you talked about cost-plus-incentive portion and fixed-price incentive version. Can you just illuminate us on maybe where the fixed price risk you've taken on is and isn't?Scott C. DonnellyWell, I think there's two principal pieces of fixed price. One is kind of a program management and operation layer, which I think is low risk. We sort of understand what that is. And then as you guys know, there are several deliverables under this full program. There's the [EMD] phase, which has about 8 aircraft that are part of the development test -- limited-users test for the Army. And then there's [a Craft] that are sort of [outwent] the first initial production Craft, and the material that's in there is at fixed price. So -- but it's heavily weighted towards the cost plus.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.George D. ShapiroScott, the supply chain issues, I mean, led to an incremental margin of 14% in Aviation this quarter. That's the same that you had in the fourth quarter. The performance impact, $16 million, $17 million is similar. So do you expect that the rest of the year? Or can you overcome some of the supply chain issues that you had mentioned are going to continue?Scott C. DonnellySure, George. Look, I think it will abate in the back half of the year. As we talked about, a lot of those inefficiencies are things that were experienced in the back half of last year. A lot of that obviously goes through inventory. So that releases with the aircraft deliveries here in the first half of this year. Obviously, that anticipates that performance, and disruption will be less in the first half of this year than it was in the last half of last year. And I think, more or less, so far, we're seeing that. I think our factory is running better. That's largely, as I said, attributable to the fact that we've got the resources on board. There's still issues, turnover's higher than we would like. There's still more churn than historical. But certainly, the plant is running in a more efficient way. Now, supplier issues still pop up, as I said. But net of all that, I think that we will see better lower impacts of those efficiencies in the back half of the year than the first half of the year. So even with that 14%, which again is kind of where we expect it to be, I think for the total year, the overall conversion, which is sort of 24-or-so percent, which is appropriate for our business, it is still something we expect to realize for the total year.George D. ShapiroOkay. And then have you changed anything about deliveries expectations for the year?Scott C. DonnellyNot really. I think we're still tracking to what we guided.George D. ShapiroOkay. Thank you very much. Good report.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Baird.Peter J. ArmentScott, Frank, nice results. Scott, you've had a lot of questions on Aviation. I'll just ask one quick one. There's been a slight kind of increase in used aircraft out there. I'm sure it's -- in-production aircraft still remains very low. Just maybe any comments that you're watching or from your perspective on the used market?Scott C. DonnellySure, Peter. Look, obviously, we watch this very carefully. And you see numbers coming out, and they look like big percentages, of course, they are big percentages on very small numbers. So I think when we look at the used available, when you look at kind of that 0 to 10 years old, it's less than -- it's around a couple of tenths of a percent of our fleet. So it's a really, really small number. I mean, we're talking about 9 aircraft that we know of right now that are under 10 years old versus our fleet size of over 7,000 aircraft. So look, it's a trend of -- we see in the marketplace. But remember, these are -- on absolute basis, these are very small numbers, right? So the available-for-sale is less than a few percent, and about half of those are 20, 25-plus year old aircraft. So still a very, very positive environment in terms of used aircraft available for sale.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global.Peter John SkibitskiScott and Frank and Eric. A little bit of a follow-on to, I think it was Myles' question on FLRAA. Typically -- congrats, you get past the GEO review on FLRAA, big milestone there, but now you have to kind of switch to a keep-sold strategy, right? So I'm just wondering, Scott, from your perspective, what your view is on the technical and schedule risk to the development contract as you kind of move from the aircraft in your configuration to the exact production and configuration as the Army wants? I'm just wondering kind of, how you gauge the risks, and if there are any important milestones that we should be on the lookout for?Scott C. DonnellySure, Peter. Look, I think the way the Army has conducted this acquisition, and as you guys know, this goes back a decade, really, right, of both guys going through design, development, producing prototype aircraft, flying them, lots of soldier touch points, Army pilots flying them. As you know, as we went even through the formalities of the formal RFP and during this whole period of time, the proposal valuation, there was ongoing effort under the OTA for the CRR program, which was continuing to reduce risk and finalize design activities and risk reduction, even whilst the proposal evaluation was going on. And -- so I think the good news here is we have a really, really solid technical baseline for the aircraft itself. We have a great team that's in place, ready to go, that is being reassembled here to now go execute the EMD program. Obviously, there's a lot of new stuff here around the mission systems and development of that capability in the MOSA system for the -- it ensures architecture of the mission systems and how they accommodate changes over time. But I think that we have a really, really good technical baseline. The aircraft that we're about to go design and build and fly is very, very close to the aircraft that we've already designed and built and flown. So I think there's a big chunk of a risk that has been very effectively reduced, and we're ready to go get at it.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley.Kristine Tan LiwagScott, Frank, when you look at the portfolio today, it's clearly stronger this cycle versus the last. Aviation has got a backlog, Bell secured FLRAA, Industrials is stable now. With the balance sheet pretty low, what's your appetite to expand into another vertical and tap into secular growth markets?Scott C. DonnellyLook, I think that we -- as we've always said, we'll -- we keep an eye on things as things come to market or there's opportunities out there. But obviously, our plan is still built around organic growth. Investments in the businesses that we have, which I think we've been making substantial investments, and those are paying off for us in terms of what organic growth we're seeing. .And at this point, look, I think we do have a very strong balance sheet. We have a lot of cash on hand. We have strong cash generation in the business. We'll continue to execute on our buyback programs. If something came along that we thought made sense that was, frankly, in the A&amp;D space and was something that we knew could be accretive and a better value to our shareholders than just continuing share buyback, we would look at it. But as I said, it would have to be something where it's a clear win and always contrasting that with what's going on with our share buyback program.OperatorAnd with that, our last question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America.Ronald Jay EpsteinScott, could you kind of walk through -- you mentioned earlier on the call, is kind of back to Myles' question, about positioning the company for some more growth in defense and the opportunities ahead of you in Bell and Systems. If you could walk through a couple of those that maybe you find particularly interesting for the company.Scott C. DonnellySure. Well, Ron, I would say that the FLRAA win, on a stand-alone basis, is hugely important to our future. I think our guys have done a great job over the past decade in investing and positioning for that. .Obviously, as you know, the FLRAA program continues. It's a few years behind, the FLRAA program, but one where, again, I think our team has made the right investments. We've got the right people that have developed a product that I think is going to be a home run. As you know, we're all kind of waiting on the engine side to have that thing fly. But again, the Army activity continues in risk reduction and further [definitizing] that program. So clearly, I think that's a great opportunity. I think we have a great solution. There are activities, which, again, are publicly out there in terms of the future systems that the Navy and the Marine Corps are looking at, which I think a lot of our technology, particularly in the tilt rotor space, will potentially be a great solution and can leverage off a lot of the investment that we've already made on the 280 program. Those were likely to be adaptations. But again, from a technological standpoint, I think we're in a really good place for some of those future opportunities. High-speed VTOL at Bell, arguably a little bit further off, but that's another step. I think it further leverages our fundamental core capabilities to go to even higher speed, higher performing, longer-range assets. So I think Bell -- in my view, Ron, I guess I would say I think we have a phenomenal franchise around tiltrotor, and I think we have a lot of opportunities to continue to grow that franchise on a number of different adaptations of that technology into the future. On the Systems side, okay, that's -- there's a lot of programs in there. I think we've -- the win on the Sentinel program with Northrop is a driver of growth for us, going forward, as that moves ultimately from [A&amp;D] into its production phases here in the future. We have some great new wins on the [munition] side with [XM204s and XM250s], again a great franchise for us for a long time, which is really growing. I mentioned our down-selection FTUAS. Shadow continues to be a good program for us, but the future tactical UAS with the Army is certainly a big opportunity. There's a couple of big land vehicle programs, as you know, ARV on the Marine Corps side, OMFV on the Army side. So I mean, I don't want to -- to wrap up those stuff, but there's lots of opportunities out there for which we've either won or we've been down selected or I think we're certainly a viable competitor. [We're] not going to win all these things, but there's enough opportunity, and I think we're in good enough place that we can see a lot of organic growth being driven out of that business as well.Ronald Jay EpsteinGot you. And then maybe one follow-on, if I can. Maybe in the shorter term, are you seeing much demand being driven from the war in the Ukraine? Are you seeing orders for stuff that maybe 18 months ago, you wouldn't have expected better...Scott C. DonnellyNo, we're really not, Ron. We're not in that sort of munitions space. I mean there has been some dialogue around some land vehicles, but they're largely [EDA], things that are in surplus in the army that would come out being refurbished and put over there. There's some talk of different UAS systems. So there's some -- there are -- we've had nothing so far. And there's probably some, relatively speaking, smaller opportunities going forward, but it's not going to be a material impact to us.OperatorAnd with that, ladies and gentlemen, today's conference will be available for replay after 10 a.m. Eastern today through April 27, 2024.

508,cfbe45bb-9c21-39ad-a324-78612fe68cf3,KO,2023-04-28,25 Largest Beverage Companies in the Word in 2023,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/25-largest-beverage-companies-word-072323821.html,1682666603,STORY,"['KO', 'DEO', 'KDP', 'BF-B', 'STZ', 'PEP', 'MNST', 'ABEV', 'CABGY']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 25 largest beverage companies in the world in 2023. For more companies, head on over to 5 Largest Beverage Companies in the Word in 2023. These days, the biggest worry on everyone's mind is a potential recession in America. The economic turmoil that has been ravaging the world over the past couple of years has nearly destroyed the finances of developing countries and put advanced economies under strain as well. Take the example of China, where millions of fresh graduates with advanced degrees are struggling to find a job as the economy slowly starts after shutting down during the pandemic.At the same time, in the U.S. there is a growing worry of a potential default as the economy slows down in the wake of the Federal Reserve's rapid interest rate hikes to combat inflation. While members of the House were quick to pass a Republican sponsored bill in late April 2023 by voting two thirds to suspend normal rules, there are concerns that a showdown in Senate could very well place the U.S. on a default trajectory.But why bring up macroeconomics in a post about the biggest beverage companies in the world? Well, this is because the beverages sector is often quite resilient in a recessionary environment. Of course, the key word to note here is recession 'resistant' and not recession 'proof', since no industry is truly and absolutely immune to a drop in incomes and a slowdown in spending. Looking at what the professionals are saying, a study from Morningstar provides some important insights on this topic.In the aftermath of the 2008 economic crisis, Morningstar reported that the beverage industry was undervalued with an average value to fair price estimate of 0.88. It also highlighted that as spending fell, consumers became more price conscious which in turn saw the alcoholic beverages offered by Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) grow their sales. Additionally, other large companies such as Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) and Brown-Forman Corporation (NYSE:BF-B) were cash flow healthy. At the same time, brand loyalty also helped the beverage firms stay afloat, as Morningstar points out that brands such as Diageo's Johnnie Walker endured the recession well as customers continue to drink the spirit even as they canceled vacations.Story continuesAs a whole though, the beverages industry is made of both alcoholic and non-alcoholic products. In fact, the top five of the 16 Most Valuable Beverage Brands in the World are all non-alcoholic brands, and some of the biggest companies in the world such as The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) also make and sell non-alcoholic drinks. Naturally, since the current economic turmoil has been in place for over a year now, it's relevant to take a look at how well these companies are performing. On this front, Coca-Cola has recovered its revenue drop since the coronavirus pandemic and has grown top line sales since 2020. In fact, last year's inflationary wave also helped the beverage company, since it grew its revenue to $43 billion in 2022 from the $38.6 billion that it had raked in the previous year.Taking a look at the beverage industry as a whole, a research report from The Business Research Company estimates that the industry was worth $3.5 trillion last year, and despite the expected global slowdown, will grow to $3.7 trillion by the end of this year to mark a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.7%. It adds that from 2023 until 2027, the growth will decelerate a bit to sit at 5.4%, which will lead to a final value of $4.6 trillion for the global beverage market by the end of the forecast time period.Since it is one of the, if not the, biggest beverage companies in the world, a brief look at Coca-Cola's latest earnings call provides valuable details for what to expect from the beverages market. During the event, executives shared:Firstly, as John said, we feel confident about our outlook to drive the year [2023] from the top line. Let me connect that perhaps starting to 2022. As we commented, we saw steady volume growth through the year, including the fourth quarter. I know we reported a headline number of minus one. But if you accommodate the suspension of Russia and the COVID restrictions in China and take a three-year CAGR of volume growth, you see a pretty constant growth momentum through the year. And we would also comment that, that growth momentum has continued into the beginning of inflation. So we see strong underlying volume momentum or ongoing volume momentum that we have been able to achieve by our focus on the marketing innovation, the RGM and the execution to accommodate the need for affordability and premiumization in the phase inflation.And as John commented, we do see both inflation moderating as we go through 2023 and of course, our own pricing PMO beginning to moderate as we go through ’23 in part because, the input costs inflation is moderating, but also because we begin to cycle some of the price increases from 2022. And what that’s likely to net out as obviously, we’ve given a seven to eight for the full year. And what we’re likely to see is the beginning of the Q1, we’re likely to see revenue growth more close to what — the sort of levels we were achieving coming out of last year. And that then logically, the organic growth rate moderates as we get towards the end of the year, looking to close out on a more normalized level of revenue growth. And then when you average that out, you get to the seven to eight.se deWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the biggest beverage companies in the world, out of which the top players are The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Kweichow Moutai Co., Ltd. (SHA:600519.SS), and PepsiCo, Inc.

(NYSE: HI), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO), and Net Impact announced the 2023 winners of the Circular Plastics Case Competition. The Circular Plastics Case Competition was created with the goal of bringing together the next generation of innovators to rethink the challenges the plastics value chain faces from creation to collection.""Plastics remain indispensable to our economy and have a place in our future, so it is critical to remain focused on what can be done to advance sustainability within the plastics value chain. Because our equipment is used by the plastics and recycling industries, we can play an active role in being part of the solution,"" said Kim Ryan, President and CEO of Hillenbrand. ""With sustainability in mind, we created this competition to encourage the next generation to think outside the box and develop solutions that support a circular plastics economy. I am amazed by the innovation and ingenuity of the participants, and I am inspired to see so many individuals take action to help solve one of today's most pressing challenges.""In its inaugural year, the competition drew more than 50 submissions and contestants from 10 different countries across the globe, representing teams composed of undergraduate students, graduate students, and professionals. Participants were challenged to design solutions that would help keep plastics in the economy and out of the environment. Finalists presented their concept to industry leaders from Hillenbrand, The Coca-Cola Company, and The Recycling Partnership.The 2023 Circular Plastics Case Competition winners are:The First Place Team winning the $10,000 prize is Ashaya, an Indian-based startup that is turning post-consumer multi-layer plastic (MLP) typically found in packets of chips, into new products, starting with recycled sunglasses. The startup aims to increase the value of waste through technological and scientific innovations in recycling and then fairly redistribute that value to stakeholders in the supply chain, especially those who are the poorest: waste-pickers, their website states. Ashaya estimates that their lab has scaled to process more than 2,500 kilograms of plastic waste annually.The Second Place Team winning the $2,000 prize is the Tanzanian-based startup Vendify. Vendify uses solar-powered vending stations in rural Tanzania to offer in-demand consumer products such as cooking oil and liquid soap in exchange for the plastic waste that rural local waste-pickers collect from the environment. The active business estimates it will be able to divert more than 1,000 kilograms of plastic waste from landfills annually after scaling.The Third Place Team winning the $1,000 prize is Ecovend, an early-stage business concept conceived from a group of MBA students at ESADE Business School in Barcelona, Spain. The business model would employ vending machines in grocery stores across Spain to eliminate the unrecyclable toilet paper plastic packaging, diverting and estimated 47 million kilograms of plastic from going into the landfill every year.Story continues""We were delighted and proud to be able to join Hillenbrand and Net Impact in supporting this global initiative, as its goals closely align with our World Without Waste sustainable packaging ambitions,"" said Kurt Ritter, VP of Sustainability, The Coca-Cola Company North America. ""To address the challenges within the plastics value chain, it is crucial that we engage all stakeholders in the conversation, including and especially the young leaders in the communities we serve.""""The response we received to the Circular Plastics Case Competition in its first year was some of the highest interest our organization has ever seen,"" said Karen Johns, CEO, GOOD Institute, home to Net Impact. ""Our partnership with Hillenbrand and The Coca-Cola Company serves as a model for how businesses and non-profits can partner together to activate emerging leaders, engage the next generation, accelerate DEI, and create solutions for the betterment of society.""Hillenbrand plans to continue the partnership with Net Impact to spur innovation and interest in a circular economy with the next generation.

McDonald's (MCD) has hinted at a new digital enhancement that allows employees to know when a customer is nearby so they can begin prepping their food. Even execs from the big soft drink and snack makers — The Coca-Cola Co. (KO) and PepsiCo (PEP) — have weighed in. But the fast-fooders have been the real players. Here's a pocket guide to some innovations — and a few yellow flags as well:ChipotleIn a call with investors, CEO Brian Niccol said the fast-casual chain has discussed the idea of AI internally.""We've worked with a lot of our employees to identify what are the tasks that they would love to see us bring automation to, or AI, so that hopefully, the role can become less complicated...I think there's just other places in the back of the restaurant where we have the ability to automate, whether it's on the digital make-line or other tasks...""For instance, last fall Chipotle rolled out testing for a new kitchen management system to streamline operations, plus a new robot called Chippy that makes tortilla chips.Then, in an interview with Yahoo Finance on Wednesday, Chipotle CFO Jack Hartung said AI presents ""endless possibilities"" that it is exploring with its Cultivate Next fund. This new venture is intended to invest in ""forward-thinking ventures that are looking to drive meaningful change at scale [and] will help accelerate Chipotle's aggressive growth plans,"" per the release.Hartung warned, though, ""there's also a lot of pitfalls as well, so we want to be very careful, very thoughtful.""He added: ""Certainly, if there's ways we can make the job that our crews, do the jobs that our support staff do to support a restaurant easier, better and if the end result is we can run better restaurants and serve the customers in a better way, we're certainly going to look at any technology.""Story continuesFuture chips: Chippy, is an autonomous kitchen assistant that integrates culinary traditions with artificial intelligence to make tortilla chips.

You can skip our detailed analysis of value and dividend stocks and their performance in the past, and go directly to read 5 Value Stocks to Buy With High Dividend Yields. Value stocks trade at a price lower than their intrinsic or true value. These stocks are typically associated with companies that have solid fundamentals but are currently out of favor with investors, resulting in lower stock prices relative to their earnings, assets, and other metrics. Historically, growth stocks have beaten value stocks for the most part, however, value investment strategy has proven to be successful over the long term. Bank of America estimated that value investing has returned 1,344,600% since 1926, whereas growth stocks delivered a 626,000% return during the same period.The historical performance of value and growth stocks has varied over time, with periods of outperformance for each strategy. During years of high inflation, investors turn toward stocks with lower valuations and high dividend yields, which results in the solid performance of value stocks. Last year’s consistent interest rate hikes have given value equities their much-awaited comeback after underperforming growth securities for over a decade. According to a report by T. Rowe Price, the MSCI World Value Index outperformed its growth counterpart by over 20 percentage points last year. The report also mentioned that periods of high-interest rates create broader earnings growth in equity markets, resulting in a strong performance of value stocks.In one of our articles titled 11 Best Undervalued Dividend Stocks to Buy Now, we reported that value stocks surpassed growth equities by 18 percentage points in the first 10 months of 2022.Another report by Schroders revealed that periods of economic slowdown bode well for value stocks in the past. The asset management company gave a positive outlook on value investing and mentioned that value equities will outperform the broader market by 11.8% cumulatively over the next three years.Story continuesDividend stocks are also grabbing investors’ attention in addition to value stocks. Some of the best dividend stocks such as The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) are popular because these companies have rewarded shareholders with decades of dividend growth and have strong cash flows.13 Value Stocks to Buy With High Dividend YieldsImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur Methodology:For this list, we used the Finviz stock screener to identify dividend stocks with yields above 7%, as of April 26.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Our biggest dollar gainer within this period was Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had a material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies lead us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is mostly variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Value Stocks to Buy With High Dividend Yields.  Suggested articles:14 Best Income Stocks To Invest In10 Best Auto Parts Stocks to Buy Now10 Cheap AI Stocks to Buy in 2023Disclosure.

514,92d8d00b-b391-3671-8807-679a43642e10,MHK,2023-04-28,Mohawk Industries Reports Q1 Results,GlobeNewswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mohawk-industries-reports-q1-results-201000861.html,1682626200,STORY,['MHK'],"[Mohawk Industries, Inc.CALHOUN, Ga., April 27, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mohawk Industries, Inc. (NYSE: MHK) today announced first quarter 2023 net earnings of $80 million and diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.26. Adjusted net earnings were $112 million, and adjusted EPS was $1.75, excluding restructuring, acquisition and other charges. Net sales for the first quarter of 2023 were $2.8 billion, a decrease of 6.9% as reported and 5.9% on a constant currency and days basis. For the first quarter of 2022, net sales were $3.0 billion, net earnings were $245 million and EPS was $3.78. Adjusted net earnings were $246 million, and adjusted EPS was $3.78, excluding restructuring, acquisition and other charges.Commenting on Mohawk Industries’ first quarter performance, Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum, Chairman and CEO, stated, “All of our businesses are adapting our strategies to a more challenging environment. We are managing our costs while investing in both our short and long-term growth. We exceeded our earnings expectations with the business maintaining higher pricing and stronger mix, and Flooring Rest of the World outperforming the other segments. The commercial channel continued to be stronger than residential with home remodeling projects being postponed and new housing construction being impacted by higher mortgage rates. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we generated $129 million of free cash flow in the quarter.”We strategically invested in new product innovation, enhanced merchandising and customer trade shows to improve sales. We are continuing to reduce costs across the enterprise by enhancing productivity, streamlining processes and controlling administrative expenses. Our customers remained conservative with their inventory commitments, and our operations are running at lower utilization levels, creating higher costs from unabsorbed overhead. In Flooring North America and Flooring Rest of the World, our restructuring actions are on track and should improve the results of our business.Story continuesWe are limiting our capital investments to those providing significant sales, margin and process improvements. We are expanding our constrained categories that have the greatest growth potential when the economy improves, including LVT, premium laminate, quartz countertops, porcelain slabs and insulation products. We completed two ceramic acquisitions in Brazil and Mexico that had combined sales of approximately $425 million in 2022, almost doubling our existing market share. We are developing strategies to increase sales and beginning to consolidate the businesses to reduce cost, improve efficiencies and optimize production. We also continue to improve the small bolt-on acquisitions in Europe and the U.S. that we completed last year.Natural gas and electricity inflation remained a headwind in the first quarter, though our future results will benefit as lower energy costs flow through our P&amp;L. Our sustainability strategy includes investments in the production of green energy, which reduces both our expenses and carbon footprint. Our two biomass energy plants lowered our costs and improved our results in the quarter. We also purchased some of our European energy at various times to reduce future cost volatility. Italian energy subsidies have recently been extended at reduced levels through the second quarter of 2023.For the first quarter, the Global Ceramic Segment reported a 0.5% decline in net sales as reported, or a 1.2% decline on a constant currency and days basis. The Segment’s operating margin was 6.0% as reported, or 6.3% on an adjusted basis, as a result of favorable pricing and product mix and productivity gains, offset by inflation, lower volumes and temporary shutdowns. Our 2023 product launches with new sizes, unique visuals and polished finishes are benefiting our mix. We are reducing production to align with demand and competition in the marketplace is increasing. The U.S. is performing better than our other ceramic markets due to our greater sales in the commercial sector. Our more reliable U.S. domestic production is benefiting our sales, particularly in our premium collections that provide alternatives to European products. To increase our quartz countertop volume, we are expanding our business with national accounts, contractors and kitchen and bath retailers. In our European ceramic business, we maintained higher average selling prices than we anticipated, though our volumes decreased as residential remodeling slowed. Our other ceramic markets also declined with reduced spending on homes and greater reductions in customer inventories, though our sales trends in these regions seasonally improved as we progressed through the period.During the first quarter, our Flooring Rest of the World Segment’s net sales decreased by 9.7% as reported or 5.5% on a constant currency and days basis. The Segment’s operating margin was 9.5% as reported, or 12.6% on an adjusted basis, as a result of favorable pricing and product mix offset by inflation, lower volumes and temporary shutdowns. Our European businesses have been compressed as high energy prices and inflation impacted consumer budgets. Compared to the prior quarter, the Segment's business improved as we increased promotions to strengthen sales, had fewer shutdowns, lowered costs and expanded product options for more constrained consumer budgets. As input costs decline, we expect competitive pressures to increase in the market. Both laminate and LVT volumes were lower in the quarter, and we are controlling our costs and production levels in response. We have begun the conversion of our residential LVT from flexible to rigid and are preparing to restructure the operations. Our sheet vinyl volume increased as consumers sought options to lower remodeling costs. In our new Eastern European sheet vinyl acquisition, we are improving the product offering and enhancing the facility’s production and efficiencies. Our panels business has slowed with the market and inventory reductions in the channel. Our margins were higher than anticipated due to stronger pricing, lower input costs and benefits from our biomass energy production. We are making progress on achieving planned synergies in our French panels and German mezzanine flooring acquisitions. Our insulation category performed the best in the Segment as energy efficiency has become a greater priority, and our polyurethane products provide the greatest heat resistant properties. We have integrated our insulation acquisition in Ireland and the U.K., and our new facility is ramping up production ahead of schedule. In Australia and New Zealand, our results were reduced by higher interest rates and lower volumes. We are selectively introducing promotions to drive sales and have raised prices to offset cost inflation.In the first quarter, our Flooring North America Segment sales decreased 11.1%. The Segment had a negative operating margin of 0.2% as reported, or positive 0.5% on an adjusted basis, as a result of favorable pricing and product mix along with productivity gains, offset by inflation, reduced volumes, temporary shutdowns and incremental marketing investments. The Segment has been challenged by significant inflation, higher interest rates and more restrictive lending, which have weakened the housing market and our industry. As a result, our customers are more tightly managing their inventory levels, and we are aligning production with demand. Our margins should expand in the second quarter as our input costs improve and plant utilization increases. Our restructuring actions are on track and will lower our cost in the residential and commercial soft surface categories. Commercial sales remained solid with new construction and remodeling projects continuing in most channels. The commercial flooring accessories acquisition we completed last year has complemented our product offering and benefited our business. Sales of residential soft surfaces declined more than our other categories. The multifamily business remains the strongest category in residential, and we are expanding our participation in the channel. The U.S. LVT market is becoming more competitive as the industry slows and ocean freight costs decline. Imports from Asia are being interrupted as the U.S. requires proof of supply chain compliance as part of the forced labor protection act. Our West Coast LVT plant is continuing to ramp up and production will increase as we move through the year. Sheet vinyl sales are outperforming as consumers seek more budget-oriented options. During the quarter, our laminate sales in retail expanded with its increased acceptance as a waterproof alternative, though volumes in the other channels declined.Our industry is operating in a completely different environment than a year ago. Around the world, central banks are raising interest rates to slow their economies and reduce inflation. These actions lower our industry volume as new home sales and residential remodeling are postponed. The commercial sector has remained stronger than residential, though higher interest rates and tighter lending requirements could affect business investments as the year progresses. We are maximizing our sales and distribution by focusing on better performing channels, introducing differentiated products and providing enhanced service and value. We are proactively managing our spending and cost structures to optimize our results. We anticipate that industry volume and pricing will remain under pressure across our markets. We expect seasonal improvement in demand along with reduced energy and material costs to improve our future results. Given these factors, we anticipate our second quarter adjusted EPS to be between $2.56 and $2.66, excluding any restructuring, acquisition and other charges.This industry downturn is unique, with employment remaining high, businesses continuing to invest and homes maintaining their valuations. We are conservatively managing the near term while we invest in long-term growth through product innovation, capacity expansions and acquisitions. Our strong balance sheet enables us to navigate the current downturn as we prepare for the industry rebound that follows. Longer term, all of our regions require the updating of aging houses and significant new home construction to satisfy market needs. With our strength across regions, markets and products, we anticipate capturing increased opportunities when the recovery occurs in the housing market and the economy.ABOUT MOHAWK INDUSTRIESMohawk Industries is the leading global flooring manufacturer that creates products to enhance residential and commercial spaces around the world.

Items excluded from the Company’s non-GAAP revenue measures include: foreign currency transactions and translation.The Company excludes certain items from its non-GAAP profitability measures because these items may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, the Company's core operating performance. Items excluded from the Company's non-GAAP profitability measures include: restructuring, acquisition and integration-related and other costs, legal settlements, reserves and fees, net of insurance proceeds, impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, acquisition purchase accounting, including inventory step-up from purchase accounting, release of indemnification assets and the reversal of uncertain tax positions.]"

(NASDAQ:VRSN)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-opportunity-verisign-inc-nasdaq-115331116.html,1682682811,STORY,['VRSN'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established VeriSign, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSN). The company's stock saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Today I will analyse the most recent data on VeriSign’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for VeriSign What Is VeriSign Worth?VeriSign appears to be expensive according to my price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that VeriSign’s ratio of 33.58x is above its peer average of 21.16x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the IT industry. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Since VeriSign’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What does the future of VeriSign look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 35% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for VeriSign. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in VRSN’s positive outlook, with shares trading above industry price multiples. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe VRSN should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on VRSN for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for VRSN, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing VeriSign at this point in time. To help with this, we've discovered 3 warning signs (1 is potentially serious!) that you ought to be aware of before buying any shares in VeriSign.If you are no longer interested in VeriSign, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

James BidzosThank you, David. Good afternoon to everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to report another solid quarter of operational and financial performance for Verisign. We delivered these results while continuing to strengthen our critical internet infrastructure and complying with the high operational standards required by our ICANN agreements.For the first quarter, revenues grew 5.1% year-over-year, while EPS grew 19% year-over-year. At the end of March, the domain name base .com and .net totaled 174.8 million domain names with a year-over-year growth rate of 0.1%. During the first quarter, the domain name base increased by just over 1 million domain names.From a new registration perspective, the first quarter delivered a modest year-over-year increase with 10.3 million new registrations compared to 10.2 million last year and 9.7 million last quarter. Our renewal rates remain stable. We believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2023 will be approximately 75.6% compared to the 73.3% final renewal rate last quarter and 75.9% a year ago.Having seen modest improvement in the registration trend during Q1, we now expect a domain name base growth rate of between 0.5% and 2.25% for the full year of 2023. This updated range reflects the current macroeconomic uncertainty and recent trends in our business.Our financial and liquidity position remained stable with $1.015 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. Share repurchases during the first quarter totaled $220 million for 1.1 million shares. At quarter end, $639 million remained available and authorized under the current share repurchase program, which has no expiration.As many of you are aware, we are in the process of renewing the .net registry agreement with ICANN as the current term ends on June 30. Consistent with ICANN's usual process on April 13, ICANN posted the new .net registry agreement for public comment, which is open until May 25. The business terms of the agreement, such as pricing, the fees paid to ICANN, our renewal rights and the 6-year term of the agreement are all unchanged.Regarding .web. On Monday, ICANNs website published a notice of a scheduled Board of Directors meeting to take place this Sunday. One of the Board's agenda items is to further consider the .web IRP final declaration.ICANN then publish the minutes from 2 BAMC meetings, one held on January 31, which discussed the BAMC's consideration of certain recommendations related to web. And also the minutes from a meeting on March 2, which state that the BAMC approved recommendations related to .web and requested that those recommendations be sent to the Board. We believe that this new information published this week means progress towards a final resolution is being made, but beyond what was posted, we have no updates.And now I'd like to turn the call over to George. I will return when George has completed his financial report with closing remarks.George E. KilgussThanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended March 31, 2023, the company generated revenue of $364 million, up 5.1% from the same quarter of 2022 and delivered operating income of $241 million, an increase of 7.3% from the same quarter a year ago.Operating expense in Q1 totaled $123 million compared to $122 million a year earlier. Net income for the first quarter totaled $179 million compared to $158 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.70 for Q1 2023 compared to $1.43 for the same quarter of 2022.Operating cash flow for the first quarter of 2023 was $259 million and free cash flow was $253 million compared with $207 million and $200 million, respectively, for the first quarter of 2022.I'll now discuss our updated full year 2023 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.490 billion to $1.505 billion. This updated revenue range reflects our expectation that the domain name base growth rate will be between 0.5% and 2.25% as Jim mentioned earlier. Operating income is now expected to be between $990 million and $1.05 billion.Interest expense and nonoperating income net, which includes interest income estimates is still expected to be an expense of between $35 million to $45 million. Capital expenditures are still expected to be between $35 million to $45 million. And the GAAP effective tax rate is still expected to be between 22% and 25%.In summary, Verisign continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the first quarter of 2023, and we look forward to continuing to deliver on our mission as well as our objectives throughout the year.Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.D. James BidzosThank you, George. We strongly believe our strategic focus and disciplined management continue to serve us well, allowing us to deliver another solid quarter in which we provided secure and reliable infrastructure services, manage our business responsibly and efficiently and return value to our shareholders. I want to thank our teams for their dedication and focus.While there is some continuing turbulence in the economy due to macroeconomic and geopolitical issues, we see signs of stability and modest growth in our business. We're also pleased that there is progress on the resolution of .web.Thanks for your attention today. This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we'll open the call for your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Rob Oliver with Baird.Robert Cooney OliverJim, a lot on the call here. So I guess just to kind of level set at the outset, maybe you can give us a sense of kind of what you thought were kind of the biggest takeaways here for you guys? And then I had a few other questions.D. James BidzosOkay. Thanks, Rob. I know this may sound simple like I'm trivializing but what we do is anything but trivial. By the way, a wise man from Omaha said that just because something is simple doesn't mean it's easy to do, and to do it consistently and over a sustained period of time is even more difficult.So I mentioned in my remarks that what we accomplished in the quarter as we reliably and securely operated our infrastructure. We added another 3 months to a 25-year uptime record. That's really significant. We responsibly and efficiently run our business. That's always important. That's how we take care of our people. That's how we control expenses. That's how we focus on things that we can control. And number three, we return value to our shareholders. We certainly have obligations there.So this is what our customers want. They want reliable and secure operation of our infrastructure, of course, they want it to work. It needs to work. This is what our governing bodies, ICANN and the U.S. government want the contracts and the SLAs and the performance requirements make that clear. And we believe that this is what our shareholders want. So I guess that's what I mean when I say that this was a solid quarter for us. That's what we -- that's consistently what we strive for every quarter.And I would say that -- so those are the takeaways. I would just add that the fundamental drivers of our business are Internet adoption and reliance and that fundamental long-term trend line is strong. So another solid quarter.Robert Cooney OliverOkay. There's been so much -- and .web has been so long since we've had news. So I guess just trying to read into here what you told us about this meeting this coming Sunday. It sounds to me like that could be an indication that there's some decision would be rendered imminently here. Just curious to know if that's the way you think about it.D. James BidzosWell, you're right, Rob. It has been a long time, and we have always declined to speculate on ICANNs process. It is ICANN's process. So I won't speculate as to what the more may do. We're certainly pleased that there's been progress. This information about the meetings is good to see.I can add one thing, which is that when the ICANN Board, when it does pass resolutions and board meetings, ICANN typically publishes them on their website within 2 days. So if there are resolutions that come out of the Sunday meeting, they should be public by Tuesday.Robert Cooney OliverOkay. Really helpful. If I could squeeze in one. I appreciate it. I know I'm not the only one anymore, so I want to be conscious of that, which is great. Just around the macro -- I mean, you guys did tweak down the high end of the range a little bit. At the same time, Jim, you talked a little bit about the stability and kind of steady improvements, my language, not yours necessarily in the business.Can you talk about -- I think we've seen 13 the last 14 weeks or something with sequential improvement in domains. Can you talk about what you're seeing in the macro and specifically around how China reopening impacted you guys? And anything else relative to geographies that you would call out here?D. James BidzosWell, I don't know that I can point to any specifics that would give any indication. I can tell you that our general view is, first of all, the worst of COVID is certainly mostly behind us. And the long-term effects, the recovery, there's certainly still some turbulence associated with that recovery supply chain issues, et cetera.There's certainly some economic turbulence, interest rates were up. They're down a little. They're up again. Employment data is good, not so good. It's good. So that's the kind of turbulence we're referring to. That long term -- that long trend line is a strong one that we watch. But we are seeing what I would call some stability in our business.The fundamental value of the services that we provide, the utility of domain names is unchanged. And so I think we're just sort of going through that turbulence and it's affecting us. But we have seen an improvement, and we're happy with the quarter.OperatorWe'll take our last question from Ygal Arounian with Citi.Ygal ArounianAppreciate Rob saving some questions from me. Maybe I'll just start on just a follow-up on the macro and the domains. You guys gave the full year guide and you're raising the low end, you're lowering the high end.Can you just talk about how you -- how 1Q came in versus where your expectations were? Are trends stronger to start the year than you thought? And what are -- what needs to happen to get to the high end of the range versus the low end of the range in terms of demand registrations as we work our way through the year?George E. KilgussYgal, it's George. Sorry, a little echo there. But in any event, as Jim mentioned, we had modest gains here in Q1 with the domain name base growing about 1 million names here in the first quarter. When we look around our various regions. We did see the domain name base grow and pretty much all of our major regions with the exception of our China registrars, that segment was lower year-over-year.And when we look at our new units, we also saw some modest gains in new registrations, as Jim mentioned, year-over-year. The U.S. was a little bit tepid or flat here in Q1 relative to the prior year ago quarter. We did see some improvements in EMEA and the rest of the world, again, excluding China. China's new registrations were also lower year-over-year.And so as Rob alluded to, as you're acquiring, as far as China and the reopening, I would just say it's a little early days for us. We haven't yet seen any meaningful impact there, but we are keeping an eye out for it. And I think to the extent that, that reopening happens sooner than later. That clearly can help us get to the higher end of our domain name base range.Ygal ArounianSo I was just going to follow up on the renewal rates, which had a nice bump from 4Q and really the past couple of quarters so 1Q is there. Is that more typical seasonality in 1Q? Or are you seeing that kind of trend line improve from here in the past few quarters?George E. KilgussYes. So as you point out, renewal rates were relatively stable year-over-year, 75.6% versus the 75.9% in the first quarter. We did see an improvement from Q4. I'd said -- I say when you look at renewal rates in a big picture, our domestic renewal rates are relatively stable and where we see fluctuations is more in the international markets.And when we look a little deeper there, it's more in the first time renewal rates there with international markets. And so we've seen the improvement here sequentially year-over-year. And I think renewal rates are pretty stable right now where we see them.Ygal ArounianGot it. A, on the .web, I just want to see if you guys can expand on so I can't post this agreement for public comments until May 25, all the factors of the contracts are the same, nothing's really changing. What is the process from here to renewal? What is the public comment piece? What are things that might change or stand in the way? Or do you kind of expect it to just kind of work through pretty seamlessly?D. James BidzosWell, typically, in this process, comments will be collected, and ICANN will address the comments in response. So I think until we see that, I can't really totally answer your question. But the process of engaging with ICANN and coming up with a contract that was proposed negotiated and the proposed and put out for comment with its consistent features, as you point out. That part is done. And of course, the comment as you mentioned. So until it's done, and the comments are assessed and reported on by ICANN, then the next step concludes.Ygal ArounianOkay. And then I'll ask one more and then ask someone so I'll let him -- I'll take some for him, too. So on the .web, hopefully one step closer here, can you help us understand what happens, let's say, let's just assume that it goes through, and it's all said and done. What are the steps from there? What happens? How long does it take for -- to become meaningful or for .web registration to start opening up? Maybe just help us -- help them just think about the time line for what happens if we just assume that this part of the process finishes.D. James BidzosSure. I can give you some information that I think will be helpful to your question. One is that there are -- first of all, there is nothing in our 2023 guidance that we provided that includes any revenue or expense for .web. And I think I don't want to speculate about what's going to happen at the Board meeting Sunday, and I certainly don't want to speculate beyond that.But there are processes that are required to be followed. There are a number of things that have to be done. There are a number of security periods where certain things have to be done, and then there are some other trademark holder protection periods where they're exclusively allowed to come in and acquire their protected domain name.So there's certainly a number of cycles that are all roughly collectively, it's some number of months. But I think at this point, whenever anything happens, if it does, that there will be no change in what I just said about the revenue or expense in 2023.OperatorThis concludes today's question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to David Atchley for final comments.David AtchleyThank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening.OperatorThis concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.]"

This compares to earnings of $1.43 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3.66%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this internet infrastructure services provider would post earnings of $1.53 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.70, delivering a surprise of 11.11%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.VeriSign , which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Software and Services industry, posted revenues of $364.4 million for the quarter ended March 2023, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.83%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $346.9 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.VeriSign shares have added about 3.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 5.6%.What's Next for VeriSign?While VeriSign has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for VeriSign: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.67 on $372.06 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $6.74 on $1.5 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Internet - Software and Services is currently in the top 39% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.One other stock from the same industry, Sabre (SABR), is yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2023. The results are expected to be released on May 4.This provider of technology services to the travel industry is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.24 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +17.2%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Sabre's revenues are expected to be $727.68 million, up 24.4% from the year-ago quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 4. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis digital services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.25 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -3.9%.Revenues are expected to be $693.05 million, up 15.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Telus International?For Telus International, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.81%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Telus International will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Telus International would post earnings of $0.32 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.35, delivering a surprise of +9.38%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Telus International doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Technology Services industry, Trane Technologies (TT) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.33 per share for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +18.8%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $3.64 billion, up 8.3% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Trane Technologies has been revised 2.1% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.92%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that Trane Technologies will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

During the first quarter, approximately $350 million was reinvested in the business and $460 million was returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  Over the past twelve months, the company returned 107% of free cash flow(c) to shareholders.At its Capital Markets Day (CMD) in March, LyondellBasell launched a new strategy targeting net income of $6.3 billion and $10 billion of normalized EBITDA by 2027.  Prior to the CMD, the company announced several acquisitions and partnerships in line with its new strategy to meet the increasing need from customers and society for sustainable solutions.  In less than a year since signing its first power purchase agreement, LyondellBasell achieved 70% of its target to procure at least 50% of its global electricity from renewable sources by 2030.""We are rapidly advancing our strategy to create significant value by building a profitable Circular &amp; Low Carbon Solutions business and establishing LyondellBasell as the industry leader in sustainability,"" said Peter Vanacker, LyondellBasell Chief Executive Officer.OUTLOOKIn the near-term, the company expects typical seasonal trends to drive modest improvement in global demand.  Increased summer demand for transportation fuels should provide support for oxyfuels and refining margins.  Delays in the start of North American polyethylene capacity additions across the industry are expected to reduce new market supply and support polyethylene margins.  During the second quarter, LyondellBasell expects to operate Intermediates &amp; Derivatives assets at 80% and modestly increase global olefins and polyolefins operating rates to 85% to match the market outlook.  The company remains watchful for the effects of changes in global monetary policies and improving economic conditions in China on petrochemical markets during the second half of 2023.""LyondellBasell remains focused on delivering our strategy to grow and upgrade our core businesses, build a profitable Circular &amp; Low Carbon Solutions business and step up our performance and culture.  We believe the combination of these strategic moves will capture significant value by positioning LyondellBasell as the leading investment in our industry with a more profitable and sustainable growth engine,"" said Vanacker.(c)Free cash flow is net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures.CONFERENCE CALLLyondellBasell will host a conference call April 28 at 11 a.m. ET.  Participants on the call will include Chief Executive Officer Peter Vanacker, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Michael McMurray, Executive Vice President of Global Olefins and Polyolefins Ken Lane, Executive Vice President of Intermediates and Derivatives and Refining Kim Foley, Executive Vice President of Advanced Polymer Solutions Torkel Rhenman and Head of Investor Relations David Kinney.  For event access, the toll-free dial-in number is 1-877-407-8029, international dial-in number is 201-689-8029 or click the CallMe link.  The slides and webcast that accompany the call will be available at www.LyondellBasell.com/earnings.  A replay of the call will be available from 1:00 p.m. ET April 28 until May 28.  The replay toll-free dial-in numbers are 1-877-660-6853 and 201-612-7415.

Information contained in this release is unaudited and is subject to change.  We undertake no obligation to update the information presented herein except as required by law.INFORMATION RELATED TO FINANCIAL MEASURESThis release makes reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.We report our financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, but believe that certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as EBITDA, and EBITDA, net income and diluted EPS exclusive of identified items provide useful supplemental information to investors regarding the underlying business trends and performance of the company's ongoing operations and are useful for period-over-period comparisons of such operations.  Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.We calculate EBITDA as income from continuing operations plus interest expense (net), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, and depreciation and amortization.  EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to profit or operating profit for any period as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to operating cash flows as a measure of our liquidity.  We also present EBITDA, net income and diluted EPS exclusive of identified items.  Identified items include adjustments for ""lower of cost or market"" (""LCM""), impairment and refinery exit costs.  Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.  Cost is determined using the last-in, first-out (""LIFO"") inventory valuation methodology, which means that the most recently incurred costs are charged to cost of sales and inventories are valued at the earliest acquisition costs.  Fluctuation in the prices of crude oil, natural gas and correlated products from period to period may result in the recognition of charges to adjust the value of inventory to the lower of cost or market in periods of falling prices and the reversal of those charges in subsequent interim periods, within the same fiscal year as the charge, as market prices recover.  Property, plant and equipment are recorded at historical costs.  If it is determined that an asset or asset group's undiscounted future cash flows will not be sufficient to recover the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recognized to write the asset down to its estimated fair value. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit with goodwill is below its carrying amount.  If it is determined that the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized.  In April 2022 we announced our decision to cease operation of our Houston Refinery no later than the end of 2023.  In connection with exiting the refinery business, we began to incur costs primarily consisting of accelerated lease amortization costs, personnel related costs, accretion of asset retirement obligations and depreciation of asset retirement costs.Normalized EBITDA is EBITDA assuming portfolio normalizations including benefits associated with the following strategic initiatives:  Grow &amp; Upgrade the Core, Build a Profitable Circular &amp; Low Carbon Solutions Business and Step Up Performance &amp; Culture.  Portfolio normalizations reflect a 2022 year-end asset portfolio with 2013-2022 historical average margins and operating rates.Cash conversion and free cash flow are measures commonly used by investors to evaluate liquidity.  For purposes of this presentation, cash conversion equals net cash provided by operating activities divided by EBITDA excluding LCM and impairment.  Free cash flow means net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures.These non-GAAP financial measures as presented herein, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in the way the measures are calculated.  In addition, we include calculations for certain other financial measures to facilitate understanding.  This release contains time sensitive information that is accurate only as of the time hereof.  Information contained in this release is unaudited and subject to change.LyondellBasell undertakes no obligation to update the information presented herein except to the extent required by law.Additional operating and financial information may be found on our website at www.LyondellBasell.com/investorrelations.  These measures as presented herein, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in the way the measures are calculated. Table 2 -

(LYB), may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because LyondellBasell is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for LYB in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.84 per share for LYB, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.80 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for LYB, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of 1.99% heading into earnings season.LyondellBasell Industries N.V.

535,0321605d-228f-3921-9ff2-ff6765e976f3,LYB,2023-04-28,4 Chemical Stocks Poised to Outshine Q1 Earnings Estimates,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-chemical-stocks-poised-outshine-104210077.html,1682592130,STORY,"['ALB', 'LYB', 'AXTA', 'DD']","[Chemical companies are expected to have benefited from firm demand across several end-use markets and the benefits of pricing and cost actions to counter continued headwinds from raw material, energy and logistics cost inflation. However, softness in certain markets, including consumer durables and building &amp; construction, and some lingering impacts of customer inventory destocking are likely to have posed as headwinds.The companies in this space that have reported March-quarter results so far have witnessed volume pressure from demand slowdown resulting from weaker global economic activities and the downturn in Europe amid lingering headwinds from input and energy cost inflation. A number of chemical companies are yet to report their quarterly numbers, including Albemarle Corporation ALB, DuPont de Nemours, Inc. DD, Axalta Coating Systems Ltd. AXTA and LyondellBasell Industries N.V. LYB.How Have Things Shaped Up for These Companies?Chemical companies’ first-quarter results are expected to reflect stable demand in several markets and pricing actions. Demand for chemicals in the automotive market remains healthy, further aided by a recovery in automotive production on improved supply of semiconductors. Moreover, demand in packaging and healthcare remains strong. The companies in this space are also seeing a recovery in demand across the aerospace and energy markets. A rebound in drilling activities on the back of an uptick in oil prices has led to the demand recovery in the energy space. However, the slowdown in the building &amp; construction and consumer durables markets is likely to have played spoilsport.  Chemical companies are also expected to have faced margin pressure, resulting from elevated raw material costs. Supply-chain disruptions have led to a spike in raw material costs. The Russia-Ukraine conflict and new lockdowns in China following a resurgence in COVID-19 infections have put further pressure on the global supply chain. Higher energy and gas prices, especially in Europe due to the war in Ukraine, have also pushed up the production costs of chemicals and affected demand in that region. The lingering impacts of these headwinds are likely to reflect on the chemical companies’ first-quarter performance. Unfavorable currency swings driven by a stronger dollar are also likely to have been a drag on their performance.Nevertheless, the benefits of self-help actions, including actions to raise the selling prices of chemical products to counter the cost inflation and tightness in the supply chain, productivity improvement measures and operational efficiency improvement, might reflect on the results of the companies in this space.Story continuesExpectations for Q1The chemical industry is housed within the broader Zacks Basic Materials sector. Basic Materials is among the sectors that are expected to witness a decline in earnings on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter. Overall earnings for the sector are projected to decline 36.1% on 10.4% lower revenues, per the latest Earnings Trends report.How to Pick Winners?Given the large number of players operating in the chemical space, picking the right stocks is apparently not an easy task. But our proprietary methodology makes it fairly simple. One can trim the list with the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank — Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — and a positive Zacks Earnings ESP. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they report with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP — the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate — is our proprietary methodology for determining stocks that have high chances of delivering earnings surprises in their next announcements. Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as much as 70%.Our ChoicesBelow, we list four chemical stocks that have the right combination of elements to pull off an earnings surprise this time around:Albemarle has an Earnings ESP of +0.80% and carries a Zacks Rank #3. The company is scheduled to report on May 3.Albemarle surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 15.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at $6.93, indicating a rise of 191.2% from the prior-year quarter. ALB is likely to have benefited from higher volumes in its lithium business on higher customer demand. Higher lithium prices are also likely to have supported its performance. Its cost-saving and productivity initiatives are also expected to have supported margins. Albemarle Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Albemarle Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseAlbemarle Corporation price-eps-surprise | Albemarle Corporation Quote DuPont has an Earnings ESP of +1.77% and a Zacks Rank #3. It is slated to report on May 2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.DuPont surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of roughly 13.8%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings stands at 81 cents. DD is expected to have gained from healthy underlying demand in a number of end markets, including water and general industrial. Actions to implement strategic price increases in the wake of raw material and energy cost inflation are also likely to have aided its margins. Benefits from innovation and cost synergy savings as well as productivity improvement actions are also expected to reflect on its performance. DuPont de Nemours, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise DuPont de Nemours, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseDuPont de Nemours, Inc. price-eps-surprise | DuPont de Nemours, Inc. QuoteAxalta Coating Systems has an Earnings ESP of +4.35% and a Zacks Rank #3. It is scheduled to report on May 2.Axalta surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and delivered in-line results on the other occasion. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of roughly 6.8%, on average. The consensus estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at 31 cents. AXTA is expected to have benefited from higher average price and improved volumes. The results in its Performance Coatings segment are likely to have been aided by price and product mix benefits. Continued momentum in refinish is expected to have offset weakness in industrial markets. Mobility Coatings sales are also likely to have been driven by a recovery in global automotive production and strong pricing. Axalta Coating Systems Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise Axalta Coating Systems Ltd. Price and EPS SurpriseAxalta Coating Systems Ltd. price-eps-surprise | Axalta Coating Systems Ltd.

The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of roughly 1%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings stands at $1.80. LYB’s first-quarter results are likely to reflect the benefits of moderate levels of energy and feedstock prices. It is expected to have witnessed stable demand from consumer packaging, oxyfuels and refining markets. Oxyfuel margins are expected to have remained strong in the first quarter on lower feedstock costs. LyondellBasell Industries N.V. Price and EPS Surprise LyondellBasell Industries N.V.

536,a8e19409-bf6d-367d-9e95-85f14dca7f1d,VMC,2023-04-28,Analysts Estimate Vulcan Materials (VMC) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-vulcan-materials-vmc-140202538.html,1682604122,STORY,['VMC'],"[The market expects Vulcan Materials (VMC) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 4, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis construction materials company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.64 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -12.3%.Revenues are expected to be $1.58 billion, up 2.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.7% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Vulcan?For Vulcan, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -29.20%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Vulcan will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Vulcan would post earnings of $1.29 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.08, delivering a surprise of -16.28%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Vulcan doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Pretax investment income rose 14% driven primarily by higher interest income from our bond portfolio. Consolidated operating income was $141 million or $0.89 per share compared with $260 million or $1.62 per share in last year's first quarter.""Turning to our insurance operations, our first-quarter 2023 combined ratio of 100.7% included 12.8 percentage points related to natural catastrophe losses, more than double our five-year historical first-quarter average.""The increase in weather-related catastrophes masked the steady improvements we are making to our underlying business. Before catastrophe loss effects, our property casualty combined ratio improved by 0.2 points to 87.9% compared with last year's first quarter. The current accident year combined ratio before catastrophe loss effects also improved, lowering 0.1 points to 90.1% compared with full-year 2022.""We continued to build on our record of 34 consecutive years of overall favorable reserve development with first-quarter net favorable reserve development on prior accident years up 0.7 points compared with first-quarter 2022.""Maintaining Underwriting Discipline""We're pleased with the premium increases reported by each of our property casualty segments. Consolidated property casualty first-quarter net written premiums grew 6%, including higher average pricing than the fourth quarter of 2022. Commercial lines pricing rose on average at percentages near the high end of the mid-single-digit range. Excess and surplus lines pricing rose on average at a high-single-digit percentage rate, while personal lines improved to average mid-single-digit percentage rate increases. Ongoing efforts to segment policies should also help improve profitability, as we seek more adequate pricing on individual policies based on their specific characteristics.""The main driver for our growth continues to come from the excellent relationships we develop and nurture with our agencies. To keep the momentum going, we continue to look for opportunities to appoint new agents while still delivering the superior service that our agents value. So far this year, we've appointed 66 agencies that sell most or all of our property casualty products.""Our diversified product portfolio also supports our ability to grow profitably.

Statutory data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules for insurance company regulation in the United States of America as defined by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' (NAIC) Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual, and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP data.Management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate its primary business areas – property casualty insurance, life insurance and investments. Management uses these measures when analyzing both GAAP and non-GAAP results to improve its understanding of trends in the underlying business and to help avoid incorrect or misleading assumptions and conclusions about the success or failure of company strategies. Management adjustments to GAAP measures generally: apply to non-recurring events that are unrelated to business performance and distort short-term results; involve values that fluctuate based on events outside of management's control; supplement reporting segment disclosures with disclosures for a subsidiary company or for a combination of subsidiaries or reporting segments; or relate to accounting refinements that affect comparability between periods, creating a need to analyze data on the same basis.Non-GAAP operating income: Non-GAAP operating income is calculated by excluding investment gains and losses (defined as investment gains and losses after applicable federal and state income taxes) and other significant non-recurring items from net income. Management evaluates non-GAAP operating income to measure the success of pricing, rate and underwriting strategies. While investment gains (or losses) are integral to the company's insurance operations over the long term, the determination to realize investment gains or losses on fixed-maturity securities sold in any period may be subject to management's discretion and is independent of the insurance underwriting process. Also, under applicable GAAP accounting requirements, gains and losses are recognized from certain changes in market values of securities without actual realization. Management believes that the level of investment gains or losses for any particular period, while it may be material, may not fully indicate the performance of ongoing underlying business operations in that period.For these reasons, many investors and shareholders consider non-GAAP operating income to be one of the more meaningful measures for evaluating insurance company performance. Equity analysts who report on the insurance industry and the company generally focus on this metric in their analyses. The company presents non-GAAP operating income so that all investors have what management believes to be a useful supplement to GAAP information.Consolidated property casualty insurance results: To supplement reporting segment disclosures related to our property casualty insurance operations, we also evaluate results for those operations on a basis that includes results for our property casualty insurance and brokerage services subsidiaries. That is the total of our commercial lines, personal lines and our excess and surplus lines segments plus our reinsurance assumed operations known as Cincinnati Re and our London-based global specialty underwriter known as Cincinnati Global.Life insurance subsidiary results: To supplement life insurance reporting segment disclosures related to our life insurance operation, we also evaluate results for that operation on a basis that includes life insurance subsidiary investment income, or investment income plus investment gains and losses, that are also included in our investments reporting segment. We recognize that assets under management, capital appreciation and investment income are integral to evaluating the success of the life insurance segment because of the long duration of life products.Cincinnati Financial Corporation  Net Income Reconciliation(Dollars in millions, except per share data)Three months ended March 31,20232022Net income (loss)$ 225$ (266)Less: Investment gains and losses, net106(666) Income tax on investment gains and losses (22)140 Investment gains and losses, after-tax84(526)Non-GAAP operating income$ 141$ 260Diluted per share data:Net income (loss)$ 1.42$ (1.66)Less: Investment gains and losses, net0.67(4.15) Income tax on investment gains and losses (0.14)0.87 Investment gains and losses, after-tax0.53(3.28) Non-GAAP operating income$ 0.89$ 1.62Life Insurance Reconciliation(Dollars in millions)Three months ended March 31,20232022Net income of the life insurance subsidiary$ 19$ 17Investment gains and losses, net 1—Income tax on investment gains and losses——Non-GAAP operating income1817Investment income, net of expenses (45)(42)Investment income credited to contract holders3027Income tax excluding tax on investment gains and losses, net55Life insurance segment profit$ 8$ 7 Property Casualty Insurance Reconciliation(Dollars in millions)Three months ended March 31, 2023ConsolidatedCommercialPersonalE&amp;SOther*Premiums: Written premiums$ 2,019$ 1,141$ 448$ 136$ 294 Unearned premiums change(178)(85)16(9)(100) Earned premiums$ 1,841$ 1,056$ 464$ 127$ 194Underwriting profit (loss)$ (10)$ (2)$ (57)$ 13$ 36(Dollars in millions)Three months ended March 31, 2022ConsolidatedCommercialPersonalE&amp;SOther*Premiums: Written premiums$ 1,899$ 1,096$ 374$ 124$ 305 Unearned premiums change(281)(134)28(12)(163) Earned premiums$ 1,618$ 962$ 402$ 112$ 142Underwriting profit $ 165$ 76$ 65$ 16$ 8 Dollar amounts shown are rounded to millions; certain amounts may not add due to rounding. *Included in Other are the results of Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global.Cincinnati Financial CorporationOther MeasuresValue creation ratio: This is a measure of shareholder value creation that management believes captures the contribution of the company's insurance operations, the success of its investment strategy and the importance placed on paying cash dividends to shareholders. The value creation ratio measure is made up of two primary components: (1) rate of growth in book value per share plus (2) the ratio of dividends declared per share to beginning book value per share. Management believes this measure is useful, providing a meaningful measure of long-term progress in creating shareholder value. It is intended to be all-inclusive regarding changes in book value per share, and uses originally reported book value per share in cases where book value per share has been adjusted, such as adoption of Accounting Standards Updates with a cumulative effect of a change in accounting.Written premium: Under statutory accounting rules in the U.S., property casualty written premium is the amount recorded for policies issued and recognized on an annualized basis at the effective date of the policy.

Statutory data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules for insurance company regulation in the United States of America as defined by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' (NAIC) Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual, and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP data.Management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate its primary business areas – property casualty insurance, life insurance and investments. Management uses these measures when analyzing both GAAP and non-GAAP results to improve its understanding of trends in the underlying business and to help avoid incorrect or misleading assumptions and conclusions about the success or failure of company strategies. Management adjustments to GAAP measures generally: apply to non-recurring events that are unrelated to business performance and distort short-term results; involve values that fluctuate based on events outside of management's control; supplement reporting segment disclosures with disclosures for a subsidiary company or for a combination of subsidiaries or reporting segments; or relate to accounting refinements that affect comparability between periods, creating a need to analyze data on the same basis.Non-GAAP operating income: Non-GAAP operating income is calculated by excluding investment gains and losses (defined as investment gains and losses after applicable federal and state income taxes) and other significant non-recurring items from net income. Management evaluates non-GAAP operating income to measure the success of pricing, rate and underwriting strategies. While investment gains (or losses) are integral to the company's insurance operations over the long term, the determination to realize investment gains or losses on fixed-maturity securities sold in any period may be subject to management's discretion and is independent of the insurance underwriting process. Also, under applicable GAAP accounting requirements, gains and losses are recognized from certain changes in market values of securities without actual realization. Management believes that the level of investment gains or losses for any particular period, while it may be material, may not fully indicate the performance of ongoing underlying business operations in that period.For these reasons, many investors and shareholders consider non-GAAP operating income to be one of the more meaningful measures for evaluating insurance company performance. Equity analysts who report on the insurance industry and the company generally focus on this metric in their analyses. The company presents non-GAAP operating income so that all investors have what management believes to be a useful supplement to GAAP information.Consolidated property casualty insurance results: To supplement reporting segment disclosures related to our property casualty insurance operations, we also evaluate results for those operations on a basis that includes results for our property casualty insurance and brokerage services subsidiaries. That is the total of our commercial lines, personal lines and our excess and surplus lines segments plus our reinsurance assumed operations known as Cincinnati Re and our London-based global specialty underwriter known as Cincinnati Global.Life insurance subsidiary results: To supplement life insurance reporting segment disclosures related to our life insurance operation, we also evaluate results for that operation on a basis that includes life insurance subsidiary investment income, or investment income plus investment gains and losses, that are also included in our investments reporting segment. We recognize that assets under management, capital appreciation and investment income are integral to evaluating the success of the life insurance segment because of the long duration of life products.Cincinnati Financial Corporation  Net Income Reconciliation(Dollars in millions, except per share data)Three months ended March 31,20232022Net income (loss)$                    225$                  (266)Less:   Investment gains and losses, net106(666)   Income tax on investment gains and losses (22)140   Investment gains and losses, after-tax84(526)Non-GAAP operating income$                    141$                    260Diluted per share data:Net income (loss)$                   1.42$                 (1.66)Less:   Investment gains and losses, net0.67(4.15)   Income tax on investment gains and losses (0.14)0.87   Investment gains and losses, after-tax0.53(3.28)   Non-GAAP operating income$                   0.89$                   1.62Life Insurance Reconciliation(Dollars in millions)Three months ended March 31,20232022Net income of the life insurance subsidiary$                      19$                      17Investment gains and losses, net 1—Income tax on investment gains and losses——Non-GAAP operating income1817Investment income, net of expenses (45)(42)Investment income credited to contract holders3027Income tax excluding tax on investment gains and losses, net55Life insurance segment profit$                        8$                        7 Property Casualty Insurance Reconciliation(Dollars in millions)Three months ended March 31, 2023ConsolidatedCommercialPersonalE&amp;SOther*Premiums:   Written premiums$           2,019$           1,141$              448$              136$                294   Unearned premiums change(178)(85)16(9)(100)   Earned premiums$           1,841$           1,056$              464$              127$                194Underwriting profit (loss)$               (10)$                 (2)$               (57)$                 13$                  36(Dollars in millions)Three months ended March 31, 2022ConsolidatedCommercialPersonalE&amp;SOther*Premiums:   Written premiums$           1,899$           1,096$              374$              124$                305   Unearned premiums change(281)(134)28(12)(163)   Earned premiums$           1,618$              962$              402$              112$                142Underwriting profit $              165$                 76$                 65$                 16$                    8  Dollar amounts shown are rounded to millions; certain amounts may not add due to rounding. *Included in Other are the results of Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global.Cincinnati Financial CorporationOther MeasuresValue creation ratio: This is a measure of shareholder value creation that management believes captures the contribution of the company's insurance operations, the success of its investment strategy and the importance placed on paying cash dividends to shareholders. The value creation ratio measure is made up of two primary components: (1) rate of growth in book value per share plus (2) the ratio of dividends declared per share to beginning book value per share. Management believes this measure is useful, providing a meaningful measure of long-term progress in creating shareholder value. It is intended to be all-inclusive regarding changes in book value per share, and uses originally reported book value per share in cases where book value per share has been adjusted, such as adoption of Accounting Standards Updates with a cumulative effect of a change in accounting.Written premium: Under statutory accounting rules in the U.S., property casualty written premium is the amount recorded for policies issued and recognized on an annualized basis at the effective date of the policy. Management analyzes trends in written premium to assess business efforts. The difference between written and earned premium is unearned premium.Value Creation Ratio Calculations(Dollars are per share)Three months ended March 31,20232022Book value change per shareBook value as originally reported March 31, 2022$            75.43Cumulative effect of change in accounting for long-duration insurance contracts, net of tax(1.12)Book value as adjusted March 31, 2022$            74.31Value creation ratio:   End of period book value* - as originally reported $           68.33$            75.43   Less beginning of period book value - as originally reported  67.0181.72   Change in book value - as originally reported 1.32(6.29)   Dividend declared to shareholders0.750.69   Total value creation $             2.07$            (5.60)Value creation ratio from change in book value**2.0 %(7.7) %Value creation ratio from dividends declared to shareholders***  1.10.8Value creation ratio3.1 %(6.9) %    * Book value per share is calculated by dividing end of period total shareholders' equity by end of period shares outstanding  ** Change in book value divided by the beginning of period book value *** Dividend declared to shareholders divided by beginning of period book value Cincinnati Financial Corporation logo.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Homer Bhullar, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.Homer BhullarGood morning, everyone, and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman and CEO; Lane Riggs, our President and COO; Jason Fraser, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Gary Simmons, our Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and several other members of Valero's senior management team. If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at investorvalero.com.Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments and reconciliations and disclosures for adjusted metrics mentioned on this call. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call.I would now like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by safe harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our earnings release and filings with the SEC.Now I'll turn the call over to Joe for opening remarks.Story continuesJoseph W. GorderThanks, Homer, and good morning, everyone. We had another strong quarter with all of our segments performing well. Our refineries operated at 93% capacity utilization rate despite planned maintenance at several facilities. Our ability to optimize and maximize system throughput while undertaking maintenance activities illustrates the benefits from our long-standing commitment to operational excellence. Refining margins were supported by lower industry refining capacity in a backdrop of strong product demand.I'm also proud to report that the Port Arthur Coker project was completed in March and successfully started up in early April, which is a testament to the strength of our engineering and operations teams. The project is expected to increase the refinery's throughput capacity and ability to process incremental volumes of sour crude oils and residual feedstocks while also improving turnaround efficiency.Our Renewable Diesel segment set another sales volume record in the first quarter, with the continued ramp-up of DGD Port Arthur, which was started up in November 2022. In January, we announced that DGD approved a sustainable aviation project at Port Arthur, Texas. The DGD Port Arthur plant will have the capability to upgrade approximately 50% of its current 470 million-gallon annual renewable diesel production capacity to sustainable aviation fuel or SAF. The project is expected to be completed in 2025 and is estimated to cost approximately $315 million, with half of that attributable to Valero. With the completion of this project, DGD is expected to be 1 of the largest manufacturers of SAF in the world.In the Ethanol segment, BlackRock and Navigator's carbon sequestration project is progressing, and they expect to begin start-up activities in late 2024. We expect to be the anchor shipper with 8 of our ethanol plants connected to this system, which will allow us to produce a lower carbon-intensity ethanol product and significantly improve the margin profile and competitive positioning of our Ethanol business. And we continue to advance other low-carbon opportunities, such as renewable hydrogen, alcohol-to-jet and additional renewable naphtha and carbon sequestration projects. All of our projects must meet a minimum return threshold to continue to progress through our gated review process.On the financial side, we continue to strengthen our balance sheet, reducing debt by $199 million in the first quarter and ending the quarter with a net debt to capitalization ratio of 18%. In January, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend on our common stock from $0.98 per share to $1.02 per share, demonstrating our long-standing commitment to stockholder returns.Looking ahead, we expect refining fundamentals to remain supported by low global light product inventories, tight product supply and demand balances and continued increase in product demand as we approach peak air travel and summer driving season.In closing, our team continues to successfully execute a strategy that enables us to meet the challenge of supplying the world's need for reliable and affordable energy in an environmentally responsible manner. The tenets of our strategy, underpinned by operational excellence, deploying capital with an uncompromising focus on returns and honoring our commitment to stockholders have been in place for nearly a decade and continue to position us well for the future.So with that, Homer, I'll hand the call back to you.Homer BhullarThanks, Joe. For the first quarter of 2023, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $3.1 billion or $8.29 per share compared to $905 million or $2.21 per share for the first quarter of 2022.First quarter 2023 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $3.1 billion or $8.27 per share compared to $944 million or $2.31 per share for the first quarter of 2022. For reconciliations to adjusted amounts, please refer to the earnings release and the accompanying earnings release tables.The Refining segment reported $4.1 billion of operating income for the first quarter of 2023 compared to $1.5 billion for the first quarter of 2022. Refining throughput volumes in the first quarter of 2023 averaged 2.9 million barrels per day, which was 130,000 barrels per day higher than the first quarter of 2022. Throughput capacity utilization was 93% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 89% in the first quarter of 2022.Refining cash operating expenses were $4.78 per barrel in the first quarter of 2023, lower than guidance of $4.95, primarily attributed to higher throughput and lower natural gas prices.Renewable Diesel segment operating income was $205 million for the first quarter of 2023 compared to $149 million for the first quarter of 2022. Renewable diesel sales volumes averaged 3 million gallons per day in the first quarter of 2023, which was 1.3 million gallons per day higher than the first quarter of 2022. The higher sales volumes in the first quarter of 2023 were due to the impact of additional volumes from the start-up of the DGD Port Arthur plant in the fourth quarter of 2022.The Ethanol segment reported $39 million of operating income for the first quarter of 2023 compared to $1 million for the first quarter of 2022. Ethanol production volumes averaged 4.2 million gallons per day in the first quarter of 2023, which was 138,000 gallons per day higher than the first quarter of 2022.For the first quarter of 2023, G&amp;A expenses were $244 million and net interest expense was $146 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $650 million, and income tax expense was $880 million for the first quarter of 2023. The effective tax rate was 22%.Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.2 billion in the first quarter of 2023. Excluding the unfavorable change in working capital of $534 million in the first quarter and the other joint venture member share of DGD's net cash provided by operating activities excluding changes in DGD's working capital, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $3.6 billion.Regarding investing activities, we made $524 million of capital investments in the first quarter of 2023, of which $341 million was for sustaining the business, including costs for turnarounds, catalysts and regulatory compliance, and $183 million was for growing the business.Excluding capital investments attributable to the other joint venture members share of DGD, capital investments attributable to Valero were $467 million in the first quarter of 2023.Moving to financing activities. We returned over $1.8 billion to our stockholders in the first quarter of 2023, of which $379 million was paid as dividends and $1.5 billion was for the purchase of approximately 11 million shares of common stock, resulting in a payout ratio of 52% of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities.With respect to our balance sheet, as Joe mentioned, we completed additional debt reduction transactions in the first quarter that reduced Valero's debt by $199 million through opportunistic open market repurchases. We ended the quarter with $9 billion of total debt, $2.4 billion of finance lease obligations and $5.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents. The debt-to-capitalization ratio, net of cash and cash equivalents, was 18% as of March 31, 2023. And we ended the quarter well capitalized with $5.4 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash.Turning to guidance. We expect capital investments attributable to Valero for 2023 to be approximately $2 billion, which includes expenditures for turnarounds, catalysts and joint venture investments. About $1.5 billion of that is allocated to sustaining the business and the balance to growth.For modeling our second quarter operations, we expect Refining throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: Gulf Coast at 1.73 million to 1.78 million barrels per day; Mid-Continent at 405,000 to 425,000 barrels per day; West Coast at 250,000 to 270,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 450,000 to 470,000 barrels per day. We expect Refining cash operating expenses in the second quarter to be approximately $4.60 per barrel.With respect to the Renewable Diesel segment, we expect sales volumes to be approximately 1.2 billion gallons in 2023. Operating expenses in 2023 should be [$0.49] per gallon, which includes $0.19 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization.Our Ethanol segment is expected to produce 4.2 million gallons per day in the second quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.40 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization.For the second quarter, net interest expense should be about $145 million, and total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $670 million. For 2023, we expect G&amp;A expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, to be approximately $925 million.That concludes our opening remarks. (Operator Instructions)Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from the line of Manav Gupta with UBS.Manav GuptaCongrats on a very good result. I'm not sure if there are many other refiners out there who can show this kind of capture with such heavy turnaround. So congrats on that. I have two quick questions and I'll ask them upfront. We keep seeing DOE data, which is prone to revisions, but sometimes doesn't actually make too much sense. So Joe, in your system across various products, what are you seeing in terms of demand for various products in your system?And the second and related question is, help us understand a little bit what's going on in the diesel market. Are we suddenly oversupplied? Is the demand weak? If you could just talk through those diesel dynamics.Joseph W. GorderNo, Manav, we're happy to do that, and thanks for your comments. Gary, do you want to give them some insight?Gary K. SimmonsYes, sure. So, so far, our 7-day average in our wholesale system, our gasoline sales are up 16% year-over-year. Our diesel volumes are up 25% year-over-year. So our wholesale team continues to do a great job.In March, we set a record at 998,000 barrels a day. In April, the volumes are trending right along those levels. So demand seems very, very strong in our system. And even the DTN data for the wholesale racks across the industry is very strong as well.In terms of your question on diesel weakness, we're just not seeing it. I can tell you, in addition to the wholesale volumes, today, there's domestic arbs that are open from PADD 3 into PADD 2 as we're seeing a surge in agricultural demand that's going along with planting season. You also have a domestic arb open to ship from PADD 3 to PADD 1. We see strong waterborne premiums to go to Latin America. The transatlantic arb is open to Europe. And so for us, distillate fundamentals look pretty good.OperatorOur next question is coming from the line of Theresa Chen with Barclays.Theresa ChenCan you comment on your outlook for Gulf Coast capture from here? Clearly, the start-up of the Port Arthur Coker should be a tailwind, but we've also seen differentials come in. Net-net, how do you view the profitability of your Gulf Coast system, both near term and longer term?R. Lane RiggsYes, this is Lane. I'll (inaudible) some general comments about capture rates, sort of compare our first quarter capture rate to our second quarter capture rate. Holding all things equal, we'll blend less butane. So everything -- pulling everything equal, our capture rate will actually fall just due to butane. And then as you alluded to, you look at feedstocks, what's the trajectory of feedstocks, they're lower. On the other side of it, we're seeing big RBOB premiums versus CBOB. So to the extent that, that's not captured in our capture rate, that's actually a positive.So there are several things you just got to look at. And what you got to focus on are the -- some of the drivers that may not be in our formula for our crack attainment and how those change relative to things those are tied to. An example would be Maya versus WCS or, like I said, RBOB versus CBOB. Those are the things you guys kind of key on trying to predict maybe how our crack attainment looks.Theresa ChenAnd on a related note, how do you see the VGO situation evolving in terms of your Gulf Coast consumption as well as the global supply following the EU embargo on Russian products as well as the Saudis exporting less after [Keystone] bought its conversion unit?R. Lane RiggsWell, I'll start on at least our system and let Gary kind of look at -- talk about the supply. The start-up of our Port Arthur Coker goes a long way to shoring up our VGO position. Essentially, that's where it is. It's taking resid and heavier crudes and cracking into sort of -- in the distillate and essentially a VGO boiling range material. So it allows us to sort of -- our requirement for importing VGO has fallen post the new coker startup.Gary K. SimmonsYes. In terms of supply, I think we were concerned that the ramp-up in sanctions against Russia would limit VGO exports and cause VGO tightness. So far, it looks like the Russian barrels are continuing to flow. And so we're not nearly as concerned about VGO supply as we were earlier in the year.OperatorOur next question is coming from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America.Kaleinoheaokealaula Scott AkamineThis is Kalei on for Doug. I've got a follow-up to Theresa's question, and it really goes to the availability of heavy sours that are in the market. There is a perception that, that length is getting shorter with OPEC cuts and then increased demand from new projects such as [YER] Coker and perhaps MPC's resid hydrocracker are squeezing the market for those kind of supplies. Can you talk about what you guys are seeing and if the phased start-ups of the new refineries, where not all the units are online, could help alleviate that situation.Gary K. SimmonsYes. So I'll go through. We have seen -- during the first quarter, we saw the supply-demand balances around heavy sour get tighter. Some of it is supply. You also see -- saw Chinese refinery utilization ramp-up, which put more demand in the system. But going forward, I think there are some bullish factors. Platts is reporting 500,000 barrels a day. Canadian crude production is off-line due to maintenance. We'll get that production back. Venezuelan production is forecasted to grow. And our view is that more Chevron production from that region will make its way into the Gulf as we progress through the year.At some point in time, all indications are that the Lyondell refinery will come down, which will kick more heavy sour back to the market. And then if the demand and -- the supply-demand balances that are currently being forecasted are correct, at some point in time, you'll need that OPEC production back on the market, which again is bullish to differentials.Kaleinoheaokealaula Scott AkamineGot it. And a quick follow-up to that. Can you talk about what you're seeing for new refining capacity that's supposed to come online, like Dangote and Dos Bocas in Mexico?Gary K. SimmonsYes, I really can't make a comment. We don't have a lot of insight into either one of those refineries.OperatorThank you. Our next question is coming from the line of John Royall with JPMorgan.John Macalister RoyallSo I just wanted to start on the return of capital side. You guys returned above your 40% to 50% range again this quarter, I think second quarter in a row. What's your latest thinking on where you want to be in that range of returns to shareholders given your balance sheet is very strong, but fundamentals appear to be ticking down and you can see that in your indicators.Jason W. FraserYes. No, that's right. This is Jason. And you're right, our balance sheet is in good shape right now. We've got up over $5.5 billion of cash, we feel pretty strong there. We got our net debt to cap ratio down into a good spot around 18%, which is well at the lower end of our range. So we feel like we're in a pretty good spot with regard to any potential recessionary conditions.And as far as our target for where we want to be in our range, we'll continue to target the 40% to 50% when we have strong results. Of course, we'll be looking at the upper end. Of that, we ended at 45% last year, paid out 52% this quarter. Actually with the extra cash we had, we did kind of an all-of-the-above strategy, we were able to build our cash by $600 million. Payout at 52% and also paid back a little more debt. So it will just depend on how the year plays out, where we fall in the range, right, in the payout range.John Macalister RoyallGreat. And then I was hoping you could also touch on the regulatory changes out in California and how you expect those to play out and the potential impact on both your business and maybe just the broad refining market in California.Richard Joe WalshThis is Rich. I can start out with just sort of the regulatory climate. California has always been a tough regulatory climate for operations. And so I'm assuming you're talking about the California SBX1-2, rulemaking is out there. And what we would just say is that the bill does have some burden, some reporting requirements in it. And then obviously, it kicks basically a profit tax over to this California Energy Commission to implement it. So we'll stay active and engaged in that rulemaking process and watch what develops out of the agency there. It's unclear what price cap, if any, they'll ultimately put in place.I would point out that the rulemaking on that, the standard that the agency is supposed to use is they're supposed to determine that the benefits to consumers are outweighed by the potential cost to consumers. And it goes without saying that attempts by governments to artificially limit commodity prices has never been really good for the economy and it ultimately ends up hurting consumers. So we'll just have to see how that all plays out.Joseph W. GorderAnd John, this is Joe. Just let me bolt on something to what Rich said. So it's -- we have a great team operating both of our refineries on the West Coast. Great teams are running those plants. And we have been very consistent and clear in our approach to the California business. That is we aggressively manage the capital, we invest to maintain safe and reliable operations out there, but we haven't invested capital in growing that business for many years now.Now historically, California, in a normal operating environment, isn't a strong contributor to our earnings. We've always viewed it as an option on periodically strong margins. And if the margin caps are set at levels that remove the upside, the opportunity to earn a return isn't there the way it's been in the past and we'll have to evaluate our options.Right now, Rich and his team are communicating to the California Energy Commission and others the concerns that we have, and we're just going to have to wait and see what happens out there. So it is an environment that is a difficult operating environment. I would not even take a shot at stating what might happen to the overall refining environment out there, but I can just tell you that from our perspective, we're just going to have to watch it and see and then we'll evaluate our options.OperatorThe next question is coming from the line of Paul Sankey with Sankey Research.Paul Benedict SankeyCould you repeat the wholesale sales demand number that you just gave and explain how come, if I heard you right, that's growing so massively.Gary K. SimmonsYes. So our wholesale on the gasoline side, we're up 16% year-over-year. On distillate, we're up 25% year-over-year. March, we set a sales volume record 998,000 barrels a day. And then April, the volumes are trending about like they did in March.So certainly, when you look at the broader DTN wholesale volume data, it's not as significant growth is what we're seeing, and so it indicates we're doing a good job of capturing market share.Paul Benedict SankeySo there's no structural change. It's just better wholesale performance?Gary K. SimmonsYes.Paul Benedict SankeyOkay. I'm not counting that as a question, Joe.Joseph W. GorderPaul, we could talk all day.Paul Benedict SankeyI'm in D.C. actually. On the IRA, what's your latest thinking on how that could impact your business in terms of the regulatory environment? We've had -- we've dealt with the California one, I think, on the call already, but if you've got any latest thoughts on how things in Washington are shifting.And the other one, I guess, is a big deal here. Obviously, it's carbon capture and how you're thinking about that.Richard Joe WalshWell, this is Rich Walsh again. I guess I'll take an effort to respond on that in terms of -- I think you're probably alluding to some negotiations that are going on right now. And just this morning, I think the Republican bill has been revised to include some of the credits to be back in that they were proposing to pull out. And so we're looking at the clean energy tax credits being put back in, and so the things that help us on our renewable side and some of our sequestration projects back in.And they also have grandfathered those that have already made investment decisions on the (inaudible) while SAF is out, the projects that have been announced on SAF are back in. So that means our projects would be still eligible for the proper treatments on that.Paul Benedict SankeyYes. Got it. I think that SAF is definitely a very interesting one. Okay. And then generally speaking, in the market, do you -- we've seen margins come off an awful lot, which is a bit odd seasonally. Is there anything that you can observe about -- especially given what you're saying about your wholesale margins, your wholesale deliveries. The big sell-off that we've seen here is somehow doesn't seem to be entirely supported by fundamentals. We had a great gasoline demand number, for example, this week in the DOE. Any thoughts on how Q2 is going to shape out? And I'll leave it there.Gary K. SimmonsYes, Paul, our view is whenever inventory is as low as it is today, it just puts you way out on the margin curve where the slope is really steep and any type of market news can have a significant impact on prices and margins. So early in the year, the market headlines were all about losing Russian supply with the ramp-up in sanctions and it drove the market up. Today, I think people are generally comfortable that the Russian barrels will continue to flow and then a lot of concern on the economy and what happens with demand in the future. As I've said, we're not seeing any indication of demand weakness today, but I think that's a concern as what happens in the future.OperatorThe next question is coming from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo.Roger David ReadYes, I'd like to follow up, Joe -- I'd like to follow up on the comments or how you're looking at the diesel and gasoline markets. I mean there's a ton of ways to track demand and shortfalls of supply. But one we pay attention to is each end of the Colonial Pipeline, and it shows clear stress in the gasoline market. So I guess I'd like to dig into maybe what you see in the Atlantic Basin, particularly between New York and Northwest Europe in terms of just outright gasoline supply. Or is it a component issue? Or what exactly is going on there?Gary K. SimmonsYes. So I think there are several factors that come into play there, Roger. Historically, we see an incentive to store summer-grade gasoline or components to New York Harbor. This winter, the market structure really made it where it wasn't economic to do that. And so we did build inventory for that.And then, again, typically in the first quarter, you see a lot of volume going across the Atlantic from Europe into New York Harbor early in the year, and the strikes that occurred in France kind of minimized those volumes as well.So we've come into driving season with 10 million barrels below where we were last year on gasoline inventory. So especially summer grade gasoline is very tight, and it is going to stress the Colonial system as we move into driving season.Roger David ReadYes. I mean it's early in the quarter, but really haven't seen the gap quite this large at this time of the year before. So it definitely shows stress. Follow-up question, if I could, on the SAF. Obviously, you mentioned there are some opportunities in terms of what's moving forward legislatively. If you weren't to see, let's call it, fundamental support for SAF margins, do you want to make SAF? I mean, what's the driver to do that versus renewable diesel which obviously already enjoys support as well as LCFS programs.Unidentified Company RepresentativeRoger, this is Eric. I think we still see a big demand for SAF in the future. The EU just talked about mandating it beginning in 2025 and at increasing percentages as you get to 2030 and 2050. So the IRA isn't the only driver for SAF. I think, between what we see in different jurisdictions starting to obligate jet and make it a mandatory requirement as well as just the internal commitments that a lot of the airlines and cargo carriers have made from a corporate standpoint, we still see that SAF is going to be a strategic growth area for renewables.OperatorThe next question is coming from the line of Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler.Ryan M. ToddMaybe I'll stick for one follow-up on the low carbon fuel side. Can you talk a little bit about a couple of the carbon possibilities that you mentioned earlier in the call, you mentioned renewable hydrogen, alcohol-to-jet. What would either of those projects look like in your current operations? And are there further changes in product prices or regulatory support that would be required to make either of those businesses make sense?Unidentified Company RepresentativeWell, I think -- this is Eric again. In particular, I'll start with ethanol-to-jet. Assuming the Navigator project goes forward, that will lower the carbon intensity of our ethanol to a point where it will qualify as a feedstock into SAF. And so if you look at that as the precursor project that would then enable an ethanol to jet SAF project, that's one of the things we're looking at. Now that's years out from anything we would talk about in any sort of detail, but conceptually that's kind of what would line up that possibility from a project standpoint.And then renewable hydrogen, that's another sort of horizon opportunity, that as you look at your low-carbon platforms, if you can make blue or green hydrogen, it's just another way to further lower your CIs on your low carbon operations.Ryan M. ToddGreat. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on the Port Author Coker. Is there -- congratulations on getting that started up. Is there any sort of ramp associated with operations there? How should we expect kind of contributions to that in the second quarter? And any kind of updates or thoughts on what the -- what you think the annualized EBITDA contribution is in the current environment?R. Lane RiggsYes, this is Lane. So we started it up on April 5. I would say actually, this week, we've sort of ramped up most of the refinery up to where we're running. We're close to fuel -- to full. We're sort of from now through the rest of the quarter, you will see the least of benefit of (inaudible). Clean start-up, as Joe alluded to earlier in his comments. It was done really well by our team. It's working just as we had indicated.In terms of the contribution on EBITDA, when you take sort of the current volumetrics and use forward pricing on it, it's normally about $0.5 billion a year is the benefit.OperatorOur next question is coming from the line of Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen.Jason Daniel GabelmanI wanted to ask one on market structure. I think there's some concern because there's headlines around Asia cutting refining runs because margins are low there and there's some concern that, that could permeate into the U.S. And so the question is, how should the market kind of take that indicator? Should they think that while Asia margins are falling and so U.S. will follow because there's global weakness? Or conversely, because Asia margins are falling, U.S. cracks are around the level they are, probably closer to a floor, because of the structural kind of tailwinds that are out there and Asia is kind of absorbing all of the throughput declines related to global demand issues? I know it's a bit of a complex question, but I guess, give it a shot.Gary K. SimmonsYes. So I think the way we would view it is much like you said, we would view it as it's kind of telling us where the floor on margins. It's not just Asia, but in Europe hydroskimming margins are negative. And so a lot of that is the distillate weakness. We still see diesel inventory very, very low. And we view that some of that capacity should actually be running. And so it's kind of telling you we're the floor on where margins are.Jason Daniel GabelmanOkay. That's helpful. And then the follow-up on DGD. Where are we in terms of the DGD distribution? Have you received one yet? Is that coming soon? And how are you thinking about that cash being moved up to the partners moving forward?Unidentified Company RepresentativeYes. We've looked at the DGD cash flow, and we would still say we see a distribution in the back half of this year becoming an opportunity for the partners.Jason Daniel GabelmanOkay. Any idea around the quantity?Unidentified Company RepresentativeNo, we're not going to give a number like that out, but it does look positive through the end of the year.OperatorOur next question is coming from the line of Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.Matthew Robert Lovseth BlairJoe, could you help us understand the Q1 refining capture, a strong figure, a little bit more. I think Lane mentioned butane blending was a tailwind. What else drove it up? And I guess, specifically, were product exports more of a supporting factor than normal? And then also, was there any impact from turning in the 2021 RINs, like any sort of mark-to-market as you submitted the 2021 RINs in March of 23?R. Lane RiggsSo Matt, this is Lane. I'll start out with the first part of it. So the things that are contributing factors were we had backwardation sort of flattened out in the market on feedstock. That's always one you get. So market structure plays into capture rates in a big way. So it's tightened out some. You had wider differentials in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter on all the crudes that we run.And then finally, there were pretty good jet premiums versus distillate in the first quarter. Those are the other things driving our capture rate. With respect to the other RIN mentioned...Joseph W. GorderI don't think the RIN had anything to do with it.Gary K. SimmonsAnd I wouldn't say exports had any kind of material impact on capture rates either.Matthew Robert Lovseth BlairGreat. And then on the Q2 Refining guidance, it looks like it implies about 90% to 93% utilization. You already did 93% in Q1. So I guess I'd be surprised if it ticks down. Is that just -- should we think about it as just a conservative number? Or are there -- are there major turnarounds that we should be aware of that's pulling down your Q2 expected run rate?R. Lane RiggsYes, we -- this is Lane. We have a policy of not really commenting directly on our turnaround activity, but I would just take the guidance to be kind of where we think it's going to be.Joseph W. GorderYes. And Matthew, I mean, you know our history and our tendency. I mean we're not going to oversell anything. So we'll just -- we'll see how the markets look. And Lane is right, we'll operate as appropriate.OperatorWe have no additional questions at this time. So I'll pass the floor over to management for any additional closing remarks.Homer BhullarThanks, Jesse. We appreciate everyone joining us today. Obviously, feel free to contact the IR team if you have any questions. Have a great week. Thank you, everyone.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, this does conclude our call and webcast. You may disconnect your lines at this time. We thank you for your participation.]"

Crude recovering, stabilizing today after a sharp sell off Wednesday. Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferre is here with more. Ines.INES FERRE: Yeah, that's right. Oil today rebounding slightly. It was down more than 3% yesterday. Look, the concerns around oil has been concerns about a recession, concerns about if the banking situation gets worse. So that's why we saw some fluctuation.Despite that production cut, that OPEC plus had announced earlier in April, you saw oil spike then when that announcement was made. And it has since come down since then. But we are going to get earnings from Chevron, from ExxonMobil tomorrow. And analysts are forecasting that for 2023, both Chevron and ExxonMobil, their profits will be coming down from the highs of 2022.Remember that last year, you had the invasion of Ukraine. You had oil going up to 130. And so you had these big oil companies that were making record profits for the year. What's been interesting is just listening to some commentary. For example, Valero Energy commentary from their earnings call. Valero saying that wholesale diesel sales, those were up 25% year over year. Also, gasoline sales up 16%.And CEO Gary Simmons saying that Valero doesn't see diesel weakness with strong agricultural demand. So some interesting commentary there. And we'll be watching the commentary from ExxonMobil and Chevron.- All right. Well, Ines, ExxonMobil, let's talk about some of the reports that we have heard about this company over the last month or so. They did make some waves following the report, that it did hold talks-- takeover talks, excuse me-- with Pioneer Resources. Now there is a new report signaling that we could see more deals within the energy sector. What are we potentially looking at?Story continuesINES FERRE: Yeah, that's. Right this is a report from KPMG that basically is looking at quarter by quarter since 2021 M&amp;A activity. And just to give you some perspective, comparing the first quarter of 2021 to the first quarter of 2023, you saw M&amp;A in 2021 at $24 billion in that first quarter, compared to $15 billion of M&amp;A activity in the first quarter of this year.And part of this has to do with decarbonization efforts. So you have these oil and gas companies that are looking for targets that are going to improve their environmental profile. However, now you've got energy companies that are sitting on a lot of cash. And that they want some drilling-- they would like drilling sites for the future.And so the report is basically saying that you could see more M&amp;A activity going forward, especially because some of these companies are sitting on so much cash. You had The Wall Street Journal that recently talked about ExxonMobil eyeing the acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources, Seana, and ExxonMobil, as I just mentioned, had record profits last year.]"

This compares to earnings of $2.31 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 14.23%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this oil refiner would post earnings of $7.45 per share when it actually produced earnings of $8.45, delivering a surprise of 13.42%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Valero Energy , which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, posted revenues of $36.44 billion for the quarter ended March 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 26.14%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $38.54 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Valero Energy shares have lost about 8.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 5.6%.What's Next for Valero Energy?While Valero Energy has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Valero Energy: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock.

The figure fell behind the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8,000 million and our estimate of $7,956 million.Total operating expenses of $7,694 million climbed 4% year over year in the first quarter due to higher medical care costs, general and administrative expenses, and depreciation and amortization expenses.

And with that, I am happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Nick Zarcone.Story continuesDominick P. ZarconeThank you, Joe, and good morning to everybody on the call. This morning, I will provide some high-level comments related to our performance in the quarter, and then Rick will dive into the financial details before I come back with a few closing remarks.On February 28, the company kicked off a year-long celebration of our 25th anniversary by ringing the opening bell at NASDAQ. The celebration is focused on our 25-year history, our customers, our employees, the communities that we serve and further energizing our global team about our future. Following this initial celebration, we hosted leadership conferences in both North America and Europe for key leaders across each of our operating segments where we all had a chance to celebrate, educate and collaborate on our past successes and share the excitement of what the future holds for LKQ.While we've had a great run since 1998, I am highly confident that the next 25 years will be even better. As an organization, we have always held a core set of values that has helped us achieve our success and created the LKQ we are today. Like all aspects of life, change is inevitable and as an organization, it's critical that we advance our values forward to lay the foundation for the next 25 years.Keeping us moving forward. During the quarter, I had the pleasure to announce our updated values for the future. Values that unite our global enterprise as a cohesive and focused one LKQ and that will serve as a single guide to ensure we deliver on the promises we hold true for all constituents. The values are development, excellence, leadership, integrity and trust, value-added, embracing change, resourceful and sustainability. Simply put, it spells DELIVERS. Expanding on the word DELIVERS, the one LKQ team across the globe delivered a solid first quarter performance and an outstanding start to 2023.During the quarter, our 2 largest segments, North America and Europe exceeded our expectations as our teams embraced our operational excellence initiatives. The first quarter of 2023 started the year where 2022 left off, as the resilience of our business shine through a myriad of uncontrollable headwinds ranging from economic softness, inflation, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, energy cost spikes and a war in Europe. The continuation of exceptional organic revenue growth and strong margins in our North American and European segments more than offset the impact of the headwinds experienced by our specialty and self-service segments. The variance in performance across our operating segments this quarter validates our long-term diversification strategy, both with respect to geography and product and speaks to the true strength of our organization and our portfolio of businesses. Now on to the first quarter 2023 results and year-over-year comparisons. Revenue was $3.3 billion in the first quarter for both 2023 and 2022. Parts and services organic revenue increased 7.9% on a reported basis and 7.1% on a per day basis. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures decreased revenue by 3.3% and foreign exchange rates decreased revenue by a further 3% for total parts and services revenue increase of 1.5%.Other revenue fell 19.2% in the first quarter of 2023, primarily due to weaker precious metal prices relative to the same period in 2022. Net income was $270 million in Q1 of this year as compared to $269 million last year, as better operating results more than offset the negative impacts related to soft foreign currency exchange rates, higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate.Adjusted net income was $279 million in Q1 of 2023 as compared to $287 million last year, a decrease of 2.8%. Diluted earnings per share was $1.01 in Q1 of this year compared to $0.94 last year, an increase of 7.4%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share in Q1 was $1.04 this year as compared to $1 even last year, an increase of 4%. The increases in earnings per share relative to the changes in net income illustrate the positive impact of our historical share repurchase activity.Let's turn to some of the quarterly segment highlights. As you will note from Slide 7, organic revenue for parts and services in North America increased 14.4% on a reported basis, a record first quarter performance. North America also reported its highest quarterly segment EBITDA margin on record. Rick will cover the segment level margin details shortly. We continue to perform well in North America, especially when you consider that according to CCC, collision liability-related auto claims were down 4.4% year-over-year in the first quarter.Our growth was balanced between price and volume improvements, the latter of which was particularly evident in the aftermarket product line, which was the result of 2 factors: First, having largely worked through the industry supply chain issues and having proper levels of inventory enabled us to get back to our historical level of fulfillment rates. Second, the impact of the State Farm program is unfolding nicely and building demand for aftermarket headlights, taillights and bumper covers. This upward trend in our aftermarket sales volumes is consistent with a general rise in APU, which approached prepandemic levels in the first quarter. I am pleased to say that the increase in APU also included an uptick in the recycled parts category, increasing 150 basis points year-over-year. Combined, aftermarket and recycled parts have witnessed nearly a 500 basis point improvement in APU since the first quarter of 2022.The value proposition of alternative parts is gaining share from OEs as insurance carriers face both catastrophic losses from all the storm activity in the quarter and premium pressures as policyholders are tightening up their spending in the midst of an ongoing soft economy. Total loss rates increased slightly in the first quarter to about 19%. But as you can see, it appears that total losses had little to no impact on our organic growth.Based on industry research, we expect total loss rates to end the year in the range of 18% to 19% as the market absorbs the recent increase in used car prices as we've entered 2023. Now moving on to our European segment.Europe organic revenue for parts and services in the quarter increased 9.7% on a reported basis and 8.2% on a per day basis, which represents the best first quarter per day organic revenue growth since 2016, when we were a much smaller organization and operating in only 6 European countries as compared to over 20 today.I'd also like to highlight that Europe's segment EBITDA margin was the highest first quarter level since 2016. During the first quarter, we saw high single-digit to low double-digit reported organic growth in each of our key operating geographies. In particular, our Benelux, German and Eastern European operations performed exceptionally well. The revenue growth reflected a combination of positive movements in both price and volume. We believe we are continuing to take share in these large and highly fragmented markets.The European team is laser-focused on the cost structure, including rationalizing headcount to create a more nimble and agile team and focusing on a narrow and actionable list of key projects. With that operational focus, the European team delivered the lowest first quarter SG&amp;A level since 2017, notwithstanding a challenging inflationary environment.Additionally, the European team began the integration of the Rhenoy salvage and remanufacturing acquisition that we announced during the last earnings call. In addition, we are ramping up our location count in France with the opening of a distribution center in Marseille earlier this month, bringing our total location count in France to 7. Now let's move on to our Specialty segment.During the first quarter, Specialty reported a decrease in organic revenue of 13%, which was below our expectations. The RV portion of our specialty business was impacted by the wholesale shipment and retail unit sales of RVs, which are down 57.7% and down 23.7% year-to-date through February, respectively. We expect to see further declines in the RV market as recent industry reports project that full year 2023 wholesale shipments will be down about 34% year-over-year. So we believe that the challenges for our specialty segment will continue throughout 2023.As we work through the balance of the year, our efforts will be focused on the RV repair and service as RV usage rates remain strong and the ongoing growth in light vehicle sales by building the right inventory to service this market space. Truck, off-road and performance parts revenue are also down on a year-over-year basis, but less than what we are seeing in the RV sector. Notably, Specialties Marine business posted organic growth of 10.4% in the quarter, and we are gaining share in this attractive market.Despite the industry-wide headwinds and the cyclical nature of this segment, there is no one in the SEMA or RV distribution space that has such a talented team and has the experience and Lean Six Sigma capabilities to effectively manage through a down cycle. Now on to our self-service segment.Organic revenue for parts and services for our self-service segment increased 4.9% in the first quarter. Self-service was again challenged by soft commodity pricing, particularly as it related to precious metals, which manifested itself in a significant drop in the value received for recycled catalytic converters. We believe that the challenges for self-service will persist for the balance of the year as well.While the rate of inflation is coming down across the globe, inflation continues to impact all of our businesses. Our teams are doing an effective job of getting price relief where possible and are using productivity improvements to offset the negative impact of the increased cost. Regarding labor, our open positions in North America dropped by 20% since year-end, but the challenges with turnover have not abated. The labor market in North America is still overheated and we are pushing wages and selected benefits to combat the issue.In Europe, we are also countering the labor tightness with wage increases to retain our employees and we have maintained low turnover levels in the first quarter. On the corporate development front, as most of you know, on February 27, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of Uni-Select's issued and outstanding shares for CAD 48 per share in cash, representing a total enterprise value of approximately USD 2.1 billion. Uni-Select is a leader in the distribution of automotive refinish and industrial coatings and related products in North America through its FinishMaster segment.In the automotive aftermarket parts business, Uni-Select operates through its Canadian Automotive Group segment up in Canada, and through its GSF Car Parts segment in the U.K. Today is Uni-Select's Special Shareholder Meeting and the final day that its shareholders may cast their votes on the transaction. So we don't yet have a final report. Considering that both ISS and Glass Lewis published reports supporting the transaction and that approximately 20% of Uni-Select shareholders entered into voting agreements to approve the transaction as part of signing of the acquisition agreement back in February. We are highly confident that Uni-Select shareholders will approve the transaction.We have submitted applications for approvals to the various regulatory authorities in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. And at this time, all the regulatory reviews are proceeding according to plan. Both the FTC in the United States and the Competitive Bureau in Canada have until May 11, 2023, to determine whether to issue a second request for information. To address any regulatory concerns in the U.K., we have commenced a process to sell Uni-Select GSF car parts business. Our adviser has started the buyer outreach process. And while we can't say much at this time, we are pleased with the initial interest level in the asset.Ultimately, we hope to receive the required approvals and to complete the Uni-Select acquisition in the second half of this year. Now let's turn to ESG. During the first quarter, we focused our people efforts on various social initiatives and in particular, education for both our employees and importantly, their families as they face the increasing cost of education. Recently, we enhanced 2 existing educational programs available to LKQ employees. The Joseph Holsten Scholarship Fund established over a decade ago provides grants to the children of our employees to assist with post high school educational expenses.Prior to 2022, the fund was only available to our North American team, but we expanded the program to include our entire global organization. Our goal is to distribute at least $1 million of scholarships in 2023. Additionally, in Q1 of this year, we increased our North American employee tuition reimbursement program by 100%. Our people are the biggest asset at LKQ and programs like the 2 I just mentioned are critical to enhancing employee engagement, which in turn supports the continued success of our business.Importantly, we are honored and proud to be part of the educational development and personal growth of our employees and their families. We look forward to issuing our 2023 CSR before the end of the second quarter, a report that will expand our sustainability disclosures across many aspects of our global enterprise. Lastly, before I turn the discussion over to Rick, who will run through the details of the segment results and discuss our outlook for 2023, I am pleased to announce that on April 25, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.275 per share of common stock payable on June 1, 2023 to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 18.Rick GallowayThank you, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us today. We're very pleased with the start to the year as our first quarter results highlight strong revenue growth and profitability. Our 2 largest segments, North America and Europe generated above-expectation revenue growth and margins as our operational excellence initiatives continued to yield benefits.The Specialty and Self-service segments underperformed in the quarter as market conditions continue to produce headwinds for both businesses. Overall, we are pleased with the good start to the year and are on track to deliver on our full year guidance. As discussed on our February call, in Q1, we replaced our prior credit facility, which included a $3.15 billion revolver with a new, unsecured facility, including a $500 million term loan and $2.0 billion revolver. We feel good about the new facility and our ability to fund our operating needs over the next 5 years at a competitive rate structure.Free cash flow generation remains solid, noting that the quarterly phasing will be weighted more to the balance of the year than we've seen in the past couple of years when phasing was impacted by the pandemic and supply chain disruptions. The pending Uni-Select acquisition was a source of significant activity during the quarter with due diligence, deal negotiations and post-announcement financing activities. Nick provided an update on the transaction status and I'll highlight the Uni-Select impacts on our first quarter financials.Turning now to first quarter results, starting with segment performance. Going to Slide 9. North America continued its strong performance, posting a record first quarter segment EBITDA margin of 20.5%, a 240 basis point improvement over last year. We saw gross margin improvement of 190 basis points, driven by lower freight costs, a favorable mix effect with the sale of the lower-margin PGW business in 2022 and benefits from pricing and productivity initiatives.Overhead expenses were flat with lower freight, vehicle and fuel expenses mostly offset by higher charitable contributions. The segment also reported a 50 basis point improvement in other income, mostly related to a nonrecurring settlement of an eminent domain matter. While we believe there will be some moderation in segment EBITDA margin in upcoming quarters as the benefits of the 2022 price increases fall away, the strong start to 2023 has improved our margin outlook to be in the 18s for the year.Europe also delivered a strong result with a segment EBITDA margin of 9.7%, up 90 basis points from the prior year. As seen on Slide 10, gross margin was flat, while overhead expenses decreased by 90 basis points with the effects of improved leverage due to the 8.2% per day organic revenue growth and an emphasis on productivity initiatives on personnel costs. We remain optimistic about our previously disclosed expectation for full year margin expansion of 20 to 30 basis points in 2023.Moving to Slide 11. Specialty's EBITDA margin of 7.9 declined 470 basis points compared to the prior year. Gross margin was down 320 basis points year-over-year, is under pressure from increased price competition as inventory availability continues to improve for our competitors, discounting to increased sales volumes and unfavorable product mix as low margin lines such as auto and marine have been less affected by revenue reductions. Overhead expenses as a percentage of revenue were up 150 basis points, primarily coming from the decrease in leverage driven by an organic revenue decline of 13.5% per day with impacts on personnel, facility and distribution costs. The macroeconomic headwinds and the resulting effects on RV demand are expected to be an ongoing challenge for specialty, and we're forecasting a full year decrease in both segment EBITDA dollars and margin percentage. As you can see on Slide 12, Self-Service profitability improved sequentially to 13.2% this quarter from 5.2% in the fourth quarter, but decreased by 680 basis points compared to Q1 2022.Metals prices had a net negative effect on results with lower precious metals prices more than offsetting lag benefits from sequential steel scrap price increases. Metal revenue decreased by 22.8% in total, contributing to a reduction in operating leverage of 450 basis points. While car costs typically move in tandem with changes in commodity prices, we have experienced a stickiness in car cost as precious metal prices have declined, which created a gross margin headwind in Q1 that could persist in future quarters.On to the consolidated results. We reported diluted earnings per share of $1.01 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.04, the latter of which is $0.04 increase relative to Q4 last year. Our operational performance showed strong year-over-year improvement and was slightly ahead of our expectations as strength in North America and Europe offset underperformance in Specialty and Self-service, reflecting challenging market conditions.The operating improvements resulted in an increase of $0.13 per share on an adjusted basis. We benefited by $0.05 due to the lower share count resulting from our share repurchases in 2022. These factors more than offset unfavorable year-over-year effects of $0.04 from the impacts of metals prices as shown on Slide 19, $0.04 in higher interest expense resulting from rate increases excluding the Uni-Select costs, $0.02 from foreign currency effects caused by the stronger dollar, $0.02 resulting from the divestiture of PGW in Q2 2022 and $0.02 due to a higher effective tax rate.On the tax rate, we applied an annual effective rate estimate of 26.6%, which is 30 basis points higher than the 26.3% rate in our prior guidance. The rate change is attributable to nondeductible Uni-Select transaction costs and a shift in the geographic distribution of income. As shown on Slide 17, the Uni-Select transaction affected various parts of the first quarter financials. We entered into a bridge loan facility to ensure committed financing was available for the Uni-Select transaction and incurred upfront fees of $9 million.Interest expense for the first quarter includes $3 million of amortization of these fees. The remainder will be amortized over the expected term of the facility likely before year-end. Note that we excluded the amortization from adjusted diluted EPS. To hedge the risk related to movements in the Canadian dollar exchange rate between signing and closing, we entered into FX forward contracts to purchase Canadian dollars at a specified rate. These contracts had a fair value of $23 million as of March 31. And as we are not eligible for hedge accounting on these contracts, the mark-to-market gain is reflected on the income statement as a separate line item.Note that this gain is also excluded from adjusted diluted EPS. We incurred M&amp;A advisory costs of $10 million in the quarter, which are presented in restructuring and transaction related costs -- related expenses. Consistent with our historical practice, these costs are excluded from adjusted diluted EPS. We also hedged the risk of movement in interest rates prior to the issuance of permanent financing in the bond market.These interest rate swaps had a negative fair value -- fair market value of $22 million, and these swaps did qualify for hedge accounting. The mark-to-market adjustment was recorded to the balance sheet, and there was no income statement activity in the quarter. We secured a delayed draw 3-year term loan for CAD 700 million that will fund on the day prior to closing.Shifting to cash flow and the balance sheet. We produced $153 million of free cash flow during the quarter, which is in line with our expectations, and we remain on track for our full year estimate of approximately $975 million. As mentioned, we expect 2023 cash phasing to be different than in the past few years with higher weighting towards Q2 to Q4. By comparison, in Q1 2022, free cash flow was $350 million, which we indicated was high as a result of timing.Recent years were particularly volatile in terms of cash flow timing as inventory levels came in, in 2020 in response to the pandemic-driven market conditions and then were built back up toward normal operating levels in 2021 and '22, where we elected to pay suppliers early to secure delivery of inventories during the supply chain disruptions.We're optimistic supply chain commissions will continue to stabilize in 2023, which should help to smooth some of the cash flow timing volatility going forward. Further impacting the year-over-year comparison, we began to see the projected increase in interest rates, which were $18 million higher in Q1 2022 and capital expenditures up $11 million over the prior year. Income tax payments increased $6 million in the first quarter, and we anticipate a larger uptick beginning Q2 when we have 2 quarterly estimated U.S. federal payments.As of March 31, we had total debt of $2.7 billion with a total leverage ratio of 1.6x EBITDA, which is comfortably inside our target range of below 2x. Our effective borrowing rate rose to 4.7% for the quarter due to the market rate hikes in the U.S. and Europe. We have $1.8 billion in variable rate debt, of which $700 million has been fixed with interest rate swaps of 4.6% and 4.2% over the next 2 to 3 years, respectively.In the first quarter, we repurchased roughly 100,000 shares for $5 million and paid a quarterly dividend totaling $74 million. As discussed in the Uni-Select call, we will emphasize debt repayments over share repurchases to reduce total leverage ratio prior to the closing date.I will conclude with our current thoughts on projected 2023 results. Our guidance is based on current market conditions and recent trends and assumes that scrap and precious metals prices hold near March prices and the Ukraine Russia conflict continues without further escalation or major additional impact on the European economy and miles driven. On foreign exchange, our guidance includes recent European rates with balance of the year rates for the euro of $1.08 and the pound sterling at $1.23. We will not include any results for the Uni-Select business until the closing date.Our full year guidance metrics on Slide 4 remain unchanged from the Q4 earnings call. We still expect reported organic parts and service revenue in the range of 6% to 8%, organic growth of 7.9% in Q1 includes an extra selling day in Europe, which we will give up in the balance of the year in addition to 1 fewer selling day in North America and Specialty in Q3.The first quarter per day figure of 7.1% is near the midpoint of the range. We still expect adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.90 to $4.20. As I mentioned, North America and Europe are performing ahead of expectations, offsetting the softness in Specialty and self-service, including precious metal prices and the higher effective tax rate.The free cash flow expectation of approximately $975 million and 55% annual EBITDA conversion remain in place, noting that a portion of the Uni-Select transaction fees will have a onetime impact to free cash flow and create a headwind. We will provide a full update on all guidance metrics once the Uni-Select transaction closes. Thanks for your time this morning. With that, I'll turn the call back to Nick for his closing comments.Dominick P. ZarconeThanks, Rick, for that financial overview. In closing, the first quarter was a great start to 2023 that again, validated the strength of our strategy, our business model and most importantly, our people. As we continue to progress through 2023, let me restate our key strategic pillars, which continue to be central to our culture and our objectives. First, we will continue to integrate our businesses and simplify our operating model. We will continue to focus on profitable revenue growth and sustainable margin expansion. And we will continue to drive high levels of cash flow, which in turn gives us the flexibility to maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy. And fourth, we will continue to invest in our future. As always, I want to thank the over 45,000 people who work at LKQ for all they do to advance our business each day and for driving our mission and our delivers values forward regardless of the challenges.And with that, operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.(Operator Instructions) Your question comes from the line of Daniel Imbro from Stephens.Question and Answer SessionDaniel Robert ImbroNick, I want to turn to the North American organic growth side. Obviously, really strong on a headline basis. I'm curious, were there any noticeable industry changes that drove that, whether it was a step-up in alternative part usage from State Farm faster than expected? Was there pent-up demand that got filled by the improved auction availability you talked about in the slides. Just trying to reconcile the big step-up on both a 2- and a 3-year tax basis for the organic growth in the quarter.Dominick P. ZarconeGreat question. Obviously, the demand in North America is ultimately driven by the need for parts to repair collision-damaged vehicles. We do that with both aftermarket parts and recycled parts. As disclosed, we are benefiting a bit from the price actions that we took last year. And so average selling prices are up a little bit, 2023 over 2022, but volumes are up as well.And that as I indicated in my prepared remarks, it's really driven by a couple of items. One is we finally have our inventories where we need them to be. And so fulfillment rates are back in north of 90% on the aftermarket product, which is terrific. And the State Farm program is starting to kick in. We talked about in the Q4 call that we thought that would be somewhere in the $80 million to $100 million benefit for 2023 for LKQ. We're right on track to hit that. That's what we built into our expectations for the year.And State Farm, we knew was not going to be like turning the lights switch on. It was going to take time for that to build and it's building. I mean the reality is APU for the industry in the first quarter was about where it was back in 2018 and '19, which is terrific. It obviously dipped quite a bit during the height of the pandemic and the shortage of aftermarket supply, but we're back to good levels of APU, which is terrific.We believe we're continuing to take share. And there are longer term, there are other metrics that bode in our favor. The cars are being built in a more complex manner. The average number of parts needed to repair a vehicle has increased by about 2.5 parts over the last 5 years. The average cost of those parts has gone up. And again, we think APUs are going to continue to drive north, particularly with the benefit of State Farm.And nobody is better positioned to capitalize on those trends than LKQ because we're the largest distributor of aftermarket collision parts in North America. We are the largest distributor of recycled parts, aftermarket -- or recycled collision parts in North America, the volumes on the mechanical side of salvage were off a little bit. And actually, the volumes on the collision side salvage were off a little bit in the first quarter, but that just has to do with the fact that we were -- during the height of the pandemic and the constraints within our aftermarket inventory, we were the only player in the market where we were able to shift a little bit of that -- those requests over to salvage parts.And we talked about that in our past calls. And in this quarter, you got a little bit of that swinging back the other way. But we feel very good about how we're positioned in our North American operation. We believe that the future is bright. The growth is good. And we're going to go continue to take as much share as we can get.Daniel Robert ImbroI appreciate all that color, Nick. And maybe I'll stay on North America with the little margin. Just clarifier. I think the North American margin over 20% was good to see. You got a 80 bps of a tailwind from freight in the quarter. I would assume you guys have locked in some of those. So would that kind of tailwind continue? And then similarly to follow up on what you just talked about with growth staying so strong. Would maybe your expectations for North American margins to be higher this year than we talked about a few months ago, just given growth is coming in faster than expected?Rick GallowayYes. I appreciate the question, Daniel. So good question. You're spot on. So during part of the prepared remarks, I talked about our expectations for the year will be elevated for our North American operations with the 20.5% EBITDA that they delivered, just fantastic results from the team. Some of that will come back through pricing, as we talked about, but we're comfortable saying we'll be within the 18s now. And we were guiding a little bit lower than that, if you recall, a couple of months ago as we were going to finish out the year, we don't think we'll finish out the year near as low as that.And it's really -- as you start thinking about that freight, that freight -- when we looked at that year-over-year, there was a pretty significant increase in freight in Q1, and that sort of went away starting in Q2 last year. And so year-over-year, there's a pretty nice benefit. That benefit almost goes away when we look at Q2 as we had already locked in some rates, and there wasn't this excess freight is what we call it here, there was excess freight on the ocean deliveries that really kind of mitigated when we got into Q2. So still good results. I expect those to continue, but we will see a little bit of a tightening, but not near as much, Daniel.Daniel Robert ImbroGreat. Well, congrats to Justin and everyone on the team and a good luck going forward.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan from Jefferies.Bret David JordanSwitch over to Europe now. Could you talk about the 8.2% growth per day sort of breaking it out on price and units? And then as a follow-up to that, you called out Benelux, Germany and Eastern Europe as very strong. Could you sort of give us some performance spread to the U.K. and Italian business? And maybe talk about the cadence that you saw in the quarter as it progressed.Dominick P. ZarconeSure. We are thrilled with the performance of our European business, again, on a per day basis, over 8%, 9% on a reported basis. As I mentioned in my prepared comments, every geography was either in high single digits or low double digits. And we haven't seen a scenario like that for quite some time. Again, we called out a couple of the higher performers being Benelux, Germany and Central and Eastern Europe.But that doesn't mean that the rest of the team underperformed. Indeed, they were in that high single-digit area. And it was a mix of price and volume. Again, when inflation hit hard, we did the best we could to get ahead of the curve because if you don't, inflation will eat your life from the inside out. I'm so proud of the efforts by our teams over the last couple of years to make sure that we were able to get ahead of that.But there was some good volumes comparisons. And look, the first quarter of 2022 was a good quarter but wasn't off the charts, and so we had a pretty good comparison to go after. And we're optimistic that Europe will continue to produce good solid results. Again, we're not anticipating 9% growth for the entire year for the European team. So it may come in a little bit as we move through the next few quarters as the organization really picked up some momentum towards the back half of last year.The cadence through the quarter, I mean, there was -- we don't give monthly results, but it was solid and the second quarter is off to a decent start albeit we're 20 some days into the quarter, and we still got a long way to go. What we're particularly pleased with our European business, Bret, is the margins. Margins are up 90 basis points from where they were in Q1 of last year. And the revenue growth is great. We want to bring that down to the bottom line because (inaudible) revenue doesn't do anything for an organization. And the reality is, we've got the best margins in the European theater. When you look at it on an apples-to-apples U.S. GAAP to U.S. GAAP basis, nobody has our level of EBITDA margins, and we're very proud of that.Bret David JordanGreat. Yes, it's looking good. And then 1 last question on the specialty business. Obviously, sort of similar cadence question, but starting to see some maybe softening in the U.S. consumer. Could you talk about the trajectory of that business through the quarter?Dominick P. ZarconeYes. I mean it started off the year soft and ended the first quarter soft and that's why we've been very upfront with the same. We're not expecting any great turnarounds for the back of the year, and it's going to come in below our original expectations and what was in our original guidance that we set back in the February call. We don't see any particular catalyst.And again, all part types are not equal. As we mentioned, the softer product lines include RV, what's, no pun intended, but what's attached to the RV volumes is towing product, think about hitches and the like because every time somebody goes to get a brand new RV, if it's a towable, they need a hitch on their truck or their car, right? And so when new unit sales go down, demand for towing product goes down. And so those are 2 product categories that are softest. The traditional SEMA product and the performance products, again, are down a little bit year-over-year. We think that's just the fact that they were so high in 2021 and 2022, but not down nearly as much as our RV product set.And then as Rick indicated, Marine is actually up a bit, which is terrific. Important is that the specialty team is not taking it all sitting down. They've got a lot of programs, particularly focused on productivity. They're adjusting the footprint, their footprint of what they do. They -- we've already consolidated our fab tech California operation into our Fab 4 South Carolina operation. So we're going to save some money there. We have dramatically reduced inventory in that business to really align the working capital, along with the current and anticipated revenue trends.We sold a very small underperforming business to the former owner. But at the same time, this market in Specialty is going to provide us some opportunity to probably make a couple of small tuck-in acquisitions that will go a long way to helping create and broaden our competitive moat in certain geographic or product markets. And we're going to take advantage of that.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Brian Butler from Stifel.Brian Joseph ButlerJust kind of going back to North America and maybe Europe too, just kind of on the larger trends of driving activity. Maybe some color there. Just how that's playing through on the results, on the volumes as well as was there any benefit kind of from the winter weather? Or was that even a -- maybe a headwind meaning it was so mild?Dominick P. ZarconeNo. I mean miles driven is kind of just basically moderating along. There's no material growth -- no material declines. As we've said in the past, we have better statistics on that in the U.S. than we do in Europe. But overall mobility has not changed dramatically on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter.And the reality is that's fine. We really got pinched obviously back in 2020 when the pandemic hit is when the literally mobility around the globe came to a grinding halt. And as long as vehicles are on the road and people are using their vehicles to get to and from work, fuel prices have come down generally on a global basis. They're not all the way down to where they were pre pandemic, particularly in Europe. But they've moderated a bit, and we think that's always good. Lower fuel prices tend to lead to perhaps a little bit more miles driven and that creates demand for our parts. Again, we're assuming that the rest of the year that we're going to be kind of a flattish environment from an overall mobility perspective.Brian Joseph ButlerOkay. That's helpful. And then my follow-up, can you provide maybe a little bit more color just in Europe on the payables and inventory and kind of what trends you're seeing there and how that matches with the expectations?Rick GallowayYes, I'll take that one. Thanks for the question. So we're real pleased with the activity that we've had over in Europe, in particular, with the vendor financing program, but also in the overall payables, right? We started making sure we transition away from just talking about vendor finance and talk about overall payables. And what we were able to see year-over-year is that really a 10% improvement in our European operations on the days payable as we extend that. And there's still room to go. We would expect similar-type improvement this year and probably for the next couple of years. You got to think of it as not a race. We're not in a 100-meter dash here. We're in a marathon. It's going to be continuous improvement over and over again every year as we deal with our vendors and really train them in the extension of the terms. And so the team has done a great job. We got to see it. We got to see it in the free cash flow. We will see it again this year and continually improve even from Q4 to Q1, another improvement from what we've seen on there as well. And it's both pieces, right? So it's exactly where we're wanting to be, and we expect that to continue for the next couple of years.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Scott Stember from ROTH MKM Partners.Scott Lewis StemberCongrats on the very strong results. Going over to State Farm, obviously, things are cranking up nicely as expected and it's just on 2 or 3 SKUs. Are there any signs that, that SKU count will increase, whether it's radiators or fenders or door panels?Dominick P. ZarconeYes. So we knew that the decision by State Farm to begin to turn on aftermarket products, like I indicated, was not going to be flipping a switch over on the wall to turn on the lights, right? It was going to be evolutionary, not revolutionary. And the volumes are ramping up to our expectations. There have been no discussions about adding additional parts.State Farm has not done anything, put out any statements, made any comments publicly about expanding the program. To be sure, every time we talk with our folks at State Farm, we are continuing to encourage them to both accelerate the rollout of the existing parts and to add new parts to the program. But the direct answer to your question is there has been no material movement coming out of Bloomington, Illinois with respect to broadening the part types.Scott Lewis StemberGot it. And then last question, just going back over to specialty. You talked about the RV repair side. I know that you guys are pretty well entrenched with the OEMs to handle their warranty business. Are you seeing increased demand for just wear and tariff types of items? And how would you expect that to offset the general softness in the segment?Dominick P. ZarconeYes, you're correct. We do -- most of the distribution of warranty parts for not every OE, but most of the OEs, which is terrific. As you can appreciate, the first quarter of the year is not a high utilization point with respect to RVs because not a lot of people are using their campers north of the Mason-Dixon line in January and February.It's a little chilly outside. We do expect that, that activity will begin to ramp as to whether gets warmer and people really get out to the camp grounds to utilize their units. And we think we're incredibly well positioned. We're making sure that we've got the right inventory to service those types of requests for warranty parts. And we're going to be standing ready to support all of our OE customers in that regard.Scott Lewis StemberGot it. And then just 1 last question back over to North America. You were talking about loss rates and as these higher-priced used units, I guess, work their way through the auction process. Can you talk about where you expect loss rates to be? Are we hitting a bottom here? Are we hitting a point where we could see an inflection in actual repairable claims going up?Dominick P. ZarconeYes. In our discussions with the industry groups and the folks who have all the data on the collision industry and total loss rates and the like, their expectation and our expectation is total loss rates for 2023 will settle out somewhere in the 18% to 19% range. They were 19% in Q1 as car prices -- used car prices moderate a little bit, that's going to fluctuate around. But their expectation, our expectation is somewhere in the 18s for 2023. And we'll pilot that. And again, the 19% in Q1 was up a little bit from last year, and it had no impact on our growth. As we've said over and over, we've lived through almost every cycle as it relates to total loss rates. And we just, no pun intended, we drive right through that.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Craig Kensington from Baird.Craig R. KennisonRick, I wanted to follow up on your fulfillment commentary. I think you said fulfillment rates were back above 90%. Can you give us a feel for that rate in Q1 of last year. And do you expect each quarter in 2023 to benefit from a similar lift in fulfillment? Or does the benefit fade as the year unfolds?Rick GallowayYes, Craig, I appreciate the question. As we look at the fulfillment rates, last year, we were in the upper 80s. We finished the year in the upper 80s. We started off really around 84 for the first quarter last year. And then as we progress through the year, it gradually kept getting better and better and better. We're still up versus Q4's number as well. So we finished in the low 90s, but a slight improvement.And our expectation is that, that will continue to etch up just a little bit throughout the year. So we're really pleased with the inventory availability. If you think about last year, particularly in Q1, inventory was not very available for us. And we think we missed out on some share with OEs and the drop in APU. And then that's come back in Q1. And so the team is doing well and the inventory position we're very happy with in our North American operations.Craig R. KennisonAnd then could you comment on European fulfillment rates? Are there similar trends there given that in some cases, you share same dynamic?Rick GallowayYes, it's in the 90s. I mean that 1 didn't drop like we saw over here in North America. So still in the 90s and really pleased with our delivery performance out there.OperatorAnd this concludes our question-and-answer period. Mr. Nick Zarcone, I turn the call back over to you for some final closing remarks.Dominick P. ZarconeWell, as always, we greatly appreciate your time and attention in spending the hour with LKQ. We're very proud of the first quarter. We're optimistic about the future, not just here in 2023 but for the next 25 years as we continue to celebrate the first 25. And we look forward to chatting with everyone in about 90 days to announce second quarter results. So thank you.OperatorThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

You can skip our detailed analysis and head straight to the list of 10 Countries With the Highest Standard of Living in 2023.To judge the quality of life for any country, the standard of living is one of the key indicators to look out for. While various factors contribute to the standard of living, like social services, education, and healthcare, it is often economic stability that is considered a major determinant. In this article, we will explore countries with the highest standard of living in 2023 and the study factors that contributed to their success.Deteriorating Global Economic CrisesLiving conditions in 90% of the world's countries worsened in 2021, according to the UN Development Program (UNDP). Moreover, the Human Development Index (HDI), which evaluates a country's health, education, and living standards, has witnessed a global decrease in these factors for the first time in its 32-year history. The trend has been observed for two consecutive years, particularly affecting regions such as Latin America, the Caribbean, Sub-Saharan Africa, and South Asia. As a result, progress towards the 2030 Agenda's Sustainable Development Goals has been significantly reversed, with human development levels regressing to those of 2016.In 2022, the economy of Europe and Central Asia witnessed a significant decline in their growth rate fueled by the Russia-Ukraine crisis, rising inflation, and the tightening of monetary policy and financial conditions that severely impacted private consumption, investment, and trade. Moreover, the increased food and energy prices resulted in inflation rates reaching levels never observed in the last two decades.For 2023, the anticipated growth rate of regional output for Europe and Central Asia has increased to 1.4%, much higher than the last forecast of 0.1%. The economy in the region has been observing a positive trend, although it remains severely affected. Story continuesThe improvement may have been caused by the less severe contraction of the Russian economy with a stronger and prosperous outlook for Ukraine. The region's average growth rate is expected to reach 2.7% over 2024-25, as inflation gradually subsides, domestic demand improves, and the external economic environment recovers.Countries around the globe, developed or developing, face grave economic challenges that directly affect their living standards. According to the World Bank's estimates, Turkiye was hit by two severe earthquakes on February 6, 2023, which caused direct damages amounting to around $34.2 billion, equivalent to 4% of the country's 2021 GDP. According to the National Institute for Economic and Social Research (NIESR), Britain is expected to be safe from recession in 2023. Still, its living standards will be hurt due to a surge in inflation, making it hard for some to pay their bills. The GDP growth forecast has been downgraded to 0.2% from 0.7%, with a further decrease to 1.0% in 2024. NIESR predicts that one in four households will need financial help for food and energy. Companies that promise improved living standards Despite depressive times globally, some public companies aim to contribute to improving living standards and quality of life for millions of people through different practices.For example, Procter &amp; Gamble Co (NYSE:PG) is dedicated to creating a water-positive future through sustainable practices and partnerships. Their ""River of Progress to 2030"" outlines their efforts to reduce water usage in manufacturing, innovate new solutions to water challenges, and support water restoration projects in 18 areas worldwide, including water-stressed metropolitan areas like Los Angeles. In a significant move amidst a global economic crisis, Novo Nordisknovo (NYSE:NVO) announced that it will reduce insulin prices in the US by up to 75% for individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes in January 2024. This is certainly a major step towards reducing the financial burden on patients and improving access to healthcare that may save the lives of thousands of people.Moreover, to elevate the social standing of women while addressing the issues of intersectionality, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) aims to have 50% of women in management positions globally, to achieve 35% ethnic and racial diversity in management positions within the U.S. Additionally, the company plans to grow the number of Black and African American employees in management positions in the U.S. by 50%.Trends in the countries with the highest standards of living in 2023A common trend observed in the countries with the highest standard of living in 2023 is that they have one of the most educated populations in the world. For example, Japan stands out for its strong education system, with many young adults holding tertiary qualifications.In 2021, 65% of 25-34 year-olds in Japan held a tertiary qualification, compared to the OECD average of 47%. While Japan spends less than the OECD average on pre-primary education institutions, the Japanese community still has a solid focus on the education sector, with 34% of funding coming from private sources.Another common trend observed is that most countries on the list have democratic governance systems with fair and free elections. According to an analysis conducted by Acemoglu, a professor at MIT, countries that transitioned to democratic forms of government in the last 70 years experienced significant economic growth. The study, which looked at 184 countries from 1960 to 2010, found that countries such as Portugal and South Korea saw a 20% increase in GDP per capita within 20 years of adopting democracy, on average. The findings suggest a correlation between the establishment of democratic governments and economic development.25 Countries with The Highest Standard of Living in 2023Boris Stroujko/Shutterstock.comMethodologyThe method utilized to compile the list of the 25 countries with the highest standards of living in 2023 involved two primary metrics, the Human Development Index (HDI) from the UN and the overall rankings for the Best Countries, as determined by US News. The rankings derived from the HDI and the Best Countries lists were averaged to generate an aggregate score, subsequently utilized to rank and identify the top 25 countries with the highest standard of living in 2023. Using standardized metrics allows for a comprehensive and data-driven approach to evaluating the living standards of the top 25 countries.25.

Reported EPS is $1.37, expectations were $1.32.Operator Good morning, and welcome to Procter &amp; Gamble's Quarter-End Conference Call. Today's event is being recorded for replay.This discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&amp;G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections.As required by Regulation G, Procter &amp; Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter &amp; Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends, and has posted on its investor relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.Now, I will turn the call over to P&amp;G's Chief Financial Officer, Andre Schulten.Andre Schulten Good morning, everyone.Joining me on the call today are Jon Mueller, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.Execution of our integrated strategies drove strong results in the January to March quarter. Organic sales grew across all 10 categories in -- and in six out of seven regions. Global aggregate market share is holding steady, productivity savings are accelerating and enabling sustained investment in the superiority of our brands.In-market execution across all five vectors of superiority is strong and consistent: product, package, communication, go-to-market and value. Superior offerings continue to pay benefits for our consumers and retail partners and in turn for P&amp;G shareholders.Progress against our plan enables us to increase guidance for organic sales growth and cash return to shareowners, and to maintain guidance for core EPS growth and free cash flow productivity.Moving to third quarter numbers. Organic sales grew more than 7%. Pricing added 10 points to sales growth and mix was a modest positive contributor for the quarter. Volume declined 3 points, including a 1 point headwind from portfolio reduction in Russia.Growth was broad based across business units with each of our 10 product categories growing organic sales. Feminine Care was up low teens, Personal Health Care, Home Care and Hair Care each grew double digits, Grooming, Oral Care and Fabric Care grew high single digits, Baby Care was up mid singles, and Family Care and Skin and Personal Care grew low singles.Growth was also broad based across geographies with six of seven regions growing organic sales.Story continuesFocus markets grew 5% for the quarter. Organic sales in the U.S. were up 6%, including modest unit volume growth. Europe focus markets were up 8%.Greater China organic sales were up 2% versus prior year, as the market begins to recover from COVID lockdowns and as consumer confidence improves. We continue to expect further recovery as consumer mobility increases over the coming quarters. Longer-term, we expect China to return to mid singles underlying market growth rates for our portfolio of categories.Enterprise markets were up 15% with Latin America up nearly 30% and Europe enterprise markets up low teens. This is the fourth consecutive quarter in which all five sectors grew organic sales double digits in enterprise markets.Global aggregate value share was in line with prior year, with 30 of our top 50 category country combinations holding or growing share.Excluding Russia, global value share was up 20 basis points. In the U.S., all outlet value share was up 40 basis points versus prior year with eight of 10 categories holding or growing share in the quarter. U.S. volume share is up 90 basis points versus the prior year, driven by 2 points of absolute volume consumption growth in a market that is still down modestly versus prior year.Strong U.S. share growth in Personal Care has been led by innovation on the native brand and deodorants, as well as successful extension into body wash. Cascade Platinum Plus has driven strong share growth in auto dishwashing, and Dawn share continues to be up more than 1 point with ongoing leverage from the power wash and easy squeeze innovations. Vicks continues to be a growth leader in Personal Health Care, and we've delivered strong share growth in the Metamucil and Pepto-Bismol brands.In Europe, the new four-chamber Ariel Platinum PODS are driving strong consumer demand in Fabric Care.PG 58009547_ml Procter &amp; Gamble Corporate Headquarters.

The new GilletteLabs exfoliating razor, male and female intimate grooming innovations and cardboard packaging upgrades are driving strong growth in grooming.Moving to the bottom-line. Core earnings per share were $1.37, up 3% versus prior year. On a currency neutral basis, core EPS increased 13%, good progress as we faced $0.31 per share of cost and foreign exchange headwinds in the quarter.Core operating margin increased 40 basis points, as 150 basis points of gross margin expansion were partially offset by SG&amp;A investments and inflation impacts. Currency-neutral core operating margin increased 160 basis points. Productivity improvements were a 290 basis point help to the quarter.Adjusted free cash flow productivity was at 92%.We returned $3.6 billion of cash to shareowners, approximately $2.2 billion in dividends and $1.4 billion in share repurchase.Last week, we announced a 3% increase in our dividend, again reinforcing our commitment to return cash to shareowners. This is the 67th consecutive annual dividend increase and the 133rd consecutive year P&amp;G has paid a dividend.In summary, against what is still a challenging cost and operating environment, continued good results across top-line, bottom-line and cash for the third quarter. Our team continues to operate with excellence, executing the integrated strategies that have enabled strong results over the past four years and that are the foundation for balanced growth and value creation.A portfolio of daily use products, many providing cleaning, health and hygiene benefits in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice.Ongoing commitment to and investment in irresistible superiority across the five vectors of product, package, brand communication, retail execution and value, we are again raising the bar on our superiority standards to reflect the dynamic nature of this strategy.Productivity improvements in all areas of operations to fund investments in superiority offset cost and currency challenges, extend margins and deliver strong cash generation, an approach of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future.Finally, an organization that is increasingly more empowered, agile and accountable with little overlap or redundancy flowing to new demands seamlessly supporting each other to deliver against our priorities around the world.There are four areas we are driving to improve the execution of the integrated strategies: Supply Chain 3.0, digital acumen, environmental sustainability and employee value equation.These are not new or separate strategies, they are necessary elements in continuing to build superiority, reduce costs to enable investment and value creation and to further strengthen our organization.Our strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization are interdependent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other. When executed well, they grow markets, which in turn grow share, sales and profit. We continue to believe that the best path forward to deliver sustainable top- and bottom-line growth is to double down on these integrated strategies, starting with the commitment to deliver irresistibly superior propositions to consumers and retail partners.Now, moving to guidance. As we work towards the end of the fiscal year, we are cautiously optimistic.We remain confident in our strategies and the organization's ability to execute them with excellence. We continue to expect more volatility in the macro and consumer environment, and expect sustained pressure in costs and foreign exchange as we move forward.On the whole, our consumer markets remained relatively resilient, with U.S. and China volume trends improving, but with inflation pressures in Europe weighing more heavily on consumption. We continue to think the strategies we've chosen, the investments we've made and the focus on executional excellence have positioned us well to manage through this volatility over time.Raw and packaging material costs, inclusive of commodities and supply inflation, have largely stabilized over the last few months, but still remain a significant headwind versus last fiscal year.Based on current spot prices and latest contracts, we now estimate a $2.2 billion after-tax headwind in fiscal '23.Foreign exchange is also a significant year-on-year headwind and rates since last quarter have moved modestly against us. Based on current exchange rates, we now forecast a $1.3 billion after-tax impact to the fiscal year.Freight costs have moderated throughout the year, and we now expect them to be roughly in line with prior year.Combined headwinds from these items are now estimated at approximately $3.5 billion after-tax, or $1.40 per share, a 24 percentage point headwind to EPS growth for the year.In addition to these impacts, we are also facing higher inflation in wages and benefits and higher year-on-year net interest expense.We are offsetting a portion of these cost headwinds with price increases and productivity savings. We are continuing to invest in irresistible superiority and we are investing to improve our supply capacity, resilience and flexibility.As noted in the outset, our strong results over the first three quarters have enabled us to raise our organic sales outlook and confirm our guidance ranges on EPS and cash. We are increasing our guidance for organic sales growth from a range of 4% to 5% to approximately 6% for the fiscal year. This would put fiscal '23 in line with 6% top-line growth we've averaged over the last four years, which were 5%, 6%, 6% and 7% from fiscal '19 through '22, respectively.On the bottom-line, we're maintaining our outlook of core earnings per share growth in the range of in line to plus 4% versus prior year.Significant headwinds from input costs and foreign exchange keep our current expectations toward the lower end of this range. This guidance also reflects our intent to remain fully invested to drive our superiority strategy and increase investments as we value -- as value creating opportunities are available.We continue to forecast adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90%. We now expect to pay nearly $9 billion in dividends and to repurchase $7.4 billion to $8 billion in common stock, combined a plan to return $16 billion to $17 billion of cash to shareowners this fiscal year.This outlook is based on current market growth estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruption, major production stoppages or store closures are not anticipated within this guidance range.To conclude, we continue to face highly volatile consumer and macro dynamics.We also continue to see high year-over-year input costs, inflation in the upstream supply chain and in our own operations. Headwinds from foreign exchange, geopolitical issues, and historically high inflation impacting consumer budgets. As we said before, we believe this is a rough patch to grow through, not a reason to reduce investment in the long-term health of our business.We're doubling down on the strategy that has been working well and is delivering strong results. We continue to step forward. We remain fully invested in our business. We remain committed to driving productivity improvements to fund growth investments, mitigate input cost challenges and to deliver balanced top- and bottom-line growth.With that, we'll be happy to take your questions.See also 20 Biggest Power Generation Companies in the World and 16 Largest Grocery Chains in the World.Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions]The first question comes from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.Please go ahead.Lauren Lieberman Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to talk a bit about productivity, because over the last, I guess, two-and-a-half, three years during the pandemic and all the global supply chain challenges, productivity was something that understandably took a back seat. And then, this quarter really seen this significant change in what you've been able to realize. So, I was curious if there is -- if we should be thinking about productivity of something where there's, like, a catch up, where there's sort of projects that have been on the list, things you were able to get at, so that productivity could run at an elevated rate going forward? And it's also interesting I think in the context of marketing, how you've been so consistent in investing throughout?There's actually no catch-up on the marketing piece. No need to accelerate reinvestment per se, but maybe some, again, acceleration on the productivity side. So, I'd be curious to hear about that. Thanks.Andre Schulten Great. Good morning, Lauren. I think, as you said, we are catching up right now to return to gross savings levels that are equal or close to equal to those that we've delivered pre-COVID. We have more line capacity available for us to qualify cost savings or mind space of our teams to be able to identify new opportunities. And as we are able to engage suppliers and get through this inflationary period, hopefully, more ideation and new projects to be created as well.As we've talked on our Investor Day, we see runway on productivity for the next few years, driven by Supply Chain 3.0. We have talked about delivering about $1.5 billion of savings with those initiatives between automation and digital capabilities.And we continue to believe that we can generate between $400 million to $500 million a year from media, programmatic savings both in terms of scheduling and buying capabilities around the world. Those programs will hold productivity, in my estimation, close to pre-COVID levels, which will allow us to continue to reinvest in media, which will allow us to fund innovation and superiority, and that is really the intent of the model.So, to answer your question directly, I would not expect a disproportionate catch up, but I would expect a steady return to pre-COVID levels of net structure savings, both the cost and media.Jon Moeller I agree.Operator The next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Please go ahead.Bryan Spillane Thanks, operator.Good morning, everyone. I actually had just one clarification and then a question. The clarification, the $125 million of, I guess, incremental interest expense, can you just give us a little bit more color on that? And again, is that something we need to kind of contemplate in our models as even we look past the fourth quarter? So, I guess, is net interest expense going up?Andre Schulten Yeah, morning, Bryan. Yes, I mean, obviously, it is, right? Markets are getting more expensive in terms of credit and we are not immune to that. So, the $125 million [BT] (ph) we've quoted for this year, I would expect the trend to continue to go up into next year. Now we are still well positioned relative peer group because we're able to borrow not only in the U.S., but also in euro, in pounds and in yen.So that keeps us very competitive. But nevertheless, we're not immune to those increases, so they will continue to go up into next year.Jon Moeller And just one piece of perspective there, Bryan. This is Jon. We've understandably, because it's been the primary driver of cost increases, focused our discussion on commodities. But that's not the only cost increase that we're seeing. We've just talked about interest expense. Andre mentioned in his prepared remarks, wages and benefits, which continue to increase. So, I would just encourage us all to gain confidence from what's happened here, but to realize that there are still, as Andre said, many headwinds that we're working against and we'll continue to work against as we move forward through next fiscal year.Operator The next question comes from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.Please go ahead.Dara Mohsenian Hey guys, can you hear me?Andre Schulten Yes, we can.Dara Mohsenian So, on the gross margin side, you were up significantly year-over-year in the quarter for the first time in a couple of years. Obviously, some nice sequential progress with the outsized cost savings and the strong pricing, but also your full year commodity assumptions and freight assumptions are a bit better than they were previously. So, just wanted to get a sense if we start to see this sustained improving gross margin environment, what's your perspective on the bias to sort of reinvest that upside back into marketing versus let it drop to the bottom-line? This quarter, obviously, with the magnitude of gross profit upside, you could do both.But just want to get a sense on how you think about that going forward?And if I can slip in a second part, are you comfortable you're getting a strong ROI on the higher ad spend? Presumably, obviously, you did this quarter, but how do you think about that going forward and sort of ROI on any spend that may be opportune or incremental to what you originally expected?Andre Schulten Good morning, Dara. We would expect progress on the gross margin side. Actually we're encouraged by the productivity numbers that have helped us on top of pricing to deliver the first modest increase in gross margin after a very long period of heavy cost headwinds impacting us to the negative side. And as we've done this quarter, we will continue to look for value creating opportunities to reinvest.We firmly believe the reason why we are able to grow the top-line at the range we are growing, the reason why we are able to hold volume share and value share globally in a very tough environment is because of our superiority-driven innovation across product, package, communication and retail execution.And we believe that as pricing goes into the market and the consumer is even more, I think, sensitive towards the value equation that they are being offered, continued investment across all of those vectors is going to create value and serve us well going forward. So, we will maintain the flexibility to do so, but we will do it in a disciplined and in a very ROI-driven way as you say.As to your second part of the question, as ad spending becomes more efficient with our ability to in-house both scheduling and buying of media, more digital capability to be more targeted, that increases the ROI of every dollar we can spend. So, it actually makes investment in media spending more attractive. At the end of the day, we will maintain the concept of balance between top-line growth, bottom-line growth and cash generation to stick with our ongoing growth model and value creation model.Jon Moeller Just building on Andre's points, which I fully agree with, I want to come back to this notion of balance and our commitment to it.Some of you have heard me talk about this probably many times, but it's worth repeating, so you understand how we're thinking about things.We have a chart that we use with the leadership team every time we gather, which shows what you would have to believe to deliver top total share shareholder return, which is our objective entirely through the top-line or entirely through the bottom-line. And to do it entirely through the top-line, you'd have to assume that we can grow 8% from an organic sales standpoint each and every quarter, which is in our view unrealistic. If you try to do it entirely through the bottom-line, you'd have to assume that you could expand margins 180 basis points per year. So five years, 10 margin points in a highly competitive industry where it's taken us 187 years to build 22 margin points, equally unlikely.So, we are very committed to driving both top-line and bottom-line.It's the only way we see to get home. I have a trite little saying that we use on occasion, which is ""Top-line with no bottom-line, a waste of time. Bottom-line with no top-line, just a matter of time."" We're going to continue to operate in that vein. And if we're successful, you'll see top-line growth driven by proper levels of investment and bottom-line growth and margin expansion -- modest margin expansion.One last thing on the point of advertising rate of return, or ROI, in addition to what Andre was talking about, we simply have, though maybe hard to believe, a lot of low-hanging fruit that's out there. We have many categories where we are not at our target levels of reach. And that's a very high ROI activity when we can reduce wasted frequency, reinvest that into expanded reach, very good things happen.As you've seen, by the way, not just this quarter, but for the last four years. And there's no reason to change that approach at this point in time.Operator The next question comes from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.Steve Powers Hey, thanks, and good morning. So, overall volume this quarter came in roughly in line at least with our expectations, but both price and mix delivered upside, which I think implies just better structural elasticity than we were expecting. And I guess the question is, as you balance everything, just your relative confidence that, that can continue? On the one hand, you have some tailwinds for sure as China comes back and service levels seem to be improving, your reinvestment rate is admirable as we've been talking about.But there's obviously uncertainties out there. And so, I guess, maybe just a little bit of perspective on your overall confidence and where that confidence is more versus less elevated?Andre Schulten Good morning, Steve. I'll try a careful balance here between giving you perspective on the global basis and not letting you get ahead of yourself in terms of expectations. But the volume decline is better than we would have expected, as you said. Our elasticities remain favorable on an aggregate basis. And if you look at global markets, we actually see a volume consumption stabilizing. So, you would have seen in previous quarters global volumes across our categories down roughly 3 points to 4 points.In our most recent read, which is the past one month, volumes were actually down 70 basis points.This is market volume. And if you exclude Russia, probably more around flat. That's with China returning to some level of growth, and it's also with pricing moving into the base. So, we'll see as pricing becomes more annualized, we'll see that stabilization. I don't know if it's going to continue to be neutral. I would expect some level of negativity in terms of overall market volumes, but certainly improving sequentially.Within that, I think we're taking comfort in the fact that we are able to hold global volume share and global value share despite significant pricing that we have taken, which has enabled, as we said, we believe by our superiority strategy, a strong vertical portfolio, both tiers and price points and being present in all channels where consumers want to shop.In our biggest most important market, as we had in our prepared remarks, we were able to grow volume and volume share, 90 basis points over the past three months. So that's the positive side.On the negative side, Europe continues to be a high-pressure environment. We've been able to grow sales 8% in focus markets, but that it was a very strong pricing contribution with negative volumes in the range of 7%. And the European consumer is trading into private label. We see the price differential between private label and branded competitors increasing as private label is delaying price increases. The consumer continues to be under pressure there. So that's going to be a continued headwind, I think, from the volume side.Overall, I think our outlook is balanced.As we said, we expect market growth to return to 3% to 4% on the value side and there has to be a positive volume component to that going forward, but it will take a few quarters before we get there.Operator The next question comes from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Please go ahead.Kevin Grundy Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and congratulations on another strong set of results. I thought maybe we could spend a moment on China and the reopening there. Of course, given the importance of that market for you guys, being the second largest market behind only the U.S., so up 2% sequential improvement, which is encouraging, we see that in the China retail sales, including cosmetic continues to show sequential progress. You've been consistent about your target of mid-single digit growth for that market longer term.However, it also seems plausible that you potentially exceed that level of growth at least in the intermediate term here given easier year-over-year comps and then maybe the potential for some inventory rebalancing at retail as consumer demand improves. Can you comment a bit more on what you're seeing in China? And then, perhaps offer some broader views on the pace of the recovery, and how you see that playing out? Thank you.Jon Moeller Hey, Kevin. This is Jon. I'll hand it over to Andre to give some more numerical perspective. But I thought it might help just to share briefly the trip that myself and a large contention of our leadership team were able to make to China in the last three weeks. We spent more than a week there. It was wonderful to reconnect with our organizations, who are doing a tremendous job.We spent time in consumer homes. We spent time with our retail partner leaders in their stores and in their offices. And of course, we spent time with various government authorities.And without getting into all the details, the bottom-line conclusion was a very positive one, and much more than I was expecting even, and I'm kind of a China fan having worked there many years ago and having lived there. So, my expectation has already started high and those were exceeded.Having said that, and we talked about this on the last call, this is not going to be a vertical restart. And there will be a number of twists and turns, including some of the ones that you've mentioned along the way. As Andre said in his prepared remarks, we expect China to continue to contribute at a meaningful level over the middle- to long-term.But everything looks reasonably positive and constructive.Andre, do you have any other perspective on that?Andre Schulten No, I think you said it. I think the other component we're not yet seeing is any return of Chinese consumers to travel retail. That is a significant negative for us in the SK-II business specifically. So that, hopefully, we see a more positive trend there in the near future. That's the only other upside that I think we have. But as Jon said, I think the recovery at 2% organic sales in the quarter is very consistent with what we would have expected.Operator The next question comes from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.Robert Ottenstein Great. Thank you very much. Just a quick follow-up on -- or clarification on some of the numbers and then my real question.So, the clarification is I think you mentioned that mix was a positive impact on sales, but it was a slight negative drag on the gross margins. Just like to understand that.And then, my focus question really is, if you go into more detail on the U.S. business and the U.S. consumer, you mentioned that you saw an improving U.S. consumer. So, any kind of clarification around that? And then, an update on your pricing in the U.S., how much you saw in the quarter? How much more is there to go in the next quarter? And any kind of impact that you're seeing, any granularity on that would be appreciated. Thank you.Andre Schulten Good morning, Robert. On the gross margin and sales connection here from mix perspective, the effect that you're seeing here is product mix.So, consumers when they come into our P&amp;G portfolio, tend to trade up into higher-value items. We've seen that actually consistently over the past quarters. So that -- as they trade up into higher unit sales, that's a positive impact from a mix perspective on the top-line.But those higher unit sales items also have higher unit profit, but the gross margin in percentage is slightly lower for some of them. When you think about adult incontinence, for example, when you think about fabric care, single unit dose versus liquid detergent, gross margin percentage lower, unit sales higher, unit profit higher. So, it's a positive effect both from the top-line and the bottom-line standpoint, but the percentage mix is lower.U.S. consumer, I think is holding up well.As we said, any indication that we see on our business is that the consumer is still choosing P&amp;G brands. We are growing volume share in a market that is still down on volume. We are growing absolute volume. So, 90 basis points value share goes, 40 basis points value share goes fairly consistently across periods. We also see private label shares stable at 16%, really no movement here over the past one, three, six, nine months, which is a good indication that we don't see any material trade down.Now we're watching this very closely. And we believe that a lot of that is again driven by our very intentional strategy to drive superiority. We continue to invest in innovation. We'll continue to invest in product packaging innovation. We're increasing, as Jon said, communication frequency and reach where we see a good payout and return.Continue to work with our retail partners to ensure that the presentation of our brands online and in-store is as good as it can be. Last element I would call out is we are stable in terms of supply and on-shelf availability, which is also helping our overall position in the market. So, stable, I think is the characterization, but we're watching carefully.Jon Moeller And just one additional point, the 6% top-line organic sales growth that the team delivered in the quarter, and as Andre said, sales share -- value share growth and volume share growth, we still have a couple of categories where we are not supplying full demand. That'll be remediated here fairly quickly. But as you as you consider the strength of the U.S. consumer, if you look at those key measures, and realize that there -- while there are both opportunities and risks within the number, there are opportunities as well as risks, which continue to point to a relatively healthy U.S. consumption pattern.Operator The next question comes from Peter Grom of UBS.Please go ahead.Peter Grom Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone. So, I wanted to ask about the changes in the commodity and freight outlook. Second straight quarter that these headwinds have moved lower, which is nice to see. Can you maybe just give a sense what you're seeing within that bucket? Where are costs moving lower? Where are costs still sticky? And while I don't expect you to comment on '24 at this point, but maybe just conceptually how you see inflation evolving as we look out over the next 12 to 18 months? Thanks.Andre Schulten Good morning, Peter. Freight is relatively stable at this point in time, as we've mentioned in the prepared remarks. We expect our freight and transportation and warehousing costs to be roughly in line with prior year.And I think that is a reflection of a more balanced capacity situation with a driver to load ratio returning to, I think, more historical norms. Again, given fuel prices and all other dynamics, I wouldn't expect any major change going forward, but we're at least stable.From a commodity basket standpoint, we continue to see a mixed bag. We have some help in resin-based commodities. We have some help in pulp, though that is moderated by mill shutdowns for maintenance, both planned and unplanned. But on the other side, all our high--energy usage materials, when you think about caustic soda, when you think about ammonia, all of those are increased in pricing. So, the moderation is really limited and it's not consistent across the basket. So, $100 million after tax is the only thing we're seeing at this point in time.We also continue to see upstream in the supply chain.Our suppliers continue to try to recover their input cost increases, their labor inflation, and that continues to be a discussion that is ongoing. I think as we mentioned in CAGNY, some of those contracts roll over 12 months, 18 months. So, there's -- these headwinds and these discussions will continue to be with us. Overall, we're expecting, as we always do, spot rates will hold on, that's what's based and underlying our planning for next year and our guidance for this year.Operator The next question comes from Andrea Teixeira of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.Andrea Teixeira Thank you. Good morning. So, how should we think about the upside in Beauty? And both you Jon and Andre spoke briefly about travel retail being an upside in Asia. How should we be thinking also on the other side, lapping the triple pandemic and the respiratory benefit you had in healthcare?It seems you could benefit from digestive recently, but how should we be thinking about the other segments?And as we -- just a clarification. As we put in the embedded organic in the fourth quarter is a 4%. But it seems as if you are -- as Andre commented, the exit rate on your volume is potentially flat, bear in mind, of course, the potential risking in Europe. But should we be thinking more of a better quality in terms of the delivery in organic, so even though it would be a 300 basis points deceleration on a sequential basis, you'd still have better volumes, maybe flattish to maybe only slightly down and a 4% price component in there? Thank you so much.Andre Schulten Hey, Andrea.Andrea Teixeira Hi, Andre.Andre Schulten On the category specific questions, yes, we see SK-II as potential beneficiary of travel retail reopening.Overall, SK-II is recovering well outside of that channel. In China, Mainland, we saw 8% growth in the quarter. In Japan, we saw 46% growth in the quarter. But the overall results are still held back by travel retail. So, I think, we will see a sequential improvement, but there are many gives and takes in the overall Beauty Care sector. So that needs to be seen in context with a lot of other dynamics that are going on around the world.On the Personal Health Care side, we continue to be very pleased with the results the team is delivering there. And we see sustained growth in this space across respiratory, digestive, nerve care. There are many parts of that portfolio that have very high growth potential. And in some of these areas as we've talked before, we're still held back by supply constraints, which might provide upside in the future.But again, we have a combination of 10 categories across multiple markets.Some of them will do well in a period of time, some of them will be held back by negative headwinds. So, we continue to strive for a balanced top- and bottom-line growth picture. It will be driven by different parts of the portfolio over different times.From a volume versus price component standpoint, what is important to understand is quarter four, we will start to lap price increases for the first time. So, we had about 8% of pricing in the base. So that will be a negative headwind to the top-line growth in quarter four. And while we see stabilization of volumes, I would expect that there still will be negative volume component to the growth in the near future. We have still Russia portfolio being with us as a negative headwind. China is slowly recovering, but not yet in positive territory from a volume perspective.And as I mentioned earlier, the European consumer is under a lot of pressure with private label pricing not yet following the branded competition in those markets. So, pricing will come into the base. That will be a headwind to the top-line. I would expect there's still a negative volume component in quarter four.Jon Moeller Yes. One thing to remember too is that we've just taken pricing in both the U.S. and Europe. And I don't think that the data for the current quarter reflects a potential volume impact from some of that pricing. So, I would be looking at volume recovery -- volume to slowly improve over time, but it won't happen overnight.Operator The next question comes from Filippo Falorni of Citi. Please go ahead.Filippo Falorni Hey, good morning everyone.Thanks for the question. Jon, clearly you've gone through a lot of transformation over the past five, six years that the company bought from a portfolio standpoint, organizational standpoint, superiority. Can you help us understand how you think internally these changes can help you navigate a potentially weaker consumer environment if what we're seeing in Europe were to extend into the U.S. and some other parts of the world? Thank you.Jon Moeller Sure. And Andre may have some thoughts here as well. The -- what I really like about the strategic choices that we've made and the approach that we're taking currently is that it is the strongest approach I can think of. For a very healthy economic environment or a very difficult economic environment, the indicated actions don't change.So, think for example about our embedding in productivity as a fundamental part of our DNA. That's something that serves us very well. A positive economic environment as critical in a downward economic environment. The importance of superiority to consumers and categories where performance drives brand choice, critical in both a good economic environment and a difficult economic environment.Focus of the portfolio on daily use categories where performance drives brand choice and superiority within each of those categories across product, package, communication, go-to-market and value for consumers and customers, I just -- I don't see anything in that, that I would change if we have -- I mean obviously, tactically, there'd be some different decisions on the margin, but the broad underlying approach sets us up very well even if or particularly if we end up in a more difficult environment.Operator The next question comes from Olivia Tong of Raymond James.Please go ahead.Olivia Tong Great. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on pricing, particularly on the new pricing, whether your view in terms of elasticities relative to previous rounds of pricing have -- whether they've changed or stay similar to what you've seen already. And to the extent that you can draw some conclusions on markets where pricing is now starting to lap versus markets where you're still rolling out price hikes, can you just compare and contrast what you're seeing, especially since you're starting to see some modest volume growth in the U.S.? Thanks.Andre Schulten Good morning, Olivia. The most recent round of pricing have gone into effect just in February and March across -- and I'm calling out across Europe and U.S., because [those are somewhat] (ph) visible.So, it's hard for us, as Jon said, to determine what the outgoing elasticities are at this point in time. What I can tell you is that elasticities remain stable, remain favorable.And I think it is also a function of continued investment. It is a function of continued innovation. Every price increase or most price increases are connected to innovation, meaningful innovation for the consumer, that also guarantees retail support. They are linked to strong value communication. We've talked about Ariel Coldwater, Tide Coldwater, Charmin rollback, Olay value communication. And that is meaningful for consumers as they come under pressure. Many of our categories are categories where a consumer doesn't want a risk failure. You don't want to wash your clothes twice and you certainly don't want to deal with a diaper failure.So, all of that I think is helping us to maintain favorable elasticities across the board.The most important insight for us is -- and that's what you see us do in Q3, we need to continue that investment. We need to look for opportunities where our value is exposed, and I'll call out Europe as an example because of private label pricing at a lower pace than the branded competitive set. It is critically important that we maintain that investment level to maintain the value equation.Where we see pricing lapping or I think where we have the strongest portfolio and the strongest execution in terms of innovation and superiority, we see favorable results, and the U.S. is a good example of that. Excellent in market execution by the team compared with a truly strong portfolio and strong innovation is delivering both relatively strong results to the balance of market, but also driving market growth recovery.Operator The next question comes from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities.Please go ahead.Chris Carey Hi. Good morning. Can you just talk about your playbook in Europe? You've noted European private label is delaying price increases a number of times on this call. We've heard similar commentary from others in Staples. If price gaps in private label remain wide, do you simply accept that new level? Or you need -- do you need to do something about it to be a bit more offensive to close the gap? And I guess I say that in the context of Europe, of course, but also as a -- bit of a litmus test for price competition that could play out globally in month and quarters ahead, and just how you think about managing through that type of dynamic? Thanks so much.Andre Schulten Yeah. I'll start, Chris, and then I'm sure Jon will add.I think, the team is accepting the reality of an extended or expanded price gap versus private label as the challenge they need to deal with. And as Jon frequently says, we wake up every Monday morning and deal with the reality in front of us. This is a reality we need to deal with.So, what that means is we need to create innovation. We need to create product and packaging innovation, communication strategies and in-market executions that are able to provide value to consumers and retailers. And that's what we're focused on. I don't think that trying to eliminate the price differential is a meaningful and helpful strategy for us. But if we can generate growth via innovation and via superiority, that's both helpful for us and the market and the path forward we're choosing.Jon Moeller I couldn't agree more.And frankly, while Andre rightly points to a difficult consumer environment, if you look at our results thus far in Europe, they're very encouraging, not just in the last quarter, but through last fiscal year as well. We're achieving growth rates in Europe that are higher than we've seen in a long time. And so, now is not the time to back off. It's time to move forward and strengthen the execution, just as Andre described.That doesn't mean we have our heads in the sand. We've made several adjustments to price gaps, not just versus private label, but versus branded competition as we've gone through this period of pricing, and we need to continue to be sensitive to that. But first and foremost, we need to delight consumers and customers with the offerings that we're bringing to market and go from there.Operator The next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs.Please go ahead.Jason English Hey, good morning, folks. Thanks for just letting me in, and congrats on strong results. A couple of quick questions. So, first on pricing. Can you give us some more quantification on perhaps breadth than magnitude? And when you blend it all together, what sort of order of magnitude should we expect at consolidated level in terms of organic sales contribution going forward?And then, secondly, SG&amp;A, love to see the reinvestment back in the business. But really sharp sequential change both in terms of year-on-year for overall SG&amp;A and just sequential dollar step up. Can you unpack a bit more kind of where the money is? What's -- where the extra investment is going?Andre Schulten Yes, good morning, Jason. Pricing magnitude, the latest round of pricing is fairly consistent with what you would have seen in the past, but it's very tailored to the market as we said before.Mid-single digits, I think, is the ballpark I would give you for the latest increase. And I think pricing over time will move back to be a contributor to top-line, but not the sole contributor to top-line. So, we need -- and the market needs to find a balance here over the next few quarters to return to modest volume growth and pricing contribution to return these categories to mid-single digit growth. That's what we're working towards.On the SG&amp;A line, look, a lot of our reinvestment is driven by innovation timing, so when are the right initiatives in market to double down on. They are driven by pricing timing. So, when do we and can we support our brands as we take pricing and drive innovation. What I would tell you is the latest push we had as a management team to our earlier discussion was to really double click on our sufficiency in Europe and to see how high is up, what -- how hard can we push, especially the media and communication side in terms of value communication across Europe.So that's the one area I will give you where we paid a lot of attention over the last three, four months.Jon Moeller I would just add one thing. It's our category leaders that determine the level of investment that we're making at any point in time. And prior to this quarter, just as you go back in time, there were more situations where we weren't able to fully supply demand. And, obviously, those are situations that you -- you continue to invest in mental awareness and --- but not spike that investment, because you can't supply it. And as we get into an increasingly better supply environment as we did in the last quarter, you resume a level of spending now that you can fully support it. So that's a part of the dynamic in addition to the dynamic that Andre described.Operator The next question comes from Mark Astrachan of Stifel.Please go ahead.Mark Astrachan Yes, thanks, and good morning everyone. Wanted to ask sort of related two-part question more about U.S., but I suppose you could talk globally if relevant. How sticky do you think this strategy of irresistible superiority is in terms of volumes? Obviously, we see that you're gaining share if you look at the U.S. So, you're effectively trading consumers to higher-value products that work better than peer sets, right? So, it would suggest then there's a stickiness here that perhaps didn't exist in kind of prior cycles. So, I'd be curious how you think about that and how it flows through from a volume standpoint going forward?And related to that on just the volumes, what's your best guess as to why volumes are down from a consumer standpoint?Is the pantry destocking, unloading? Does that imply that they're potentially as reloading at a later time if and when consumer sentiment improves? Thanks.Andre Schulten Hey, Mark. I'll take the first crack. I think the concept of irresistible superiority is: A, dynamic and must-be dynamic; and B, is relevant across value tiers. So, as consumers get more careful with their spending for example, that just means we need to double down on our view of what superiority and some of our lower value tiers means.So, if you think about diapers in the U.S. for example, we have Luvs, which is about half the price of a Swaddlers diaper. And that means that we need innovation on Luvs, because we're now competing with private label and we need to make sure as consumers look for value, that brand can stand on its own from a product, packaging, communication and retail execution standpoint to provide value to those consumers.So, it's really not a strategy that by default drives trade up.It's a strategy that follows the consumer and is grounded in what the consumer needs and wants over time, so if we get more stress, that just means we need to double click on the type of innovation and investment we need.From a consumption standpoint, as pricing goes into the market, we generally see consumers reacting with what you've described. If there are pantry inventories available, they, for a period of time, draw down those inventories. And recall coming out of the pandemic, I think Jon mentioned this earlier, there were increased pantry inventories available across multiple categories. So, I think that's part of the effect that we've seen. I wouldn't expect any major restocking, because I think we're just returning to our normal levels.As supply stabilizes, it's kind of the COVID pandemic goes more into the past, I think consumers return to their normal behaviors.The other element we're seeing is more careful usage. If you're overall made aware of inflation in everyday media, every day, you look twice before you use another paper towel et cetera. And partially, that's part of our value communication, right? When we talk about Charmin rollback because the product is more absorbent and has more strength, we explicitly talk about the ability for consumers to use less.So, it's really driven in those elements. Again, I think the job that we have as market leaders in many of our categories is to drive volume growth back to sustainable levels. And there's many levers. We still have huge household penetration opportunities around the world in many of our categories.We can create new usage occasions, create regimen use across many of our categories. Those are the things we're focused on.Operator The next question comes from Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.Nik Modi Yeah, thank you. Good morning, everyone. I just wanted to follow-up quickly on China. Jon, maybe just given that you were there recently, just on the ground, consumer behavioral insights, like what are they going through right now? Are they just hesitating? And it's kind of like a choppy, ""Hey, maybe I'll check out, you know, outside and see if I get sick?"" I mean, just any perspective on kind of how the consumers actually behaving on the ground?Jon Moeller Yeah. You can imagine with what many of them have been through. There's a bit of a whiplash aspect to -- for three years, I was told that going outside was dangerous.And now I'm being encouraged to reemerge. I'm living probably in a relatively small dwelling, many times with multi-generations, and I don't want to negatively impact my family. So, there is a degree of hesitance and questioning. On the same time, there's an overwhelming feeling, at least as I experienced it, of liberation, of hope. And I was in Beijing one sunny Saturday afternoon, and the streets were packed. It was absolutely wonderful and joyous.So, I continue to hold on and believe in the mid- and long-term opportunities that China presents us with. It's certainly -- plus 2 is a lot better than a negative number that we had in the last couple of quarters. So there is clear improvement. But I think it'll be a little bit choppy. And all it will take is a little bit of nervousness to stop the reacceleration of the growth.But I would -- my takeaway, Nik, is a positive one, but with near-term caution.Operator Our final question comes from Edward Lewis of Atlantic Equities. Please go ahead.Edward Lewis Yes. Thanks very much. I guess, I'll just cover a little bit of ground, but I'd be interested just on the enterprise market performance. Just looking in particular at Latin America, I think you said Andre somewhat 30% growth this quarter. And I think that'd be an acceleration around 20% in the first half. Assuming there's a healthy element of price behind that, but I'd just be interested here what's driving this improved performance in that region.Andre Schulten There is a very healthy element of pricing there like in every other region, because we're pricing not only for commodities but also pricing for foreign exchange rate exposure in all of these markets.I think the positive effect is the volume is holding much better than in some of our focus markets. The consumer strength is there. I think the overall strength of the brands is better than we've ever seen. In-market execution is better than we've ever seen. Retail partnerships are better than we've ever seen. So, all of that I think is contributing to a strong price component with a positive volume component and that drives the 30% results of Latin America.Jon Moeller Yes. Just for perspective, in our two largest markets in Latin America, Brazil and Mexico, as Andre is saying, we're seeing volumes high single digit. So, I don't want you to take away that all of the sales growth, as Andre has already said is pricing. It's a healthy combination.And I also need to give a nod to the team in Latin America who's just doing a fantastic job.Listen, I want to close-up with just a couple of comments and reflections. And the first relates to what we've been through and what I think it portends for the future. And then, I'll come in and talk a little bit more about the quarter that we just completed.But if we had a conversation three or four years ago, and you told me, ""Look, here's what's going to happen. We're going to have this thing called a global pandemic. People are going to die. Borders are going to be closed. You aren't going to be able to get to your largest markets and they aren't going to be able to get to you. You're going to have difficulty getting your colleagues into manufacturing facilities, innovation centers, sales offices.But don't worry, that's not all. We'll have the largest land war in Europe since World War II. The combination of foreign exchange and commodity cost inflation is going to wipe out half your earnings. You're going to see dramatic channel shift in some of your largest markets in terms of where consumers are doing their shopping. And when all that's over, you're going to find that it's difficult to get people to come back to work. How do you think you're going to do?""And my answer to that three or four years ago would be that, ""Wow, do you think you can grow top-line, bottom-line, deliver cash and return that to shareholders through all that?"" Without taking you through the details, what you know very well, that's exactly what this team has done.Over the four years that ended last fiscal year, they created $13 billion in incremental sales, $5 billion in incremental profit.Now, if you bring that forward and look at what happened, what they accomplished in the last quarter, broad based sales growth, sequential progress in shipment volume, value share, volume share, return to gross margin expansion, strong productivity savings, at the same time healthy reinvestments in the top-line and advancing our level of superiority a margin of difference, in-market growth, in-household penetration, if those are the kinds of things our investors want to see, they're there in spades in the quarter that we just delivered.Last point, I promise, but we've talked several times, both Andre and I, about the challenges ahead, and they're real.We will continue trying our level best to do -- to serve consumers, customers, each other, society and clearly shareowners. But it's going to be, just as it has been, a bit choppy. And we're taking a long-term approach here. And if there are choices that are right for the long-term that cause bottom-line difficulty in the near--term, we're going to make those choices. And we'll talk more about that as we approach guidance for next year.But if you're thinking across mid and longer periods of time, I think we've got a great setup here, a great strategy, a great set of capabilities that should enable us to serve all those constituents that I mentioned very effectively. But we're thinking about that in years, not quarters. Thank you very much.Andre Schulten Thanks, everyone.Operator That concludes today's conference.Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.]"

We’ve seen many companies in the realm come out and post better-than-expected results, with pricing power leading the way.In fact, several companies – PepsiCo PEP, Kimberly-Clark KMB, and Procter &amp; Gamble PG – have raised guidance following better-than-expected quarterly results, causing buyers to swarm as of late.Below is a chart illustrating the performance of all three stocks over the last month, with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs we can see, all three have displayed relative strength over the period, outperforming the market handily. Let’s take a deeper dive into each company’s current standing.PepsiCoPepsiCo reported earnings of $1.50 per share, handily exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by nearly 10%.

Earnings improved 3% year-over-year, whereas revenue saw growth of 4%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchImpressively, PG’s recently declared dividend increase reflects the 67th consecutive year that the company has increased its dividend. The company returned more than $2.2 billion in dividends to shareholders throughout the quarter.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchProcter &amp; Gamble raised its FY23 all-in revenue guidance, now expecting growth of 1% compared to FY22, up from a prior guidance range of down -1% to flat year-over-year.  In addition, PG raised its organic revenue growth guidance for FY23, expecting growth of 6% compared to prior expectations of 4% – 5%.Bottom LineStocks in the Zacks Consumer Staples sector carry a defensive nature, as these companies’ products have an advantageous ability to generate consistent demand in the face of many economic situations.And as seen by the quarterly results from all three companies above – PepsiCo PEP, Kimberly-Clark KMB, and Procter &amp; Gamble PG – consumers have had little issue forking up extra cash for their products.In addition to uplifting guidance, all three companies currently sport a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating bullish sentiment among analysts.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of value and dividend stocks and their performance in the past, and go directly to read 5 Value Stocks to Buy With High Dividend Yields. Value stocks trade at a price lower than their intrinsic or true value. These stocks are typically associated with companies that have solid fundamentals but are currently out of favor with investors, resulting in lower stock prices relative to their earnings, assets, and other metrics. Historically, growth stocks have beaten value stocks for the most part, however, value investment strategy has proven to be successful over the long term. Bank of America estimated that value investing has returned 1,344,600% since 1926, whereas growth stocks delivered a 626,000% return during the same period.The historical performance of value and growth stocks has varied over time, with periods of outperformance for each strategy. During years of high inflation, investors turn toward stocks with lower valuations and high dividend yields, which results in the solid performance of value stocks. Last year’s consistent interest rate hikes have given value equities their much-awaited comeback after underperforming growth securities for over a decade. According to a report by T. Rowe Price, the MSCI World Value Index outperformed its growth counterpart by over 20 percentage points last year. The report also mentioned that periods of high-interest rates create broader earnings growth in equity markets, resulting in a strong performance of value stocks.In one of our articles titled 11 Best Undervalued Dividend Stocks to Buy Now, we reported that value stocks surpassed growth equities by 18 percentage points in the first 10 months of 2022.Another report by Schroders revealed that periods of economic slowdown bode well for value stocks in the past. The asset management company gave a positive outlook on value investing and mentioned that value equities will outperform the broader market by 11.8% cumulatively over the next three years.Story continuesDividend stocks are also grabbing investors’ attention in addition to value stocks. Some of the best dividend stocks such as The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) are popular because these companies have rewarded shareholders with decades of dividend growth and have strong cash flows.13 Value Stocks to Buy With High Dividend YieldsImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur Methodology:For this list, we used the Finviz stock screener to identify dividend stocks with yields above 7%, as of April 26.

We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had a material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies lead us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is mostly variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Value Stocks to Buy With High Dividend Yields.  Suggested articles:14 Best Income Stocks To Invest In10 Best Auto Parts Stocks to Buy Now10 Cheap AI Stocks to Buy in 2023Disclosure.

560,d7b35ad2-71f3-3edd-acb5-e2730277d00a,PG,2023-04-28,Here is What to Know Beyond Why Procter & Gamble Company (The) (PG) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-procter-gamble-130001699.html,1682600401,STORY,['PG'],"[Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +5.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2.2% change. The Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry, to which P&amp;G belongs, has gained 5.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.P&amp;G is expected to post earnings of $1.32 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +9.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.4%.The consensus earnings estimate of $5.86 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +0.9%. This estimate has changed +0.4% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.33 indicates a change of +8.2% from what P&amp;G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, P&amp;G is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PG _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of P&amp;G, the consensus sales estimate of $19.92 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2.1%. The $81.15 billion and $84.95 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +1.2% and +4.7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryP&amp;G reported revenues of $20.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.5%. EPS of $1.37 for the same period compares with $1.33 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $19.3 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.01%. The EPS surprise was +3.79%.Over the last four quarters, P&amp;G surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.P&amp;G is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&amp;G. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

MillerThank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to today's call. Overall, I am pleased with our first quarter performance, which is in line with our expectations for the year. We saw a solid performance and progress across our key business priorities.Turning to our first quarter results. Our revenue performance benefited from the commercial actions started in 2022, which included leveraging our pricing actions. We delivered another quarter of overall organic revenue growth, growing 7.2% with secure information destruction increasing 11.8% and regulated Waste and Compliance Services increasing 5%. We are showing good progress on our quality of revenue initiatives that I discussed last quarter, which includes our commitment to expanding service penetration, improving customer implementation's velocity and deepening customer partnerships by developing enhanced customer solutions.In the quarter, gross profit margin expanded 130 basis points. Our actions on operational efficiencies, particularly in the areas of staffing and reduced overtime have helped us offset increases in other costs such as fleet and facilities, allowing revenue growth to largely flow through to gross profit.We continue to be encouraged by what we see being reported in the market with hospital staffing levels shoring up, return of elective surgeries and return to office trends. As a market leader in our core businesses, offering solutions and compliance support, we are well positioned to take advantage of these trends as they evolve.Our infrastructure modernization efforts, including existing and additional future treatment capacity strategically placed in key geographic areas, positions us well to support growth in our customer base. Further, we are pleased with our cash flow generation and strengthened balance sheet. With regards to our operational modernization efforts, our new incinerator under construction in Nevada remains on schedule to go live in early 2024. We also have 20 additional projects underway, which include new auto clogs and conveyance systems.Regarding our fleet modernization initiative, although vehicle deliveries remain behind schedule. To date, we have received almost 80% of our outstanding orders and anticipate receiving the remaining vehicles by mid to late summer. Looking ahead to the U.S. regulated Waste and Compliance Services ERP deployment, the team is currently immersed in testing and readiness preparation and we continue to anticipate deploying it in the second half of 2023.Now turning to debt reduction. We improved our debt leverage ratio to 3.05x, a 23-point improvement since year-end, and we remain on track to achieve our 3x debt leverage ratio in the first half of 2023. This is our lowest debt leverage ratio since 2015.Finishing with portfolio optimization. In April, we divested our operations in Brazil, which was our last remaining Latin America business for an investing cash outflow of approximately $28 million. This represents our 13th divestiture since 2019.I'll now turn the call over to Janet to review our financial results.Janet H. ZelenkaThank you, Cindy. I will start by summarizing our first quarter results. As noted on Slide 5, revenues in the first quarter were $684.3 million compared to $664.2 million in the first quarter of last year. Excluding the net impact of divestitures of $16.6 million and unfavorable foreign exchange rates of $10 million, organic revenues increased $46.7 million. Of this increase, secure information destruction organic revenue growth was $24.9 million and Regulated Waste and Compliance Services organic revenue growth was $21.8 million.As noted on Slide 6, Regulated Waste and Compliance Services revenues were $451.3 million compared to $452.6 million in the first quarter of 2022. Excluding the impact of divestitures and foreign exchange rates, organic revenues increased 5% in the first quarter.In North America, Regulated Waste and Compliance Services organic revenues increased $22.4 million or 6.5%, mainly driven by our 3 pricing levers, which include: pricing in existing contracts; new customer pricing; and surcharges and fees.International Regulated Waste and Compliance Services organic revenues declined $0.6 million or 0.7% in the first quarter. This decline was due to wage volumes compared to the first quarter of 2022.Secure information destruction delivered revenues of $233 million compared to $211.6 million in the first quarter of 2022. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, organic revenues for secure information destruction increased 11.8% mainly due to pricing and higher recycled paper revenues.In North America, secure information destruction organic revenues increased $24.3 million or 13.4% compared to the first quarter of 2022. Of this 13.4% growth, service revenues contributed 10.8% and recycling paper revenues contributed 2.6%. The service revenue growth was mainly due to our 3 pricing levers, including fuel and environmental and recycling recovery surcharges. Recycled paper contributed approximately $4.8 million more than in the first quarter of 2022, reflecting mainly higher SOP pricing.In International, secure information destruction organic revenues increased $0.6 million or 2.1% compared to the first quarter of 2022. This change was mainly due to pricing levers offsetting reduced volumes.Income from operations in the first quarter was $40 million compared to $5.9 million in the first quarter of 2022. The $34.1 million increase was mainly due to gross profit improvement of $16.5 million, primarily driven by revenue flow-through and lower selling, general and administrative expenses of $22.6 million, mainly due to lower adjusted items and bad debt expense. These were partially offset by a divestiture loss of $5 million.U.S. GAAP net income was $11.2 million or $0.12 diluted earnings per share compared to a net loss of $14.2 million or $0.15 diluted loss per share in the first quarter of 2022. The $25.4 million increase was mainly due to higher income from operations of $34.1 million, as I previously explained, partially offset by higher income tax expense of $5.6 million and interest expense of $4.1 million.Cash flow from operations for the 3 months ended March 31, 2023, was an inflow of $49.5 million compared to an outflow of $38.8 million in the same period of 2022. The year-over-year increase of $88.3 million was mainly driven by accounts receivable of $32.9 million due to an improvement in days sales outstanding, higher operating income of $30.8 million, lower annual incentive compensation payments of $22.3 million and other net working capital improvements of $2.3 million.Adjusted income from operations was $84.7 million or 12.4% as a percentage of revenues, up from $59 million or 8.9% as a percentage of revenues in the first quarter of last year. Adjusted income from operations increased 350 basis points as a percentage of revenues due to the following: one, gross profit flow-through of approximately 130 basis points, mainly due to pricing; and two, lower selling, general and administrative expenses of approximately 210 basis points, mainly due to improved operating leverage against higher revenues and lower bad debt expense.As noted on Slide 8, adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.49 compared to $0.32 in the first quarter of 2022. Excluding the impact from divestitures and foreign exchange rates of $0.02, the remaining $0.19 year-over-year increase was driven by $0.20 from gross profit flow-through, $0.01 from lower selling, general and administrative expenses and $0.01 from lower income tax expense and others. These were partially offset by $0.03 from higher interest expense.Capital expenditures for the 3 months ended March 31, 2023, were $36.4 million compared to $37.5 million for the same period last year.Free cash flow for the 3 months ended March 31, 2023, was an inflow of $13.1 million compared to an outflow of $76.3 million in the same period of 2022. As noted on Slide 9, the year-over-year improvement of $89.4 million was mainly due to higher cash flow from operations of $88.3 million. Our first quarter DSO, as reported, was 56 days compared to a DSO of 63 days in the first quarter of 2022. The difference was mainly driven by prior year timing of North America secure information destruction customer billing and collections.As shown on Slide 10, at the end of the first quarter, our credit agreement defined debt leverage ratio was 3.05x, and our net debt was approximately $1.45 billion. As Cindy noted, we divested operations in Brazil in April for cash consideration paid of approximately $28 million. The cash consideration included coverage of debt-like related long-term liabilities, which will be removed from our balance sheet in the second quarter. The transaction is expected to result in a second quarter divestiture pretax loss of approximately $100 million, mainly due to noncash accumulated foreign exchange adjustments of $72 million.In 2022, the business in Brazil was unprofitable, unfavorably impacted adjusted EBITDA margin by approximately 20 basis points on a consolidated basis. Also in April, we made substantially all of the remaining FCPA settlement payments, which totaled about $8 million.Our first quarter results were aligned with our full year 2023 guidance, as shown on Slide 11, and our guidance ranges remain the same. I will now turn the call back to Cindy.Cindy J. MillerThank you, Janet. Earlier this month, we had an opportunity to host a Single Leadership Summit, which was attended by over 300 leaders across our organization. This was an amazing opportunity to celebrate the progress we've made in transforming this business over the past few years and engaged and energized the team on advancing the next aspects of our journey. As always, I'd like to thank our customers, team members, the communities we serve and our shareholders for their continued trust in having Stericycle protect what matters.Operator, please open the line for Q&amp;A.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question today comes from Sean Dodge from RBC Capital Markets.Sean Wilfred DodgeYes. Congrats again on the great progress in the quarter. Cindy, maybe just starting -- if we can start with an update on the inflation or the cost backdrop. I guess this has been in pretty steady decline for 6 months now. What's labor been like? And how cost has been trending for trucks and supplies? I guess the surcharges and structure you have in place now, are those sufficient you think to continue offsetting all of this? Or are these not normalizing fast enough where you think there still needs to be some work done around maybe incrementing some of those out?Cindy J. MillerYes. Sean, thanks for that. That's a great question. Actually, what we are seeing is inflation, we still see it in -- and it's not equal across everything, but I'll give you an example. While we are starting to see some of our vehicles that we had ordered come in. So a little bit of supply chain ease, the one thing as we are seeing continued inflation is when we look at maintenance costs and we look at rental costs, they still are pretty elevated. So for us, that's something that really hasn't changed, and it behooves us -- we're going to be in much better state once we get that full vehicle fleet or vehicle order in. So that we kind of get out of the rental business and then we've got newer vehicles that will not have as much maintenance required.If you take a look at inflation rates that are in a lot of the leases for our facilities and a lot of other things that we signed, that came up for renewal during times when inflation was exceptionally high. If you want to say even Q1 of last year, when it broke a 40-year record high. So we still have leases that are going to continue with some of those pricings in there because you obviously signed them for a certain year period.And you had mentioned wages. I think the good news on wages for us is our staffing has stabilized. And as I've always said, with a stable workforce, you can start to make some efficiencies and that really, really drive some good thing. However, those -- that stability has come at a higher wage rate, kind of a run rate than we've seen. I don't see that getting -- we're not saying that's getting any worse. We're very pleased with where we are. But obviously, those continue to be in the run rate of the business. So overall, I think there are still some pockets where we're seeing some pretty strong inflationary pressure. But we'll see how that continues throughout the rest of the year.Sean Wilfred DodgeOkay. And then just clarifying on the contribution from the 2 surcharges, Janet, I think you said 130 basis point lifted gross margins in the quarter. My math would put that at about $9 million. That would be down just a little bit from the $10 million in the fourth quarter. Is that just because there was some pickup you captured early in last year? And so the $9 million would be incremental? Or why else would that decline sequentially?And then if we think kind of this you shifted the SOP schedule up again, I think that went into mid-February, so with that in place, how should we think about kind of surcharges those contribute incrementally in Q2 and maybe over the remainder of the year?Janet H. ZelenkaYes. So as you think about Q1 and our ability, we put surcharges in RWCS later in the year, and we didn't have any in the first quarter of last year to speak of in RWCS other than some existing legacy. And then we continue to modify the floors that are existing on the FID surcharge for paper and just continue to tune all our pricing levers that we had, which are 3 through last year. So what you're seeing is the benefit of all those levers hitting Q1 very solidly where we didn't have as many in place or -- and some were not even existing in Q1 of last year. So sequentially, you're going to get noise just based on what's happening in the scheme of things. But we're really pleased that the sustainability of the surcharges. And as we go forward in the year, you will see that we're going to lap some of that pricing that we put in the market and particularly in the second half of the year. So that's why the first quarter is looking that strong in that surcharge range.OperatorOur next question comes from David Manthey from Baird.David John MantheyAlong the same lines here, when you think about approximate contract pricing, so the other 2 levers beyond surcharges, when we think about the 5% organic growth in RWCS, approximately how much do you think is related to those new contracts that are priced higher? And when you think about that -- those 2 levers of pricing, I assume some of that carries through the year. You probably have additional actions through the year. Does that remain constant or move up or down?Janet H. ZelenkaYes. So if you look -- I'll just start with -- if you look at our 3% to 5% growth rate for the year, we are reiterating that and that's because you're going to stop some of the pricing actions. However, we continue to leverage both of those prices levers, which is renewal. And also at the beginning of the year, the CPI that we put in contracts, renewals, the higher packing and continue to tune surcharges according to what we see in inflation. I'll turn it over to Cindy if she has any other...Cindy J. MillerYes. I think on the RWCS side, David, it's important to note. As we had said, Q1 of '22 was a very difficult quarter for us. If we take a look, I mentioned the inflation. We had tremendous staffing issues. They were just major supply chain disruptions. And really, we were still kind of getting our sea legs from the ERP deployment in Shred. So that's -- while that's on the Shred side.On The RWCS, I think as we move throughout the year, a positive note, I think, is the return of elective surgeries as we move through. So this won't be purely -- our plan is not to have purely be a price story, which this year's Q-over-Q turns out to be as such, simply because we didn't have those pricing levers in Q1 of last year. But we see and we're very encouraged by the return of elective surgeries. Now all hospitals don't rebound at the exact same time. However, we built into this year's plan, the thought that surgeries would come back. So for us, it was a positive sign that we're seeing there. And I think RWCS is well positioned to continue to hit the plan for end of the year.David John MantheyOkay. And second, Janet, when we just ask about long-term EBITDA margin targets, you would tell us that most of the free cash flow improvement you expected to see was due to higher profitability across the P&amp;L. And then we can back into EBITDA margins of low to mid-20s. Does that math still hold for the changes that have happened in the business as well as the adjusted free cash flow targets that you moved last quarter? Just trying to get a read on ultimately where we're headed.Janet H. ZelenkaOur long-term outlook stays the same as that I issued in February. Does that answer your question? So it is, yes, 13% to 17% adjusted EBITDA growth rate, which drives those higher margin rates and the free cash flow conversion rate of 50% to 60% with the following then and through 2027. And then an annual CAGR of 3% to 5% in revenue growth. So those are all...Cindy J. MillerYes, directionally, you're definitely, yes, you're on track.David John MantheyYes. Sounds like it's in the same ballpark.OperatorOur next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer.Scott Andrew SchneebergerFor first question, I guess want to focus on regulated waste organic growth acceleration look good. How did that compare to your internal expectations? What were some of the drivers and then kind of separately as an add-on, on that theme? What are you expecting out of used paper prices? Just going forward, what are you seeing on that trend? And Janet, maybe now commentary on what percent the surcharges cover on that?Cindy J. MillerYes. Scott, this is Cindy. I'll take the first part of your question. So I think we're pleased with RWCS. We are on track with our internal expectations. But again, I want to say if we look at Q1 of this year versus Q1 of 2022, everybody, not just Stericycle, everybody woke up to over 9% inflation. And it takes a little bit for anybody's pricing machinery to be able to implement if you're going to -- if a company is going to make any changes. It takes a little bit of time, whether it's contractual language, whether it's sitting down to figure out exactly where are the costs coming from, how are you -- what's the best strategy moving forward.So our year-over-year, Q1 versus Q1 comparison is certainly skewed heavily towards price on both the shred and the RWCS side. However, we built that in for this year. Our plan is -- we plan on delivering which is why we reiterated our guidance in terms of what we're going to grow on 3% to 5% write down through with adjusted EPS, free cash flow, et cetera.So I think overall for us, it was a good execution quarter for us in terms of not looking at it compared to a weaker comparison, but looking at it internally, we're pleased -- we believe we've made some solid progress on good key priorities and certainly driving towards making this year's goals.Janet H. ZelenkaYes. And in terms of the coverage of the paper surcharge and where we see paper rates go and I'll start with the paper rate. So we updated our footnote in the guidance, to say, we looked at the recent paper trends as we look forward. And we still kept our guidance range as the same, which means that we're able to manage that. And the reason we're able to manage what we're seeing is a recent decline from our original SOP paper rate is the ability of the surcharge to cover at least 50% of that on a revenue basis as it goes down. And when that shows up on the service revenue versus the paper revenue, whereas where price shows up.Cindy J. MillerYes. And I think, Scott, one of the other things, I'm not quite sure if this was also what you were asking. It still works out to be about 90% -- let's say, 90% is a service fee-based revenue stream and about 10% is from the RISI rate from the surcharge -- from the RISI rate itself.Janet H. ZelenkaAnd times the volume of the paper.Scott Andrew SchneebergerOkay. I want to touch briefly on the divestitures and just kind of inorganic profile. So Brazil being the last in Latin America, just curious commentary, what should we expect on divestitures going forward? What inning are you in? What would be left there? Any consideration on acquisitions at this juncture of tucking anything in. I realize you have a lot going on going into the summer, but just touch on the inorganic side.Cindy J. MillerYes. Scott, great question. I think for us obviously, we've said core is the Shred business as well as RWCS. We continue to look at all the markets and take a real good market analysis as to where is our opportunity not just to grow but to grow profitably in terms of our expectations for us to really drive the company forward to hit the long-range plans. You're right. We've had 13 divestitures since 2019. However, we've also had one acquisition. That's why we changed portfolio. We changed it. It originally come out as a portfolio rationalization, and we started the engine of divestitures. But then we morphed it to optimization because we realize that a couple of things had to happen and it started with we had to get a stronger balance sheet.Once you get a stronger balance sheet, one you get more control of the financing, you have greater flexibility. So for us, we continue to evaluate all of our opportunities. I think we've showed a pretty strong track record in terms of certainly the divestitures, but even the acquisition, which has been contributing nicely. So for us, I think we continue to have portfolio optimization as one of our 5 key business priorities for a reason. So to your point, we are looking and evaluating everything.You did bring up one very good point though, Scott, that I think is important to note. As we come into Q2, we are looking to deploy the larger portion of our business on ERP for the second half of this year, which means starting in Q2 as you start training, as we start getting into that rhythm before you flip a switch, many of our people who already are doing great things, working very hard, they will now start to take on 2 jobs. If I look at the engineering department, if I look at a lot of the operators, if I look at a lot of the -- our IT folks, those folks have a great job right now, and they're working very hard. But that ERP deployment means Q2, they start to take additional responsibilities. And we start to borrow from Peter to pay Paul in terms of applying resources to the immediate at hand. So for us, whether it's acquisitions or divestitures, like you said, the group will be quite busy as we continue to move through the year.Scott Andrew SchneebergerThanks. Appreciate it. Great job on getting that leverage down to -- congrats on that.Cindy J. MillerScott, we appreciate that.OperatorOur next question comes from Scott Levin from Berenberg Intelligence.Unidentified AnalystSo I wanted to drill down on the pricing just a little bit more. I don't know if you can estimate for us how much of this is sticky versus temporary pricing that you think might have to be adjusted downward if we see inflation abate in a meaningful way over the next few quarters?Cindy J. MillerYes. Scott, that's a very good question, and we have been -- certainly, any time you put price increases into the market, whether it's in your base rates or whether you're looking at it in terms of surcharges and fees, you always have to look forward. You have to be able to say, hey, what's happening in the market? Where are we -- what's happened to customers?So for us, as we come into this year, what we're starting to do and what many companies do is you start to take a look at where is your base rate and figure out what's the adjustment that needs to be made with the base rate so that you're not necessarily just looking at surcharges and fees. You've got to be reasonable enough in there that you have flexibility throughout the year based off of what the market gives you to your point, hey, what's sticky and what isn't. I think as we continue to win new business and we look at growing the volume portion of the business that is in new sites. Remember, we measure volume in terms of actual, whether it's a ton of paper or a pound of waste. We also measure volume in terms of are we winning new customers? What is the volume of new customers we're bringing into the fold.So for us, we're starting a -- you've got to have a complex strategy that also helps combine what you're looking at and what you're selling at in terms of your base rates so that you can start to see what will the market bear moving forward outside of something that's based on whether it's the paper price or it's based on a fuel index or it's based on inflation. So I think key points for you to bring up, and I can tell you right now, while I can't give you the exact science to it, I can tell you it's something that we are looking at every day.Janet H. ZelenkaAnd I'd just add for -- in the secure information destruction surcharges, we have 2 that are fuel and the 1 that was paper that I mentioned early. Those flex with commodity prices, but we can keep tuning those based on -- and we keep penetrating the market based on those as well.Unidentified AnalystGreat. And I know you guys don't really focus on breaking down like the smaller customer side versus larger customer side as much. But I was wondering if you can say whether there's any meaningful difference in trends you're seeing between either of those categories of customers is my sense was that the hospital side was where maybe you were seeing more pressure, maybe that's improving a little bit more. But any more color you can provide regarding that customer segmentation would be.Cindy J. MillerThat's pretty insightful, Scott, in terms of how we look at things. We're looking at hospital accounts. So they're really big hospitals, the IDNs, the big networks. We are looking at national accounts the ones the doctors, the dentists, those type of offices that we see certainly in downtown. But then also in the rural parts. So I think what we are seeing is not all things, and I said this earlier, not all regions and not all areas of the country are equal. We're seeing some areas where some of the hospitals have shut down, some of their satellites, if you will. And I want to say kind of getting smaller and stronger.We are seeing some similar things with some of the independents. However, in terms of what are we winning and at what price are we winning. We're very pleased with the commercial organization and the rhythm that they have going right now really driving more metrics into the business, really driving more information that we're getting from the market based on the technology that we currently have and really making some better strategic regional decisions in terms of pricing for us to be able to win profitably.So I think we are maturing that process right now. And I would say, we're winning across the board in those 3 segments, specifically in RWCS, and I think that's attributable to really the maturity of the quality of revenue rhythm that we have going over these last few years.Unidentified AnalystUnderstood. One last one, if I can sneak it in. On the -- so the leveraging -- I don't remember if you had a target where you expected leverage to hit by the end of the year, anything along those lines, but obviously, the leverage has come down meaningfully. Just wondering if they're -- on the capital return side, I'm guessing there's nothing to think about for this year maybe, but for next year. Is there any elaboration you can provide whether your thoughts on the capital program and whether capital returns may be in the offering for 2024, if not second half of this year.Janet H. ZelenkaYes, thanks for the question. So we were pleased with the 3.05. We did have a target to achieve 3x by the first half of the year with a chance of it in the first quarter then we came awfully close. So that was our target. So by the -- we still anticipate getting to that 3 or below by the second quarter of this year. After that, we're going to be focused on investing in ourselves through the rest of the year in the ERP deployment. We are -- so the free cash flow generation that we have will continue to be used to pay down debt or our capital program internally.As we get to 2024, we may have opportunities for other use of capital. As you mentioned, we haven't really refined that to a discrete menu, however, what would be on the menu, so as Cindy said, we've changed portfolio rationalization to portfolio optimization. So there's potentially opportunity for tuck-in acquisitions. And then, yes, you have the rest of the menu of options. And as we mature on that and get through this with our head down on delivering what we said we're going to deliver, those are options we'll have in the future to explore.OperatorOur next question comes from Tobey Sommer from Truist Securities.Jack WilsonThis is Jack Wilson on for Tobey. In terms of the 3% to 5% organic revenue guidance for 2023, how should we be thinking about the growth cadence for the remainder of the year with the Q1 growth and the return of electric surgeries built in?Cindy J. MillerYes. I think, Jack, welcome. It's nice to have you. We're looking forward to engaging with Tobey. But just I think a couple of things that we have to really temper and take a look at. We've got a major deployment for a technology system. Our ERP portion going in for RWCS in the second half of this year. So we've built a lot of things into this year's plan, but we believe that all things aren't equal, remember this quarter shows really big numbers in terms of revenue growth. But it's compared to probably one of the most difficult quarters, I think we may have faced in Q1 of 2022.So I think what's more important is what are we looking at for 2023. We see positive signs in terms of hospitals getting their, shoring up their staffing. We see positive signs in terms of people starting to go back for elective surgeries, remembering that it isn't the same for every hospital. It isn't as if a switch slip and now everybody is back. So -- but as the hospitals recover, we are well positioned to take advantage of that, knowing that as soon as we get into the second half of this year, really with the preparation in Q2 and then deployment in Q3, we've got a few other things that are going to be going on. While we continue to service the customers that we have. So a lot to the balance here. But I think a 3% to 5% growth in terms of the target is a good number for us to drive towards.Jack WilsonThat makes a lot of sense. Just maybe one on sort of the new facilities coming online in New Jersey and Nevada. How should we be thinking about the regulatory environment in terms of getting these facilities sort of completed and online?Cindy J. MillerThat's again. I think anytime anybody talks about regulatory and trying something past -- there is complexity there. But the good news for Stericycle is this is where we live. This is the arenas in which we live providing a very vital service to communities where all of our facilities and where we do our work.So for us, we're very pleased with the progress, specifically, if I could just mention McCarran. Just as McCarran, Nevada is going to be about 100,000 square foot facility. We're going to have 2 incinerators there. It's one of those where it is a waste energy plant. We're going to recycle all the water that's used to process the waste. So it will be a 0 process water discharge. It expected to be the cleanest mid-waste incinerator. And I think it's exciting for us to see things advance. And we've got a very strong public relations and public affairs team that right now are certainly working our operators to make sure that we're -- it's important not just to have a facility. You've got to make sure that you've got all the permitting, and we are well on our way to have that happen. So that we can have McCarran open some time in first half of next year.OperatorOur next question comes from Kevin Steinke from Barrington Research.Kevin Mark SteinkeIn terms of secure information destruction, you're about, I guess, 18 months out from the ERP deployment in that business. And just wondering what you're seeing in terms of your ability to drive new customer growth in that business. Maybe be based on insights you're gaining from the ERP. And just how also our returned office trends playing into the volume outlook and potential new customer growth.Cindy J. MillerKevin, that's a really good question with reference to the 18 months. So one of the things that I think we are very -- we're happy about. Any time people come back to the office, that's a good sign. I also have noticed, and I'm sure many of you have too that for everybody that's coming back to work, there is another company that's announcing some pretty big layoffs. So it isn't as if the world is looking anything 2019 yet. However, I think any time, as I said, folks come back that's great. The question was where are we in the -- with the ERP deployment. And here's what I think I'm most proud of.In that 18 months, we've gone from, hey, everybody, here's an issue, here's a bug in the system, let's fix it to now we are with the technology, we're now looking at all the enhancements that we can make, which is really that where you want to be in that kind of crawl, walk, run scenario. You start off fixing what bugs are in the system and then you figure out okay, this is running, you get it running smoothly. Everybody becomes comfortable with it. You start to understand data and then you see, all right, with this data.If I had this enhancement, I would get that much more granular and I'd be able to fix something, further upstream than what I can see right now. And I think we have moved from the fixing things into the enhancing things, really starting to leverage data. We're looking at everything from route rebalancing, certainly on the operations side. But then I think the other question you asked is, we are also now leveraging a good bit of that technology to improve the commercial rhythm, the sales rhythm.One of the things that you would have noticed is on quality of revenue, we talked about improving customer implementation velocity. Well, that really means from the time as an example in Shred, somebody signs up a customer. How quickly can I get out there to make that first service. When you're very manual, that can be very cumbersome and very labor intense. Right now in technology, that is affording us the opportunity to reduce that or speed up, I should say, to improve the velocity from the time of sale to the time where we're actually servicing a customer. So I think leveraging that ERP, we are hitting on the cylinders that we had outlined. And I still think that there's some runway for us to continue to improve.OperatorOur next question comes from Brian Butler from Stifel.Brian Joseph ButlerJust on the first one. I know margins aren't really broken out between the 2 segments. But when you think about in the improvement that you saw in the first quarter, any color we can see on how regulated medical waste or the SID kind of our trend? Are they moving apart? Or are they still kind of very close.Cindy J. MillerYes. So both are in the same range of margins, and they both are staying aligned in that range. So both are good margin businesses, and that's why we consider them core. And you're not seeing a divergence there. The difference is, it is a little bit more on cash because it is a lighter cash investment model than RWCS as we modernize it. So cash is -- both generate cash instead it's a nice contributor for our investment thesis that we're doing across both of our core businesses.Brian Joseph ButlerAnd then you talked about electrosurgery kind of improving in the back half and that was kind of built in. Do you have any color on the maritime activity and where that stands and how that fits into the guidance for '23?Cindy J. MillerYes. I think we're seeing -- any time that customers are coming back and taking cruises, it's good news for us. So I believe that -- and remember, sometimes that revenue has a hint of seasonality to it. But I think where we are internally with reference to maritime, we're very pleased in terms of the growth, in terms of the amount of crew ships that are out and running and our ability to continue to process it. So at maritime, it's good news story.Brian Joseph ButlerOkay. And then maybe my last one follow-up. I know you talked about the optimization of the portfolio, but I just wanted to make sure I understood. Is there anything really left outstanding any -- I mean, obviously, we're looking at all the time what fits best. But is there any big items that remain or really you pared down now to what you see as kind of the core?Cindy J. MillerBrian, good question. But unfortunately, not one that I'm going to be able to answer in terms of giving you specifics. This is the last thing that Stericycle would ever want to do would be to put out there something that is potentially that we're looking at on either an acquisition or a divestiture certainly prematurely. So for us, we just continue to look at the market. We continue to drive the accretive revenue. We continue to drive the commercial organization as well as the operations portion to work as efficiently and as they possibly can. So within those parameters, we've got a pretty good track record, and I think we're going to continue down that path. So apologies that I can't tell you anything more than that. But quite frankly, we've never really done that.OperatorOur next question comes from Michael Hoffman from Stifel.Michael Edward HoffmanYes. I apologize to double tune. We have 5 calls this morning, so we're overlapping. Following on Brian's question, I guess, you're not done. It's a fair answer, though. There's more to do. You won't tell us what it is. That's fine, but there's a little bit more to do.Cindy J. MillerI'd say it remains a key business priorities, Michael, so I appreciate you highlighting that. And good morning, by the way.Michael Edward HoffmanI'm drinking quarterly earnings out of a firehose this morning...Cindy J. MillerAs a matter of fact, when I heard Brian come on, I think that's where you work. So we appreciate you taking time to catch up with us.Michael Edward HoffmanThe other question, Nevada is going to come online next spring, but you've been moving waste around the country because to your credit, you closed Utah to manage the community relations. The volume had to move. What's that incremental cost for moving that? As I'm assuming you're bearing it?Cindy J. MillerYes. Well, I'll tell you, while we won't give the specifics in terms of the cost, I can describe it for you. Number one, the facilities that are all around, all on the West Coast are right now overburdened. So that's taxing equipment, it taxing our people in order to be able to continue to provide the right type of service. Number two, we've got third parties involved that we really want to be out of the third-party business. We've got that with reference to whether it's disposal capabilities, incineration capabilities, long-haul capabilities. So there's an awful lot of third party, which, quite frankly, has been quite expensive as we take a look at this last -- this last year or so. Good bit of costs have been flowing through that, that have been difficult.And then just our own long haul. Certainly, far a more long haul runs from the West Coast to different parts of the U.S. than we would then is optimum. So when McCarran comes up and running. And remember, a facility opens, you make sure everything works, you get the rhythm of the facility and then you start to build yourself up to capacity and capability. I like where this is positioned. I really -- we're very, very excited about not just what it's going to do -- certainly, what it's going to do for us internally. But for this being the type of facility that we're building, this is really going to set the model and the standard moving forward in the industry. So that's exciting.And then all the other facilities that surround this area on the West Coast, I think they're going to get a big sigh of relief, because sometimes you can push them too hard as well where they run beyond. They're not efficient either. So we get this facility online. I think we're going to see -- I think the operators are going to be very happy. But I think most importantly, our customers are going to be happy in the fact that we're going to be able to continue to grow and try to provide them terrific service.Michael Edward HoffmanSo just to be clear for everybody listening. In the first half of '24, a lot of that goes away, and therefore, having nothing to do with the ERPs and all that, you just open up a new facility and rebalance the operating leverage of the model for that alone.Cindy J. MillerYes. I think that's one of the things that we had looked at when we spoke to everybody about guidance and long-range plans and those types of things. We do have that taken into consideration in terms of opportunity. Just remember it isn't a switch flip. It all doesn't -- I think for everybody listening, it isn't a the door goes open and all of a sudden, everything goes away. We've got to work through some things. Again, it's a crawl, walk, run.However, the long-term outlook for us with that facility when we do get it all up and running, we do get rid of all the other contracts that we have with third party. We work on making sure that we rebalance the routes. We make sure that we've got our internal network going. That's a process. And once that's there, to your point, Michael, that's how we see our way to providing the long-term outlook that we did with some pretty good adjusted EBITDA, growth rates and some free cash flow conversion rates.OperatorThis concludes our Q&amp;A. I'll now hand back to Cindy Miller, CEO, for any final remarks.Cindy J. MillerThank you, Elliot. So to everyone listening to this call, we greatly appreciate your interest in Stericycle and your shared excitement in our future. So thank you very much.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, today's call has now concluded. We'd like to thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.]"

(Operator Instructions) Management will be available after the call for your questions that did not get answered during the Q&amp;A session today. I will now turn the call over to UDR's Chairman and CEO, Tom Toomey.Story continuesThomas W. ToomeyThank you, Trent, and welcome to UDR's First Quarter 2023 Conference Call. Presenting on the call with me today are President and Chief Financial Officer, Joe Fisher; and Senior Vice President of Operations, Mike Lacy, who will discuss our results. Senior officers Andrew Cantor and Chris van Ens will also be available during the Q&amp;A portion of the call.To begin, we started 2023 from a position of strength: steady demand from years of housing undersupply in the U.S., cycle-best relative affordability versus alternative housing options and embedded same-store revenue growth that was 3x higher than our historical average. Year-to-date results demonstrate this strength. Let me highlight those. One, our first quarter same-store revenue growth of nearly 10% and same-store NOI growth of almost 12% led to year-over-year FFOA per share growth of 9%; two, early second quarter trends across traffic, blended rate growth and collections are in line with our expectations, reinforcing the confidence we have in our business and guidance; and three, our balance sheet is strong, and we continue to adhere to capital market signals with our capital-light strategy. Our investment-grade balance sheet and nearly $1 billion of liquidity provide safety during the potential downturn and afford the opportunity to grow the company should our cost of capital improve.Looking ahead, there remains a wide variety of economic scenarios that could play out, but UDR has excelled across a variety of environments over our 50-year history. Our strategy is built around diversification, prudent capital allocation decisions and focusing on what we control to drive relative outperformance within the industry. These include: first, our leading operating platform continues to maximize the value of our communities and deliver a high level of resident satisfaction; second, innovation initiatives are, again, proving to be a differentiator versus peers and are a positive contributor to our growth profile in 2023 and beyond; and third, our diversified portfolio provides both safety and the ability to allocate capital across a variety of markets and investment opportunities that generate high risk-adjusted returns.Additionally, we benefit from favorable relative setups for the U.S. multifamily industry. Job and income growth have defied expectations and remain positive. Total housing supply is stable, and the level of future development starts has started to decline. And relative affordability versus single-family housing is as favorable as it's been in nearly my 22-year tenure at UDR.Taken together, I remain very optimistic on the relative strength of the multifamily industry and UDR's advantages within the industry. We have a strong culture, a talented team with a robust track record of performance, and we continue to invest in our associates and additional technologies. We expect to improve our efficiency, expand our NOI margin and create value for all UDR shareholders and stakeholders.In closing, I thank my fellow associates for your commitment to excellence and innovation, which I'm confident should continue to drive attractive, absolute and relative results. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.Michael D. LacyThanks, Tom. The topics I will cover today include: our first quarter same-store results, early second quarter 2023 trends and how they factor into our reaffirmed full year 2023 same-store growth outlook and an update on our continued innovation and operating efficiencies. To begin, strong year-over-year same-store revenue and NOI growth of 9.6% and 11.7% in the first quarter were driven by: first, blended lease rate growth of 3.5%, which was in line with our expectations and driven by above-average renewal rate growth of 7.4%; second, occupancy that held strong at 96.6% supported by healthy traffic; and third, rent collections continued to improve, with March being our highest level of in-the-month collections since the beginning of COVID.During the quarter, we remain focused on enhancing our rent roll and recapturing apartment homes that were previously occupied by long-term delinquent residents. The short-term effect of our approach had 3 direct results: one, approximately 400 basis points of higher annualized turnover versus the prior year, although 39% annualized turnover is in line with our long-term first quarter average; two, increased repair and maintenance expenses; and three, higher levels of availability during a seasonally slow leasing period and, therefore, a near-term drag on pricing.However, re-leasing these apartment homes to paying residents is beneficial to total revenue. Our efforts to date have reduced the number of long-term delinquent residents to approximately 300 or 50 basis points of total units, which is down from a peak of 750 and compares to our long-term average of 250. This, in combination with better in-month collections, helped to further reduce our bad debt reserve.Next, we continue to see favorable fundamental trends to start the second quarter. First, demand remains relatively healthy. Year-to-date job growth has been stronger than many had anticipated, and traffic is roughly in line with the elevated levels we saw a year ago and well above the long-term average. Second, the financial health of our residents appear to be in good shape as wage inflation has largely kept pace with rent growth, resulting in steady rent income levels in the low 20% range. In light of recent consumer spending habits and bank commentary, we continue to watch for signs of change, but affordability remains strong as only 10% of our first quarter move-outs were due to rent increases, which is down from roughly 18% at its peak during the middle of 2022. Furthermore, we have yet to see material evidence of residents choosing to double-up.Third, relative affordability remains in our favor. Renting an apartment is approximately 50% less expensive than owning a home versus 35% less expensive pre-COVID. Only 5% of move-outs in the first quarter were due to home purchase, which is roughly 60% less than our historical average. And last, concessions remain minimal and average approximately half a week on new leases across our portfolio. The concessions we have been offering remain primarily concentrated in certain submarkets of San Francisco, Washington, D.C. and our Sunbelt markets, with the latter a function of new supply being delivered to those areas.With this backdrop, second quarter blended lease rate growth is trending as expected and should average approximately 3%. New lease rate growth in April is approximately 50 basis points higher than March, though renewal rate has decelerated by 100 basis points. This convergence is in line with our expectations. Relating this to full year 2023 guidance, to achieve the 6.75% midpoint of our year-over-year same-store revenue growth guidance, full year blended rate growth needs to approximate 2.5%. With first quarter blended rate growth of 3.5%, we need to average only 2% blends for the duration of the year. We believe blends are anchored by renewal rate growth which, even during past downturns, was at least 2% on trailing 4-quarter average. In short, we remain confident in our ability to achieve the guidance we set in February.Turning to regional trends. On our last call, we anticipated that growth in our Sunbelt markets would continue to converge with the Coast and that Coast would have better growth results starting in mid-2023. That crossover occurred in the first quarter, slightly ahead of our expectation. While traffic remains healthy across all of our markets, the level of new supply being delivered to certain Sunbelt markets has resulted in higher market level concessions and has led to a pause in the ability to push new lease rate growth.Conversely, results and momentum in New York and Boston, which comprise roughly 18% of our same-store NOI, have been stronger than expected. Minimal levels of new supply and robust traffic led to 97% occupancy and portfolio-leading blended lease rate growth of more than 6% on average for these 2 markets in the first quarter. These divergent situations reinforce the value of a diversified portfolio across markets and price points. We will continue to take a balanced approach between rate and occupancy to maximize revenue and NOI.Finally, we are progressing with our various innovation initiatives, which will add to our bottom line in 2023 and beyond. Our high-margin, revenue-focused and tech-enabling building-wide WiFi project is expected to be rolled out across approximately 1/3 of our portfolio by year-end and our entire portfolio by 2025. We are making inroads on various resident-specific initiatives as part of our customer experience project that will enhance satisfaction, reduce resident turnover and drive greater pricing power.And we have advanced the integration of big data to enhance our pricing system. Over the past decade, our same-store growth results have benefited from approximately 50 basis point contribution from our unique initiatives. In this year, we expect the same. In closing, thanks to our teams for your passion in delivering best-in-class results to our residents and stakeholders. I'll now turn over the call to Joe.Joseph D. FisherThank you, Mike. The topics I will cover today include our first quarter results, a summary of recent transactions and capital markets activity and the balance sheet and liquidity update. .Our first quarter FFO as adjusted per share of $0.60 achieved the midpoint of our previously provided guidance range and was supported by strong year-over-year same-store NOI growth. The slight sequential decline was driven by higher average share count from the settlement of forward equity agreements at the end of the fourth quarter and higher interest expense, partially offset by incremental NOI from recently completed development communities.Included in our first quarter results was a $3.7 million onetime expense benefit due to a refundable payroll tax credit related to the employee retention credit program, which was previously contemplated in our original guidance expectations. Looking ahead, our second quarter FFOA per share guidance range is $0.60 to $0.62 or an approximately 7% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. The 2% sequential increase is driven by a combination of higher NOI from same-store, joint venture and recently developed communities. Year-to-date, results are in line with our initial expectations, and we have reaffirmed our full year 2023 same-store growth and FFOA per share guidance ranges.Next, a transactions and capital markets update. First, in alignment with our shift towards a capital-light strategy in mid-2022, we made no acquisitions, no new DCP investments and no new development starts during the first quarter. Second, during the quarter, we completed construction of a $145 million 300-apartment home community in Washington, D.C. With this, our current development pipeline consists of just 2 communities totaling 415 homes at a budgeted cost of $188 million, with 40% of this cost already incurred, thereby limiting our forward funding commitments. And third, during the quarter, we achieved stabilization on 2 development communities totaling 605 apartment homes for a cost of $142 million at a blended stabilized yield of approximately 7%. We also continued the successful lease-up at our 3 other recently completed development communities, which have an expected weighted average stabilized yield in the high 5s.Finally, our investment-grade balance sheet remains liquid and fully capable of funding our capital needs. Some highlights include: first, we have only $113 million of consolidated debt or approximately 0.5% of enterprise value scheduled to mature through 2024 after excluding amounts on our credit facilities and our commercial paper program. Our proactive approach to managing our balance sheet has resulted in the best 3-year liquidity outlook in the sector and the lowest weighted average interest rate amongst the multifamily peer group at 3.25%. Second, we have nearly $1 billion of liquidity as of March 31. And third, our leverage metrics remain strong. Debt to enterprise value was just 29% at quarter end, while net debt to EBITDAre was 5.7x, down nearly a full turn from 6.4x a year ago and 0.5 turn better versus pre-COVID levels. We expect these metrics to improve further throughout 2023.In all, our balance sheet remains in excellent shape. Our liquidity position is strong. We remain selective in our capital deployment with balanced forward sources and uses, and we continue to utilize a variety of capital allocation competitive advantages to drive earnings accretion. With that, I will open it up for Q&amp;A. Operator?Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Eric Wolfe with Citi.Eric Jon WolfeWe get a lot of questions from investors on sort of how supply is going to impact the Sunbelt later this year, just that there's more sort of cumulative impact from all the supply delivering. I guess as you look at your markets and project forward, do you see the Sunbelt diverging from the coastal markets later this year? Or do you think things will just keep trending together?Joseph D. FisherEric, it's Joe. Maybe I'll kick it off and then kick it over to Mike to talk about some of the trends we're seeing down there. But we've talked about seeing a pretty decent increase in supply as it comes to the Sunbelt. I do think our portfolio is a little bit more insulated when you look at supply growth within our submarkets. We have a little bit more of a B quality and suburban price point down there, so a little bit more insulation. But overall, I think Sunbelt for us has seen about 3.5% of stock. And so while demand has held up relatively well in recent years, depending on the macro outlook, if that does start to fade a little bit, you probably have a little bit more risk there as supply comes on. So Mike can probably give you a little bit more on what we're seeing down there.Michael D. LacyYes. Thanks, Joe. Eric, specific to current trends I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are seeing concessions start to pick up a little bit in the Sunbelt. That being said, we're not offering much there. Occupancy is still strong in that 96.5% range, and we expect that we'll be able to continue to push rents as traffic continues to increase on a month-over-month basis moving into the season.Eric Jon WolfeThat's helpful. And then unrelated question, but you're always thought of as being forward thinking on the technology front. And to that end, I was just wondering if you'd consider using your platform to help manage the back office of other companies' portfolios like one of your peers announced recently.Joseph D. FisherEric, it's Joe. It's a good question, a good thought. But I'd say when you look at our innovation, we've talked a lot about the 60-plus initiatives that we have out there right now that we're focused on, $40-plus million that we think will come in at a run rate here in the next couple of years. So for us, I think staying focused on what we can control, what's going to benefit the consolidated portfolio today and keep rolling out those initiatives, I think we want to stay laser-focused on that for the time being.OperatorNext question comes from Jeff Spector with Bank of America.Jeffrey Alan SpectorJust taking a step back, again, it's pretty amazing, the quarter you've had. We've been talking about this recession coming for over a year now and then just some of your comments on latest conditions and the health of the tenant. I guess from your seat on this recession, how are you thinking about this, just big picture? And is it possible that apartments or UDR's portfolio could be more resilient than what we've seen in the past during recessions? In particular, we're seeing a lot of white-collar job layoffs.Thomas W. ToomeyYes, Jeff, this is Toomey. With respect to a recession, I mean, I think they're all different shapes, forms, and how you get out of them are quite a puzzle to solve through history. But this one strikes me as a capital markets recession brought on by policy, lending patterns, capital flows. And so that's kind of unusual. Usually, it's followed by a rapid employment outlook change. And we're just not seeing it. And you've seen the first 3 months of the year, probably 4, all have positive job growth, which is a big driver of our business. So it feels like, to us, capital markets recession not impacting the jobs that severely. And if it does, it's going to be localized and we'll adjust accordingly. But it doesn't feel like the normal type of recession that has a heavy employment-based downturn.Jeffrey Alan SpectorAnd then if I can ask, and I apologize if I missed this, did you discuss how April leasing rates are doing so far, what you're seeing in April in various markets?Michael D. LacyJeff, let me take that. And I think it's important to just give you a few other points as we think about April. And I want to reiterate, we're on track with our initial guidance. The year is playing out as we expected as a whole. And again, we've said this before, guidance assumed 2.5% blends for the year. With our 3.5% in the first quarter, we only need that 2% for the remainder of the year, so just to kind of put that in perspective.As far as regions go, East Coast is still doing extremely well. We're seeing occupancy in that 97% range, blends in the 6% range in both New York and Boston. And then the West Coast right now is basically in line with our expectations, so we feel pretty good about the West Coast. Right now, Sunbelt is a little bit weaker than we would have expected. Still seeing pretty strong blends coming out of that part of the country, but that's a little bit off from what we originally had for our plan for the year.As far as April goes, though, it looks a lot like 1Q. Our blends are in that 3.5% range. We're seeing new lease growth continue to increase month-over-month. Our occupancy is in that 96.6% range, which is comparable to what we had in 1Q. Traffic is picking up based on seasonality, kind of where we expected. And we're sitting right now with less long-term delinquents than we've had in a very long time. So we feel pretty good about where our occupancy is today going into the season.OperatorNext question, Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets.Austin Todd WurschmidtYes. I was just curious, Mike, which markets saw the biggest moves in month-over-month improvement on new lease pricing April versus March? And then specifically on New York, I mean, how long do you think the momentum you saw -- how long do you think the momentum could continue, I guess, versus how it performed in the first quarter?Michael D. LacySure. Thanks for the question, Austin. Still seeing the most growth on the East Coast. And to your point, New York, it's coming down a little bit from those highs of 18%, 20% blends, but we're still seeing 6% to 8% today. So still strong, probably the strongest month-over-month today followed by -- I would tell you, Boston feels good as well as D.C. starting to pick up. And then the others are pretty much in line with where we were in March. New York specifically, I think they still have a little runway. We're still seeing a lot of traffic come to that market. No concessions to speak of, and with occupancy where it is today, close to 98%, we feel pretty good about continuing to push.Austin Todd WurschmidtThat's very helpful color. And then as it relates to potential joint venture, I guess, what's the latest update around the interest from potential partners and timing of announcements? I guess, has there been any change in sort of your initial expectation on pricing as it relates to just contributing those assets?Joseph D. FisherAustin, it's Joe. Yes, first off, I would say, obviously, we've got a great partner in MetLife. It's been a very good long-term partner that we continue to work well with, so no change on that front. Strategically, as we think about joint venture capital, I think we've talked about it in the past, on these calls and with investors, I think we've proven out over the last couple of years that we have a value creation mechanism in terms of the operational platform and its ability to add excess NOI margin to new acquisitions. And so we've proven that out, utilizing our own equity when that's available and priced right.But being a public company, we don't always have that capability. And so a joint venture would allow us the opportunity to be in the market throughout the cycle to be able to utilize dry powder sourced through a JV, through a seed capital, which would come at fairly efficient pricing, and be able to go out there and transact in this market and then go lift NOI and cash flow growth. So it does a number of things for us. You get the cash flow growth on the assets. You obviously get fee streams that enhance the incremental ROE on each dollar that we deploy. You're getting scale along the way as long as we continue to buy that deal next door and keep helping both the consolidated and JV portfolio.So overall, still strategically have a desire to do that. We continue to advance discussions on that. No update at this time. But on the pricing front, I think pricing today, plus or minus 5% cap rates, is kind of where the market has settled in. So I would hope to, if we do have something, be able to source capital at that level.OperatorNext question, Tony Paolone with JPMorgan.Anthony PaoloneJust following up on that because I think you just mentioned cap rates maybe in the 5s. I think last quarter, you said maybe the bid/ask was something in the high 4s to mid-5s. And so just wondering if you can talk a bit more about just what you're seeing out there in the transaction market and what your crystal ball looks like on how that evolves over the balance of the year.H. Andrew CantorTony, it's Andrew. I'll take that one. In general, as Joe said, we remain focused on a capital-light strategy at this point. We are having a lot of conversations and staying connected to the market, underwriting a number of deals. I think pricing is definitely more in that 5% to 5.25% range today. With us focusing on platform and the deal next door, if and when we get back in the market will be our focus and be able to utilize the benefits of our platform that have been discussed where we can add value from acquiring from other owners and operators and to layer on Mike's team and the platform that we've created.Anthony PaoloneOkay. And then just second one on the DCP book, I guess, somewhat related to allocating capital. I mean what's the comfort level and desire to kind of keep it at this level versus either seeing more opportunities out there to do more or even get paid back on what you have?Joseph D. FisherYes, it's a good question. I guess, as with everything within kind of our diversified platform, it's all things in moderation. So as a percentage of enterprise, we're about 2% of enterprise value within the DCP book. We've talked about a willingness to take that a little bit higher from kind of that $0.5 billion type of number. We have had actually JV discussions around that as well. We think that's an area that could be an opportunity for us to source alternative forms of capital and help expand that book and the ROE on those investments, but also not increase our exposure too materially. So it's an area that we're looking at today. I would say that the book of business available or the pipeline has come off quite a bit. You've seen a lot with, obviously, the regional banks pulling back on overall construction lending. You've seen it become more difficult to line up equity partners for new developments. And so our DCP book, being a byproduct of that, has pulled back. And so little bit less of a pipeline today which, for DCP deployment, not necessarily a near-term positive, but I think for overall fundamentals and the $1.6 billion of revenue, we have clearly a positive when you start thinking about a smaller supply pipeline going into the second half of '24 and into '25.OperatorYour next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo.James Colin FeldmanCan you talk more about what you're seeing in terms of urban versus suburban performance and the A versus B assets across the different markets?Michael D. LacySure. Specific to the Bs, we actually have seen a little bit more outperformance. So I would say, thinking about blends, probably 70 to 100 basis points more on the Bs today than the As. Occupancy has been relatively stable, around that 96.5% to 96.7%, both A and B, so not a big difference there. So I'd say right now, the price point on Bs is a little bit stronger, and that's kind of what we expected for the year.James Colin FeldmanAnd then what about like your urban assets versus your suburban assets?Michael D. LacyUrban's still doing a little bit better, and I would point specifically to places like Boston, D.C. for us today as well as SoMa in San Francisco. Those parts of those markets are doing a little bit better than some of the things on the outskirts. It's not materially different, but urban is a little bit stronger. We do expect that some of the suburban starts to bounce back midyear this year and probably converge, to some degree.James Colin FeldmanOkay. And then for my second question, what would you say is the key downside risk in terms of your same-store expense guidance, whether it's taxes, insurance, R&amp;M? And where do you feel like you have the least visibility right now?Michael D. LacyWe feel pretty good in terms of taxes and insurance today. I would tell you more on the controllable front, just with what we've seen with turnover, you have a little bit of pressure on R&amp;M. That being said, I think we've done a really good job with putting in place our technology around maintenance. We just rolled that out about 3 weeks ago across the entire portfolio. So we think we've got some things that can help mitigate expenses going forward there. We are starting to roll out more of those unmanned properties as we move into the season here, so that will help mitigate on personnel expense. And A&amp;M costs typically go with turnover, so if you have more evictions, skips, things of that nature, you could have more attorney fees. But it's minimal. So I'd tell you right now, turnover, to some degree, but we do believe we have it mitigated.Joseph D. FisherYes. And just to follow up on that, Jamie, a couple of comments. We've been asked a few times about kind of cadence of expenses. And so if you go back to 2022, first half of the year was about 4% growth, second half, 7%. So we're actually coming up on easier comps when we go into the second half of the year. A lot of that was driven by, one, it was very difficult to place personnel in the first half of '22 given the labor environment, so we had a lot more open positions that we're comping against here in the first part of the year. In response to that, we did do a lot of midyear raises throughout the portfolio, and so we'll be anniversarying against that by the time we get to the second half. Mike mentioned the turnover piece and we started to have more success with long-term delinquents in the second half of the year last year as well as definitely here in the first quarter and I think second quarter, so we'll start to see, hopefully, that mitigate to some degree.And then Mike mentioned the real estate tax insurance piece. Real estate taxes today, we generally know about 70% of that number for the year at this point, so don't expect a lot of volatility there. And on the insurance side, we do our renewal in mid-December. So premiums are relatively locked in here for most of the rest of the year at kind of a 20-plus percent number. The claims can be volatile. Claims making up about 50% of the insurance number. And so that's why you see insurance in first quarter actually being down on a year-over-year basis. Premiums were up but claims were down 30-plus percent as '21 and '22 were both running at pretty significantly elevated levels relative to history. So we're starting to see that come back to a more normal run rate.OperatorNext question, Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley.Adam KramerJust wanted to ask about capital allocation, recognizing kind of the capital-light strategy or the shift you mentioned earlier, I think you guys have been really -- have a really good chart in your deck and have shown a really kind of ability over time to kind of issue equity when you're trading above NAV and kind of sell assets to buy back shares when at a discount. Wondering how you're thinking about the buyback in that context. I think buyback was not mentioned in the supplemental. Just wondering how you're thinking about buyback kind of in current environment and at current levels.Joseph D. FisherYes. So clearly, we've been active in the past on buybacks. We did some in the second half of last year. We've done some in the previous years when we get to discount. So I'd say last year was a relatively easier decision given that we had previously issued equity on a forward basis in the first half of '22, up in the high 50s. And so you had an identified source of capital at a very compelling price, i.e., roughly a 4% cap, and we're able to buy back stock in the high 5s.If you fast forward to where we're at today, we are in a capital-light strategy. Sources and uses are relatively balanced with a relatively light forward development and debt commitments in terms of maturities. So I feel good on sources and uses. I think we do need to figure out where we would find and where we would price that additional source today if we did want to do a buyback. We talked earlier on the call about exploring joint venture capital. That could potentially create some dry powder for us to deploy and do both operating assets, DCP and potentially buyback. So that would be part of that discussion if and when we ultimately source some capital there. But right now, sticking to the capital-light strategy, it's something that we'll consider, but nothing there in the first quarter.Adam KramerGreat. That's super helpful. And just maybe switching gears, thinking about affordability. Maybe just talk a little bit about that. I know you guys have had some really good numbers in your slide deck historically. Maybe just whether it's kind of the latest moving data, affordability there and maybe even kind of tech tenants or tech employed tenant exposure, is there any kind of numbers around that you're able to quantify? I think that would be helpful as well.Michael D. LacyYes, I'll start, and Joe, you can clean me up here. But from what we're seeing, one thing I would point to is, just on the affordability aspect, people aren't moving out to buy homes. We are seeing right around 5% moving out to do so. That typically runs around 12%, so we're just not seeing much on that front. In terms of people leaving because of rent increases, that is around 10% today, significantly down from mid last year when we were around 18%. And so we're starting to see that come down to some degree as well. Not seeing people double-up. We always talk about how many people are in our units, still right around 1.8 and we're not seeing people transfer down to smaller units. So right now, it feels pretty good. Joe, anything you'd add to that?Joseph D. FisherNo.OperatorNext question, Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs.Chandni LuthraYou gave us some thoughts on the Sunbelt. You talked about the East Coast. Could you perhaps throw some color on the West Coast, particularly markets like San Fran and Seattle? What are you seeing in these markets from a pricing standpoint and then from a concession standpoint? Like, did things get worse in the last 2 months?Michael D. LacyIt's a good question. I've received a few of those lately. I'd tell you, again, the West Coast feels pretty much in line with what we expected. And I'll break it down a little bit for you, starting with the Pacific Northwest. Seattle for us, we're not really utilizing any concessions. That being said, market rents have been a little bit weaker than we expected going into the year. Market rents are starting to pick up as of late. And our occupancy is still in that 96.5% range. So Seattle feels good.I think specific to some of our submarkets, Everett, Kirkland, places like that, we saw around 10%, 11% growth. So we're seeing a little bit more strength out in the suburbs. Bellevue today, still relatively strong, no concessions, about 5% to 6% growth. So that's the landscape of Seattle. In terms of San Francisco, SoMa is still doing really well for us. We saw almost 14% growth during the quarter, and we're still seeing about a 2-week concession. That seems pretty average. We've had 2 weeks for about 18 months now, and it's just kind of par for the course, if you will. When you start to go down the peninsula, not really offering concessions today. Occupancy is in that 96%, 97% range. And we're still seeing pretty decent blends. So traffic is starting to pick up in San Francisco. Down along kind of the SoCal, if you will, L.A. has been very strong for us. This is a 3.5% NOI market, so relatively small, and our exposure is mainly limited to Marina del Rey. We've had a lot of success there. Occupancy is in that 97% range, no concessions to speak of and market rents continue to move up. So I feel pretty good about L.A. And then Orange County's been just steady as it goes, occupancy 96% to 97%, no concessions. Market rents continue to improve as we move into the seasonal part of the year. So right now, SoCal feels pretty good for us.Chandni LuthraGreat. And as a follow-up, could you discuss how the impact of eviction moratoriums ending in L.A. has played out for you? Like, what portion of delinquent tenants paid back all their past dues in full? What portion just decided to sort of give back keys and leave? What's the ultimate upside? And how do you think about any near-term headwind to vacancy from this dynamic?Christopher Van ensChandni, it's Chris. I can help you out with that. So when the county eviction moratorium went away at the end of March, we had about 70 long-term delinquents in the portfolio. Once again, as Mike said, it's a pretty small market, it was 3.5% of NOI. But of those 70, about 40 came in and paid us right away as far as April rents. So they still have a balance that's due but they paid us April rent. Probably 2 to 3 people came in, paid April rent and paid off their entire balance. The remainder of them are either under eviction, sued -- served a payer quit notice, something like that. So we're working through that process right now.Joseph D. FisherYes. And just maybe some higher-level comments as it relates to the rest of the portfolio. Just a reminder, overall, we guided to mid-98% collected for 2023, which is pretty consistent with where we're at in 2022. I'd say we're seeing minimal variability at this point in time to that number. So don't see any downside, really don't see a lot of upside. Over time, we can probably get back to maybe a 99% collected for the portfolio. But going back to the mid-99s where we used to run is going to be exceedingly difficult just given eviction diversion programs in a lot of our portfolio.So somewhere in the mid-98s is where we're at. We did have a little bit higher write-offs than expected in the first quarter as we've had really good success getting some of those long-term delinquents out of the portfolio. We thought that would have taken a little bit longer throughout this year. And so while it was a little bit of a drag on both sequential and year-over-year revenue growth, we do think it's a tailwind as we go through the rest of this year on both sequential and year-over-year as we keep moving throughout the year on that front.So overall, feeling really good. I mean when you look at collections in the month as well as in April, March and April are running much higher than they were in 2022 in terms of in-the-month collections. And so between collections getting better, getting new residents in and also as we have some of these eviction moratoriums having come off and converting formerly nonpaying residents back to paying, we feel really good about where we're tracking in terms of guidance and the bad debt number.OperatorNext question, Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets.Juan Carlos SanabriaJust on the investment side, notwithstanding your capital-light strategy today and maybe the cost of capital not where you want it exactly, but curious what markets would look the best. With your kind of forward-thinking data analytic approach, sometimes it's a bit contrarian. Just curious, as you look out a couple of years, where you see the best opportunities across your opportunity set.Joseph D. FisherJuan, it's Joe. I mean I guess, number one, the area that we always have the most conviction is the transaction down the street. So if we can find another property nearby, no matter what market, there's so much efficiencies to gain out of that and additional scale to gain out of that. So we're never going to redline certain markets. We'll always be looking for deal next door. Beyond that, if we did have a source of capital that was compelling today, there's markets in every region that look good. If you go down into the Sunbelt, I'd say Dallas looks more compelling to us. Even Nashville, even though it has headwinds today, from a longer-term perspective, you're seeing permit activity come off really dramatically in Nashville at this point in time. So there's a couple of Sunbelt markets that we like.Out East, Philly's really been on a tear here recently in terms of market rent growth and continues to screen well for us as does D.C. and Boston from a longer-term perspective. And then out West, you look at maybe suburban San Diego. There's interest in Northern California, actually screens well from a quant perspective but you really got to pick and choose your points given the regulatory environment there and certain municipalities. And so that one is a little bit more challenging on the regulatory front. But I think overall, there's a lot of areas that we can pick and choose from. That's one of the benefits of being diversified. So if we do have a cost of capital or source of capital that's compelling, that's kind of where we'll look.Juan Carlos SanabriaAnd then just on renewals, you mentioned kind of the spread blew out between the new and the renewal spreads over the quarter. Just curious on how we should think about that for the balance of '23, maybe just how you're thinking about that in your own budget and where the May and June renewals have gone out at present.Michael D. LacyGreat question. What we're sending out today basically through June at this point is in that 5.5% to 6% range. We expect it to stabilize in that range probably over the next few months, maybe come down in that 5% to 6% going forward. And then new lease growth continues to move up on a month-over-month basis. So obviously, that spread will continue to compress.OperatorNext question, Michael Goldsmith with UBS.Michael GoldsmithMike, in your opening remarks, you described traffic is in line with last year but also commented the demand is relatively healthy. So does that imply that conversion is lower or something else is weighing on demand despite similar traffic?Michael D. LacyThat's a good catch. We have seen some of those conversion numbers come down a little bit just with some of the affordability that's down in the Sunbelt. So more cancels and denials. And it's really a product of people searching the market, getting an understanding of what's there for new supply, what concessions are being offered. So at times, we do have more people canceling. But we're still netting out where we need to be. And obviously, with our occupancy in that 96.5% to 96.7% range, we're still holding where we need to be. So feel pretty good about it.Michael GoldsmithGot it. And then, Tom, in your opening remarks, you talked about that the geographic diversity of your portfolio allow you to allocate capital in the markets that are most advantageous. You've kind of shifted to this balance sheet-light strategy where your active development pipeline includes Dallas and Tampa. So should we interpret that as these are the markets where you see the most opportunity?Thomas W. ToomeyYes, I'll kick it back to Joe. I think Joe highlighted it very earlier in the Q&amp;A with respect to we're always going to look for the deal next door where we can achieve the high level of efficiency and, in some cases, as Mike has done, actually operate assets with no one on site. So whether that's Tampa, Dallas. I think then we go to Chris and his analytics of where we think rents are trending with respect to the next 4 and 10 years, and that's our targeting aspect of it.The good news, as Joe also mentioned, was we're in 21 markets today, so that gives us a broad range of looking at where we can accretively deploy capital at any given time. And capital-light strategy is a reflection of where we currently trade with respect to our stock price and where we think assets would trade. So when that's not there, we turn to our other value creation mechanisms. And you've seen us highlight those over the years from either operations, innovation, to DCP, to redevelopment, which is probably gaining more steam in our mind these days as we see stabilization and growth prospects in these markets return or accelerate, in some cases.OperatorNext question, Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.Daniel Peter TricaricoThis is Dan Tricarico with Nick. First question, Mike, you may have said new lease rates in the Sunbelt have been a bit weaker than expected. So I'm curious if you could expect a relative softness there in relation to how you view the occupancy rent trade-offs entering like the peak season.Michael D. LacyYes, Dan. Again, we're still seeing healthy growth in the Sunbelt. It's just a little bit off from our original expectations. And we have seen market rents start to move up over the last 3 or 4 weeks there. So on a month-over-month basis, it continues to improve. It's just a little bit off from, again, what we said originally going into the year.Daniel Peter TricaricoSure. Okay. And then I guess, switching to the other Coast. So in your Northern California and Seattle portfolios, do you have a sense of what percentage of your tenants are employed by tech or big tech companies? And have you seen any increase in move-outs quoting job loss as the reason? Or do you think there's been sufficient rehiring to mitigate that given the job market strength that you quoted?Michael D. LacyYes. No, we watch that very closely, and we're still right around 13% to 15% exposure in both San Francisco and Seattle as a whole. We haven't seen a lot of people come in and drop off keys because of job-related events. And we continue to see in-migration in those areas. So again, it's not a lot of our exposure today and not seeing a lot of issues, if you will.Joseph D. FisherDan, it's Joe, maybe a couple of things to add to that, too. Just I know those 2 markets get a lot of focus given some of the headlines around the tech layoffs. But a number of individuals that are on this call have done some pretty extensive analysis on the warrant notices. We do our own analysis as well on that. And typically, you see maybe about 20% of those notices actually reside within California and Washington for those tech layoffs. So it is pretty well dispersed around the country. I think when you look at our blended lease rate activity in those 2 markets, both of those markets actually saw acceleration from 4Q into 1Q. So I think it gives you a sense that the layoffs are pretty diversified. Supply is actually coming down in Northern California. And from what we're seeing on the ground, we're actually seeing pretty good traction.OperatorNext question, Anthony Powell with Barclays.Anthony Franklin PowellI had a question around, I think, the April lease spreads again, which I think you mentioned a few times. So in the first quarter, you had blended spreads of 3.5%. And I believe in the prepared remarks, you talked about 2Q being closer to 3%. But in a Q&amp;A question, I believe you said 3.5% for April. So I wanted to make sure all those numbers were correct and maybe kind of tie them up.Michael D. LacySure. The 2Q, when we've referenced 3%, that is anchored towards our initial guidance. So it's still early in the quarter. Again, April looks a lot like 1Q. It all will hinge on what's going on with new lease growth. So again, if we're sending out 5.5% to 6% renewals through the remainder of 2Q, expect to see a little bit of improvement in new growth going into May, and then we'll have to see what June has to offer. But today, things are trending slightly better than that.Anthony Franklin PowellGot it. And maybe on the affordability, I think you've mentioned a few times that people aren't moving out to buy homes. It's more affordable to rent now and that fewer of your tenants are reporting affordability as an issue. That suggests that there's actually more pricing power than you're taking advantage of. So I'm curious if you agree with that. And maybe what's preventing you for pushing more on rent given kind of these favorable trends you talked about?Michael D. LacyI think that's where you see the spread between renewals and new leases. We are taking advantage of it today and we have been probably in the last 18 months or so. Typically, we're sending out renewals about $100 to $130 over market. And so that's why you have basically a 5% spread between new lease and renewals today. So we feel like we're aggressively pricing that but also trying to keep in mind retention is a key factor for us and obviously helps drive new lease growth as well.OperatorNext question, Alan Peterson with Green Street.Alan Robert PetersonMike, in terms of your proactiveness in using concessions in San Francisco, can you share what other markets you're needing to be proactive in using concessions? And are you expecting to use concessions over the balance of the year to maintain this mid-96% occupancy level?Michael D. LacyYes, Alan, what I would tell you, it's been kind of more of the same. Similar, again, in April, we're seeing similar trends. We're still offering concessions in those pockets. It's in San Francisco, parts of D.C., and it's extremely minimal in cases down in the Sunbelt. Right now, what I would tell you, April again looks very similar. I don't expect that we're going to go up more than, call it, a week per new lease and going forward into the season. Demand is still strong. We still have plenty of visits coming to the property. We're going to continue to balance that. I don't expect concessions to be much of a drag on us.Alan Robert PetersonAppreciate that. And then maybe just shifting over to the DCP portfolio. For the deals that are maturing within the next 12 to 18 months, are you guys seeing any weakness on lease-up? Or are your development partners concerned about refinancing the more senior portion of those debt and construction loans?Joseph D. FisherAlan, just I'll give some context on that. I mean I think you're right to focus on the near term. We get questions on this, leading up of the call as well as last night, kind of trying to understand if there's any stress in the system. I'd say, number one, as mentioned earlier, it's only 2% of enterprise value. And when you look on Attachment 11b, clearly fairly well diversified, not just by market but also maturity schedule.And so we've got a couple of questions on capital stack, so I'll kind of address that here as a part of your question. If you look at the overall capital stack for our DCP book, and I'm going to kick out the portfolio recap deal as well as the Portland deals, which we're also operating recaps, so a little bit different risk profile, so just looking at more of the development deals. We've got about a $1.6 billion cost for that development portfolio. There's about $950 million of senior loan, so call it, 60% loan to cost. Our commitment was about $350 million on those deals, so 60% to 80%, and then you had about $300 million of equity behind us. So a pretty good amount of equity sitting behind us on all those transactions. When you focus on these upcoming maturities, you got one in Philly, Santa Monica and Oakland. Those are about $360 million of total cost. When you look at the capital stack within those, you've got a senior loan that's about $215 million. You've got commitment from UDR for the portion of about $90 million, and we had about $55 million of equity originally behind us on those.Now we've continued to accrue up our interest income. So our basis today on an accrual basis is a little bit higher than that initial but still pretty sufficient equity behind us. So at this point in time, yes, we haven't taken any impairments on those. We are, of course, starting to have the discussions with our equity partners as well as lenders, trying to think through what their plan is in terms of do they want to restructure, do they want to exit through a sale, do they simply want to extend with the senior and see what happens on a go-forward basis. So no stress to speak of right now but not to say it won't develop over time, depend on where refi rates are and fundamentals.OperatorNext question, Flora Tong with Evercore ISI.Flora TongI guess the acquisition volume remains unchanged at 0. And I wonder if you're seeing more distressed opportunities coming into the market. And separately, are you seeing a big slowdown in new starts or planned starts from maybe some of the and the merchant builders?Joseph D. FisherSo yes, I guess to kind of bifurcate distressed comment into 2 different buckets, so there's -- is there a distressed pricing and/or are there distressed equity partners. On the former, I would say no. If you're a seller and you're willing to meet the market at that plus or minus 5% cap rate range, we don't think of that as distressed. You're not going to be able to buy a 6% cap in a 5% cap environment. So if you're a seller that's willing to meet the market, in multifamily where you have pretty substantial capital flows, it's a preferred asset class. And of course, we have the benefits of the GSEs, which are still lending kind of in that high 4% range. We don't think you see distressed pricing. Now you could, of course, see equity deals on merchants that maybe got upside down, got too far out over their skis in terms of underwriting or how they financed, but that doesn't necessarily lead to distressed pricing. So I don't think that's going to necessarily occur.In terms of the forward pipeline and what's taking place in supply, yes, you're starting to see it in some of the numbers with some of the starts and permit activity for multifamily coming off, call it, 5% to 10% from peak levels in 2022. I think when you look at broader, kind of total housing supply, clearly, the single-family space haven't come off 30-plus percent, and therefore, total housing supply coming off about 20%. You are starting to see the impact of that. It's probably not going to flow through until you get into second half of '24 and then 2025. So it's ways out there.I mentioned earlier within our DCP pipeline just what we're seeing in terms of new deals, it's off dramatically, which tells you, because of what's going on in the regional bank space, what's going on with ability to raise equity, you're going to start seeing way fewer starts on a go-forward basis. So we do think that's going to be a future tailwind.Thomas W. ToomeyFlora, this is Toomey. Just one thing to add to your calculus when you're thinking about this, the multifamily industry enjoys the benefit and partnership with the GSEs, provide a stable capital flow that helps the transaction market continue to flow, the refi market continue to flow. And so there's not this historical just everything's got to be sold and there's no capital, so it's vulture time, if you will, that occurs in the multifamily industry as long as we have the GSE. So it's a unique animal for us and very beneficial through periods like this, as I mentioned earlier, capital markets recession.Flora TongThat's really helpful. And maybe shifting to the technology, I know UDR has been fairly active on the innovation front. Have you seen any opportunity associated with artificial intelligence, such as ChatGPT or other language model, that can help UDR create further technology efficiencies going forward?Joseph D. FisherWe have seen that. We've actually rolled out AI chat, text and call across the portfolio over the last 12 months. And so that's already being utilized throughout our portfolio. There are going to be additional opportunities that we think going forward. We've already started to kind of sketching those out in terms of how do you provide the customer kind of individualized responses, how to give them more automated responses but feel like they are addressing their specific questions, they understand their specific history, what their issues could be. So there's definitely going to be an opportunity for that in terms of the customer experience and providing them a better customer experience but also, from a cost perspective, how to bring our cost structure down. So we are looking at it, I think it's pretty early days other than what we've done on the AI chat side.Thomas W. ToomeyAnd Flora, just one data point, Toomey again. With respect to the AI chat piece, surprisingly enough, it closes better than we thought it would. It's about a 10% higher closing rate on our sales than we've seen through a natural call center-type template. So customers are embracing it, so it must be working.OperatorNext question, Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.Alexander David GoldfarbSo just really quick 2 quickies. First, Joe, on the insurance front, is there opportunity for you guys to increase the amount that you self-insure to try and mitigate some of the large premium increases or some of the carriers or reinsurers pulling back?Joseph D. FisherYes, Alex, good question. That's actually an analysis we go through every single year, looking at every single layer, how the layers are being filled in and how pricing is relative to loss history. And so each year, we go through that analysis. So when it comes up for renewal again in December, we'll go through that same analysis. I think with capacity having pulled back in the space and despite premiums going higher, it really hasn't returned. Some of the profit margins that these insurers are taking are pretty substantial relative to loss history. So it's one of the advantages of, obviously, being a pretty large diversified company that's well capitalized relative to being a private operator that may not have that capability and has to just take on that premium increase. So it's something we'll be looking at.Alexander David GoldfarbOkay. And then the second question just quickly, you guys mentioned the Sunbelt being weaker but you also mentioned that your B portfolio isn't really being impacted by the supply. So just sort of curious if that was sort of a relative because East Coast is performing better than you thought, maybe you expected better out of Sunbelt or if you're just saying more Sunbelt broadly but not really about your assets in particular?Michael D. LacyAlex, I think it does go back to East Coast just doing better, in general. And where we are seeing pockets of weakness, it's more in those urban settings in the Sunbelt because that's where the supply is coming from. So that's why the Bs are outperforming a little bit more down there than we would have expected going into the year.OperatorNext question, Tayo Okusanya with Credit Suisse.Omotayo Tejamude OkusanyaActually, my questions have been answered. I just couldn't figure out how to get off the queue.OperatorI would now like to turn the floor over to Tom Toomey for closing remarks.Thomas W. ToomeyThis is Tom again, and thank you all for your time, interest and support of UDR. We've established ourselves as a full cycle investment that delivers above-average growth and total shareholder return across a variety of macro environments. We remain very enthusiastic about the apartment business and believe our operating capital allocation and innovation advantages should deliver relative outperformance versus peers in 2023 and beyond. .And with that, we look forward to seeing many of you at NAREIT conference in June as well as upcoming individual events. With that, take care.OperatorThis concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.]"

Horton's (NYSE:DHI) Upcoming Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-d-r-hortons-nyse-101435942.html,1682676875,STORY,['DHI'],"[Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next three days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Accordingly, D.R. Horton investors that purchase the stock on or after the 2nd of May will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 10th of May.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.25 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$1.00 per share to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, D.R. Horton has a trailing yield of approximately 0.9% on its current stock price of $108.34. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. As a result, readers should always check whether D.R. Horton has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. View our latest analysis for D.R. Horton If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. D.R. Horton paid out just 6.3% of its profit last year, which we think is conservatively low and leaves plenty of margin for unexpected circumstances. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Luckily it paid out just 12% of its free cash flow last year.It's positive to see that D.R. Horton's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. That's why it's comforting to see D.R. Horton's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 41% per annum for the past five years. With earnings per share growing rapidly and the company sensibly reinvesting almost all of its profits within the business, D.R. Horton looks like a promising growth company.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, D.R. Horton has lifted its dividend by approximately 21% a year on average. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it.To Sum It UpHas D.R. Horton got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? D.R. Horton has been growing earnings at a rapid rate, and has a conservatively low payout ratio, implying that it is reinvesting heavily in its business; a sterling combination. Overall we think this is an attractive combination and worthy of further research.On that note, you'll want to research what risks D.R. Horton is facing. For example, we've found 2 warning signs for D.R. Horton (1 makes us a bit uncomfortable!) that deserve your attention before investing in the shares.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Very Cheap Stocks to Buy Right Now.Stock valuations are again a topic of discussion currently as some analysts are warning against the market’s optimism that is sending tech valuations soaring to record levels. While several analysts believe the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates just one more time in 2023 before hitting a temporary pause, there’s a section in the market that is hoping for rate cuts. This optimism is having a direct effect on the technology sector which looks great in the short term. The S&amp;P 500 Information Technology Index is up 23% in 2023, compared to a 7.7% gain of the broader S&amp;P 500 index in the same period. According to an analysis by Bloomberg, this was the IT sector’s strongest start to a year since 2009. However, this optimism is unfounded and could cause pain for investors in the coming weeks or months. The Bloomberg report said that tech stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are trading at about 25 times their prospective earnings.“To justify such a multiple, the Fed would need to cut rates by at least 300 basis points,” the report said, citing data from Bloomberg Intelligence.The report cited Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial, who said the following:“Traders are betting on a big about-face in the Fed’s interest-rate policy, but there is no certainty as to whether, and when, this will happen. Longer-term, the sector’s growth prospects are attractive, but not at the current valuations.”Data from Research Affiliates shows that valuations of US stocks are reaching extremely high levels.Research Affiliates looked at the CAPE ratio metric and found that the US stock benchmark trades at a multiple around 29, pricier than it has been more than 90% of the time since 1881.But not all sectors emit this euphoria. The banking sector, which was devastated by the collapse of multiple banks earlier this year, is still reeling from steep share price declines. Some analysts believe some bank stocks are offering attractive entry points since the fundamentals of several banks that are currently down remain strong.Story continuesBaird analyst David George recently said in a note that the sentiment around bank stocks has been “abysmal” over the past few weeks and “market participants seem to be pricing in permanent profitability destruction, which we think is unlikely.” The analyst said that the banking sector’s risk/reward is “very attractive following panic selling.” George believes these stocks have priced in a “catastrophe.”Best Very Cheap Stocks to Buy Right NowTechnology share chartOur MethodologyFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and picked 15 tech stocks with PE ratios less than 15 as of April 25.

Investors are concerned about legal liabilities associated with its antacid drug Zantac.

As an integrated energy company, approximately one third of Shell’s revenues come from transition fuels, such as LNG, and another third comes from new energy sources such as green hydrogen. LNG is one of the cleanest fossil fuels and represents a potential bridge to the future by replacing higher carbon energy sources with lower carbon ones while renewable technologies mature.

We reinvested the proceeds in Philip Morris so that relative position sizing is more consistent with our increased conviction.”11.

American is off to a fantastic start in 2023. This year, we remain focused on reliability, profitability, strengthening our balance sheet and holding ourselves accountable along the way. This morning, American reported a first quarter profit for the first time in 4 years, an improvement of almost $2 billion versus the first quarter of 2022. Our performance in the first quarter was driven by continued strength in demand and the tremendous work of our team. American entered the year in a position of strength after the outstanding results our team delivered in 2022, and we've built on that momentum in the first quarter. The American Airlines team ran a reliable operation for our customers and delivered a profit for the quarter, beating our initial EPS guidance of approximately breakeven. Let's talk more about our first quarter results. We produced record first quarter revenues of nearly $12.2 billion, an increase of 37% versus 2022, a 9.2% more capacity year-over-year. Demand for our product remains strong. We continue to be very pleased with our domestic and short-haul international unit revenue performance. We've also seen noticeable strength in long-haul international demand, where we have allocated approximately 80% of our second quarter capacity growth year-over-year and continue to see strong yield performance curing into the summer months. Demand for our premium cabin has been remarkable across all entities with premium paid load factor and RASM exceeding 2019 levels. We're well on our way to a fully recovered business, but we aren't there yet. The recovery is still unfolding and the current demand environment remains dynamic. We continue to learn about evolving customer preferences and changing demand patterns. And we've spent the past 3 years building a resilient airline that can adjust to the variability in demand.We remain nimble and continue to adapt to customer behaviors, both in terms of when and where customers book travel and how we service them. Importantly, customers continue to show a preference for our direct channels and travel rewards program. Our co-brand growth continues to outperform consumer spending in line with AAdvantage enrollment, which are now approximately 60% higher than 2019 on capacity that is not yet fully restored to 2019 levels.The American Airlines co-brand portfolio is delivering the fastest growth since the inception of our current agreement with double-digit growth in sales versus the first quarter of 2022. Now let's turn to the operations. The American Airlines team delivered a stellar performance in the first quarter. We operated more than 476,000 flights in the quarter with an average load factor of 80%. We delivered our best ever first quarter completion factor and controllable completion factor, safely completing more flights and more on-time flights than anyone in the industry.We're performing better than ever from an operational perspective. We delivered this strong performance in the first quarter despite the nationwide ground stop in mid-January due to the (inaudible) and several disruptive weather events that impacted our hubs across the country. Our largest hub DFW was greatly impacted by winter storms in January and February and tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in March.Our strong operational performance is driven by our team's focus on running a safe and reliable airline and taking care of what we can control. Investments in our operation have enabled us to anticipate the operating conditions ahead of us and recover quickly when the unexpected happens. And we'll continue to invest in our team, fleet and technology so that we're well prepared heading into the summer and the rest of the year.I also want to thank and acknowledge the DOT and the FAA for their efforts to reduce congestion in New York, which will certainly help the industry deliver more reliably for customers this summer. And now over to Devon to share more about our first quarter results and the outlook for the second quarter.Devon E. MayThank you, Robert. I'm tremendously proud of what the American Airlines team accomplished during the first quarter. As Robert mentioned, we run a great operation and delivered on our financial guidance for the quarter, keeping us on track with the full year plan we outlined in January. During the first quarter, excluding net special items, we reported net income of $33 million or adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.05. This result is better than the initial guidance we provided in January, driven by strong revenue production and slightly lower fuel expense during the quarter. As Robert mentioned, we produced record first quarter revenue of $12.2 billion, up 37% year-over-year.Unit revenue was 25.4% higher in the quarter on 9.2% more capacity. Unit costs for the quarter, excluding net special items and fuel, were 1.4% lower year-over-year in line with the midpoint of our initial guidance range. We generated adjusted operating income in the quarter of $451 million, resulting in a first quarter adjusted operating margin of 3.7%. We have made significant investments in our fleet over the past decade, and these investments are paying off. The refleeting of the airline and the reconfiguration of our narrowbody interiors have greatly improved the customer experience, simplified our mainline fleet from 8 aircraft types to 4, and aligned our narrowbody density with our network competitors. American continues to operate the simplest and youngest fleet among U.S. network carriers.We continue to expect to reactivate 9 737s from long-term storage and take delivery of 23 new aircraft in 2023. We took three deliveries in the first quarter and expect 9 in the second quarter; 5 in the third quarter; and 6 in the fourth quarter. 13 of the deliveries are already financed, and we expect to finalize financing agreements for the remaining 10 this quarter. Based on the latest delivery guidance from Boeing and Airbus, our 2023 aircraft CapEx is expected to be approximately $1.5 billion, and non-aircraft CapEx is expected to be approximately $800 million. In the first quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $3.3 billion. Our adjusted net investing cash flows were $317 million, resulting in record quarterly free cash flow generation of $3 billion. We ended the quarter with $14.4 billion of total available liquidity, $2.4 billion more than our year-end 2022 liquidity balance, driven by bookings strength and ATL growth in the quarter.We continue to make progress on strengthening our balance sheet, reducing total debt by more than $850 million in the quarter. This debt reduction, combined with the improvement in liquidity, resulted in a $3.4 billion decrease in net debt during the first quarter. We now have reduced total debt by more than $9 billion from peak debt levels in mid-2021. Importantly, we ended the first quarter with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.5x, which is lower than our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio at the end of 2019.By the end of 2023, we continue to expect our total debt to be $10 billion to $11 billion lower than peak debt levels in mid-2021, and we remain committed to our goal of reducing total debt by $15 billion by the end of 2025. Additionally, a constructive financing environment in February allowed us to proactively refinance a 2025 maturity. Our $1.75 billion term loan, primarily collateralized by our South America portfolio of [slots], gates and routes. The refinancing transaction efficiently derisked our 2025 debt maturity tower by nearly 20%.We will continue to balance debt reduction opportunities and investments in the business while meeting appropriate liquidity levels. We continue to see a constructive demand environment in the second quarter and summer and bookings remain strong. Revenue intakes in the past months are well ahead of the same booking period in 2019, including robust international bookings as customers return to long-haul international travel this summer.Compared to the historically strong unit revenue we produced in 2022, we expect second quarter TRASM to be down 2% to 4% year-over-year on 3.5% to 5.5% more capacity. We expect second quarter CASMx to be up 3.5% to 5.5% year-over-year. This projection includes the impact of an anticipated pilot agreement. We continue to expect the full year impact of all anticipated labor agreements to be approximately 3 points of CASMx. Our current forecast for the second quarter assumes a fuel price of between $2.65 and $2.75 per gallon, which is $1.30 per gallon lower year-over-year. We expect to produce an operating margin of between 11% and 13% in the second quarter based on our current demand and fuel price forecast. Excluding special items, we expect to produce earnings of between $1.20 and $1.40 per diluted share in the second quarter. These strong results keep us on track to execute on our full year earnings guidance of between $2.50 and $3.50 per diluted share. Now I'd like to hand it back to Robert for further remarks.Robert D. IsomThanks, Devon. And to close, I'd like to take just a few minutes to highlight why I'm so excited about the future of the industry and the future of American Airlines in particular. Our industry has been through the biggest crisis in its history and is now on the other side. Airlines have navigated a lot over the last few years, concerns about the economy and demand recovery, the banking crisis, the interest rate environment, supply chain issues and yet, here we are.The industry is in an excellent position and benefiting not only from the recovery and evolving travel patterns, but also from consumers changing preference of experiences over hard goods. And I'd like to underscore, we have strong demand environment this summer, and we're highly confident that, that will continue going forward. If there's one thing that the pandemic has taught us is that people innately desire to travel. And in America, the actions that we've taken in the recent years are producing returns.We simplified and harmonized our fleet to provide more flexibility to our network, which is nimbler and more focused on our most profitable flying. And our Sun Belt hubs are uniquely positioned to take advantage of demographic changes going on in the U.S. right now. We've built partnerships that are a great complement to our network and enable us to provide even more unique O&amp;Ds to our customers.Our fleet, which is younger than our network peers drives low CapEx requirements in the near term, enabling us to generate free cash flow that can be used to reinvest in the business and strengthen our balance sheet. We've also made investments to modernize our facilities and introduce new technology throughout the airline. These initiatives are producing the results that we had hoped for.And we have a number of opportunities in front of us to deliver even more value. We're making terrific progress training pilots, getting our regional fleet back up on the air and getting more out of our mainline fleet as well. That means that there is real and significant upside in terms of the utilization of our existing assets. We're also very encouraged by our operational focus and our ability to grow the airline efficiently, all while completing more flights on schedule, generating more revenue and reducing costs.On the commercial side, we're building on our premier loyalty program and the changes we have made are having a real impact on how customers are spending and engaging with us. There's even more we'll do in the coming years to grow AAdvantage and our co-brand offerings. We're meeting our customers where they want to do business and bringing more people into our direct channels. We'll continue to adapt our offerings based on evolving customer preferences.Finally, we are driving a technology-first mindset at America, not only with existing processes, but also with the introduction of new tools for our customers and teams. And we look forward to sharing more on all of this as the year progresses. Looking ahead, we feel great about the industry and what's to come from America. The actions that we have taken have pushed in a position of strength that have allowed us to capitalize on the recovery.We'll continue to hold ourselves accountable to produce stronger margins, generate free cash flow, strengthen our balance sheet and run a reliable operation, ultimately creating more value for our customers and shareholders. And with that, operator, please open the line for analyst questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein.David Scott VernonI wonder if you could talk a little bit about intra-quarter trends and how second quarter sort of is shaping up from a booking perspective. I think investors are -- have been very sensitive to potential sort of disruptions or changes in maybe business travel trends kind of as we've gone through the banking crisis here. I'm wondering if you could just kind of give us a sense for what you're seeing day-to-day in the booking curve and how that is impacting your confidence in the outlook for summer travel?Robert D. IsomThanks, David. I'm going to send that straight to Vasu.Vasu RajaLook, we remain encouraged by the demand environment that's out there. We see strong bookings strength really across the airline network International, of course, long-haul international is seeing a lot more bookings come in a lot sooner, really reflecting the pent-up demand that's been there in many markets they really haven't been open for the better part of 4 years. Domestic, we continue to see historically strong booking and indeed, a resumption of a lot of -- a lot more people looking further in advance than what they had last year, certainly, more people willing to go and shift from a peak time flight to a trough time play, which reflects changes in work schedules through the week. But by and large, we remain encouraged by what we see out there. And I'll add to that, too, that consistent with a lot of the trends that we've seen in past quarters, we are -- we continue to see a shift from a traditional business style trip, the more blended trips and more discretionary trips. In Q1, about 35% of our volume was leisure discretionary based trips; 35% blended trips; and 30% business trips. That compares to first quarter '19 where it was more like 30% leisure, 30% blended 40% business, but we remain encouraged by it. Though we're seeing that shift, we find that very often, the blended yields that we see are coming in at values that are 8% to 10% higher than the very traditional business trips that they replaced. So we remain encouraged and see a lot of the same trends we've been talking about for the last few quarters.David Scott VernonAnd Devon, could I ask you to talk a little bit about the maturities coming up in the next couple of years on the debt [taxes]? You mentioned you're going to be paying down around $2 billion of debt this year. How should we be looking from a liquidity perspective at the end of 2023 based on the guidance? And then what does that -- and how does that compare to the maturities in a kind of a 2- to 3-year time frame?Robert D. IsomSo to start this year, we have talked about our total debt paydown being at approximately $10 billion to $11 billion from our peak levels of summer of 2021. For this year, we expect total debt to be down about $3 billion versus 2022. In terms of where our cash will be at the end of the year, obviously, we've talked a lot about a $10 billion to $12 billion target for liquidity. We're well ahead of that at the end of the first quarter. When we think 10 to 12, I generally think of it as -- and we'd like to be around $10 billion of liquidity as we are late in the year at the full point for liquidity that arises to $12 billion during the year. At this point, we're well ahead of our target liquidity. I expect we would definitely be on the high end of target liquidity if we hit the midpoint of our guidance this year. And then just longer term, 2024, we have a little bit of a step-up in maturities. I think most people understand in 2025, we have a higher debt tower. We proactively addressed some of that with refinancing in the first quarter. The remainder of it, we will seek to either pay down or refinance a portion of it depending on our cash flow production over the next couple of years.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Helane Baker -- I'm sorry, Helane Becker of Cowen.Helane Renee BeckerJust two questions. One, I'm wondering on operations, Robert, you mentioned in the quarter that you were, I think, at the top of on-time performance and so on. I'm wondering if you could talk about some of the learnings that you've had in being -- with like the Dallas storms and the no TAM shutdown and then what happened in Fort Lauderdale earlier this month. Just how that will carry through to prepare yourselves for the summer, which is likely to be pretty difficult? And then my second question is, I'm wondering if Vasu, you can talk about the changes you made to NDC and Travel Agent bookings and how that's being received?Robert D. IsomAnd good to hear from you. Hey, we've learned a lot over the last year. Let's face it, summer 2022 is pretty rocky. And during that time, we got right to work to make sure that we plan the airlines that -- for the resources that we have. And that's played out over the course of this past year. We got stronger and stronger as the 2022 closed. And as we progressed throughout 2023, what I'm most encouraged about is really when conditions permit, we fly an exceptional airline. We complete nearly every flight. And that bodes well for the summer. I know that there are going to be issues, and we're going to have to stay on top of things. But we've never been more prepared from the perspective of having the right resources in the right place. And that's everything from gate to the station level to pilot and flight attendants to mechanics. So we feel really good about where we're heading. But your question about, hey, issues happen. So we're planned well. But in terms of those issues and disruptions, they're going to happen. We had [to bear] thunder storms here in DFW last night, but we have new tools in place to allow us to build back from any disruption in a lot better fashion and one that, quite frankly, protects more passengers. So our misconnection rates are very, very manageable right now. And as we take a look going forward, the tools that we've put in place, a system called Heat, that is appropriately named as heat builds up, the thunderstorms happen and disruptions happen. What we do is we actually put in place delay programs and cancellation programs to protect the system and protect the most number of customers that ultimately allow us to recover quicker. Now this is part of a bigger, longer-range plan, and I'm probably going to give more of an answer here than you need. But after the last 5 years of integration and the pandemic, we're at a point where we can really do a lot more with the assets that we have. We have a new CIO here, Ganesh Jayaram. And I want him to just talk quickly about a technology-first mindset that we've introduced that is really going to get at the heart of those questions that you're bringing up about operational reliability. Ganesh?Ganesh JayaramYes. Thanks, Robert. So the past 7 months that I've been in this role, our technology team has refined our playbook to work better and faster with our partners in the priority areas of operations and commercial to deliver technology solutions that need and exceed the expectations of our customers and team members. So going forward, we're really excited that we bring new digital solutions to the market in a much more agile manner than in the past to improve our customers' ability to self-serve all the needs with American as well as solutions like heat that improve the resilience of our daily flight operations. Lastly, as a technology team. We are working very closely with Devon and the finance team business appropriately and modernizing our technology stack to help us deliver the additional capabilities for the future. I can now turn it over to Vasu and David to share some examples of solutions that we're excited to bring to the market in the rest of the year.Vasu RajaI can pick up a little bit on the technology point, but let me speak very directly to your question about distribution. It's really important to understand our changes through the lens of how our customers have changed because that is our true north. Understanding them and building our enterprise around that is how, of course, we create value. And so earlier, I mentioned how the transaction mix has changed and has been changing. But what's really important is beyond that transaction mix, how our customers consume our product has changed materially. So if you go back to 2019 and look at all the unique customers took a business trip, the top 60% of business traveling customers produced well over 80% of all the business travel revenue at American Airlines. When you look at that in 2023, that same population of unique customers is actually spending 15% more on flight revenue with the airline. However, the mix of their trips has changed materially. It used to be that over 50% of their trips were purely for business purposes. Now less -- well less than 40% of their trips are purely business purposes. That, let's call it, 10 to 15 points of shift has gone pretty much entirely to blended style trips, but it's gone entirely out of the travel agency distribution channel into our direct channels like dot com and app. And so that's been a thing we've been observing really for the better part of the last year the trends continue to accelerate. So -- and you've seen that all across our commercial changes. We've actively repositioned the network where we fly less in short-haul markets like, say, New York to Chicago, but we started a new market like New York to Tulsa. We've done things with our loyalty program, our advantaged Travel Rewards program to make it easier to go and earn miles for things which aren't just taking a historical business trip, which were fewer of those travelers are doing it. But the next and very important part is how we sell and service our product. And what we've realized is so many of those customers are going direct, frankly, because they're used to a consumer experience than any other retailer where it's -- they can buy the product and shop digitally, and they can service it themselves. So when you look at us through that lens, our changes are really kind of simple. By the end of Q2, we'll -- anything that we sell in a U.S. point of origination, a customer will be able to go and service, buy and service digitally through our dot-com and our app, which is a huge change from where the airline has been, a market difference from where many of our competitors are. However, traditional travel agency technology doesn't enable us to roll those same services out through it. But some of the new travel agency technology that's there, the people like Sabre and Amadeus and Travel Porter offering, enable us to do exactly that. So as the summer rolls on, you'll see us rolling more of our selling and servicing tools into this new distribution capability. And that's something which ultimately should be beneficial to travel agencies. That will enable really forward-thinking agencies to serve our joint customers a whole lot better. And so far, we've been actually extremely encouraged. We've had 3 or 4 weeks now where we've been migrating more services and more of our fair products into this new distribution technology and the results have been extremely encouraging. So if you look at first quarter, about 10% of our revenue was booked by travel agencies. We're now -- virtually all of their future bookings are coming through new distribution technologies. We've also seen new travel agency competitors emerge and they're growing at an exponential week-to-week rate. And they're really disrupting the traditional travel management company model. At their current rate of bookings, they will be as any of the three largest travel management companies in terms of booked a revenue probably by this summer. And what we're really encouraged by is every day a new corporate customer is coming to us asking about how they can connect directly to us or which -- how they go and best source all the fair content of American Airlines. So the important thing is really, for us, we are making our changes really in service of where our customers are going. We think it's something which can be great for the travel agency community, but above all, the end consumer is going to benefit from more competition, better services, lower cost of sale. So we're encouraged with where this is going.Robert D. IsomI appreciate you letting us go along on that because you can tell your question gets to the heart of everything that we're doing from a strategic perspective operationally and commercially.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore.Duane Thomas PfennigwerthI have a network question, maybe a little bit of a philosophical one for Vasu or Robert, as we think back to historical periods for the airline industry, there were definitely periods where international growth was funded by domestic capacity cuts when international growth prospects were more attractive. And if we think about the experience through the pandemic where everyone was domestically focused and Florida focused because that was the only thing open. Now slowly market by market, the rest of the world has gradually become Florida too, you all now have a much larger opportunity set. So why don't you think we're seeing some of the domestic bets, which were totally appropriate in the pandemic context being rolled back? And what do you think the set of circumstances that would drive a better portfolio outcome by funding international growth with domestic cuts and appreciate the long-winded philosophical question.Robert D. IsomI'll start with, I think, some realities in the business. And then Vasu can do more from the philosophical standpoint. But first, I just think it's important for people to know that American is growing less than anybody else this year. And it's not necessarily by choice. I mean, let's face it. We've run into issues with the constraints that we are all aware of. Manufacturers haven't been able to deliver aircraft on time, and we've had pilot constraints that have gotten in the way. And that has, to some degree, shaped what we've been able to do. So we have, I think, almost 150 regional aircraft that are still on the ground, and we're not serving a lot of small cities that really have lost service and we'd like to get back into. And so I think that, that's an opportunity for us. And then in regard to international, Vasu will talk more about it, but that is absolutely the largest portion of our growth in this coming year, but it's largely been constrained by our other issues. Vasu?Vasu RajaYes, that's right. I'll pick up from there. And I appreciate your long-winded philosophical question. My boss tells me that I'm (inaudible) to be long-winded and philosophical, but I will be very focused and philosophical for this one. Because this is a topic that we've thought about for really a long time since the start of the pandemic. First, to pick up where Robert left off, when you look out, though our capacity mix is about 75% to 80% short haul versus long haul, 80% of our growth as we head into the next quarter is really all the -- what we call the build back of the long-haul network on a more efficient fleet base. So we -- that's the start of more -- as indeed more airplanes come from Boeing. But also what's very important to note is we very consciously went and built our fleet and our network through the pandemic so that it can go and be nimble and produce a level of earnings growth across the business cycle. So importantly, when you look at us, right, versus 2019, we are about 45 widebodies smaller, 45 narrowbodies larger. That's material because in the long-haul business, and we've seen this over time, it's the most volatile part of a relatively volatile business. It's most capital-intensive part of a capital-intensive business, and it can be very complex operationally too. So what we found is that actually by being a very focused operator, a simplified fleet, things like that, that enables us to go and respond to demand a lot more appropriately. So further to that, to what Robert said, the way we go about doing that is actually by making as many unique origin and destination markets as we can. And our primary asset for doing that is the large narrowbody, whether it fills widebody jets or fill regional jets. And the more of that connectivity we can make, the better it is. So what you'll see in our international network, you see it already, is really an orientation around places where we can leverage our domestic strength. For example, Dallas Fort Worth or Charlotte, which will have four trips to London this summer or markets where we can leverage our partnership network. We will fly JFK to Doha where we're able to connect to the entirety of the Qatar Airways network, for example. And we grade that performance really on, are we generating as a system? Are we generating more industry revenue, more of our share of industry revenue versus capacity share? When you look back at the last 4 or 5 quarters, that's certainly been the case. At large, we're able to collect more revenue than the capacity share that we're flying. So we're encouraged by that. This summer in long haul is going to be a seasonally -- and probably historically strong long-haul summer. Overtime, that is going to go and normalize, and we will be able to grow into that and we'll have a fleet that will enables us to go serve it and [add on] where the demand is.Robert D. IsomDuane, just one other piece of kind of real news on top of that. It's just that to add to that O&amp;D base, I mentioned the 150 aircraft that we're not flying from a regional perspective, I think that we've seen the low point of supportability. And as we take a look through the rest of the year, that's going to be built back. And I don't know if we'll be back to probably 100 aircraft down, but I look out over certainly in the next 18, 24 months, to be in a much better position just for utilization and also being able to service these smaller cities and contributing to what Vasu just said from a philosophical perspective.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Andrew Didora of Bank of America.Andrew George DidoraMaybe sticking with the philosophical a little bit. I'm sure this is still a real tough time to give some revenue projections. I guess when you sit down with your -- when we sat down with your team over the last couple of weeks, which entities today are easier to forecast than maybe some others aren't?Robert D. IsomThat's an excellent question. And look, this business is nothing if not dynamic. Look, in our system probably -- there's probably a lot more forecast clarity in our short-haul network than our long-haul network. Do not exactly to any particular demand trends, but just simply to the fact that we've been operating a big domestic system for a really long time. So if you go back and look at last year, the demand environment in domestic, it was strong as we headed into the second quarter. It was made stronger by the fact that so many long-haul markets were -- they were either closed or it was really difficult for customers to go through. But by being big last year and by continuing to being much bigger than what many other airlines were, it gave us a better sense for any amount of demand projections, but things such as how far from departure the booking curve is, how we can position our network based on demand changes, changing customer profiles and tastes. So right now, there's probably a little more accuracy around the short-haul network than the long-haul network.Andrew George DidoraGreat. That's helpful. And then just a second question here, I guess more near term, just any update this morning. I know you reiterated your full year capacity and earnings goals, but nothing around revenues or costs. Have your thoughts here changed at all? Or are you just kind of holding in the historical revenue fuel relationship?Unidentified Company RepresentativeYes. I'd just say we're pretty early in the year for an update on either revenue or fuel. So we're leaving those out. I will say on the our CASMx fuel basis, we still feel really good about our initial guidance of CASM, up 2% to 5% for that period. And I think we'll be right around the midpoint of that at least as we sit here today.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley.Ravi ShankerIt feels like the next kind of 12 to 18 months are going to be pretty important for managed corporate as a lot of the kind of old grandfathered enterprise corporate contracts come up for renewal. And you obviously have a few more competitors potentially to enter the game and maybe the size of the pie is also a little bit smaller, at least in the short term. How are you guys thinking about where American is positioned relative to kind of some of the enterprise historical competitors as well as maybe some of the new entrants and kind of going off of that managed corporate share?Vasu RajaRavi, this is Vasu. And I'll pick up your question with reference to some of my early comments here, and our customers have changed. And probably where that change is the greatest is with contract and corporations. So in 1Q '19, our mix of business revenue, I said we were 40%. That was kind of a 2:1 split between non-contracted customers and contracted customers. Now what we're seeing and what we've been seeing is that relationship is more like a 3:1 split between non-contracted customers and contracted customers. So there's -- the nature of the travel that's out there has changed a lot. But also the way in which we think about corporates has changed as customer tastes have changed. And if you think about it for so many corporates, really when companies aren't back to work, it's really hard to go and get people back on the road, and we see that. So where we are today, 95% of our corporate accounts are telling us that they're not enforcing a travel policy, in which they require an employee to fly one airline versus another. And across our contracted base, over 60% of our corporate contracts don't fulfill the volume and share goals that we've set out, which is completely understandable. The marketplace has changed. If companies are struggling to bring people back to the office, it's practical to think that it's difficult to get them back on the road. But that said, among that -- to refer to my earlier comments, that same base of customers though they may be traveling less on a contracted deal, they're actually spending more money traveling on the airline. And indeed, that base of customers are doing things -- they're the ones who are most likely to acquire our credit card or where they have our credit card. They're the ones most likely to go and drive up spending on it. So we're actually really encouraged as contracts come up for renewal because it's a chance between us and some of these corporates to really figure out how we go and structured deals that are fit for the purposes that these corporations have today and tomorrow. So we're encouraged by that. We think that the marketplace is changing very much, and we're looking forward to changing with it.Ravi ShankerUnderstood. That's really helpful. And maybe as a quick follow-up. I know there's been some commentary on kind of the domestic network on this call already. But just to put a fine point on it, I guess, given your U.S. domestic exposure relative to your network peers, I think there's been a lot of talk/speculation on the strength of the U.S. domestic traveler kind of -- any kind of definitive work that you can say about whether you're seeing that strength in demand continuing, the strength in RASM continuing? Are you starting to see cracks or people potentially kind of delaying or putting off trips domestically, that would be helpful?Robert D. IsomLook, I would say this, Ravi, what we see out there is demand for travel has never been probably more aspirational nor more intentional. That is we see not just people continuing to book further in advance. They're doing things where they want to go put more spending on credit cards. They want to go earn more miles because they're aspiring to take future trips that are out there. And they're keen to find more ways to go and do that, especially as they may be -- they're the companies may be requiring them to travel less. But there's also just a lot of intentionality about, right? Like what we've seen across our system is -- if you look at our traffic composition, it's not just that there's no more same-day trips, we've shifted about 3 points of our traffic mix from round trips to one ways where people are sometimes willing to pay a flexibility premium so that they can structure their trip and their fair product in the manner that they like. That's all to say that we do continue to see strength in the demand environment. It's year-over-year comps may be a little bit odd because purely idiosyncratic issues, right? Last year, domestic was benefited by the fact that long-haul markets were shut down, for example. But so far, we still see a really favorable demand environment, and we see at the actually unique customer level, a great degree of desire to travel.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Conor Cunningham of Melius Research.Conor T. CunninghamThe pushback I get on the free cash flow production on American is that it's somewhat temporary as CapEx kind of picks up again in the future and nothing to the magnitude that you had before in the refleeting phase. But why aren't we talking more about a long-term return on invested capital target? Like what goes into that thought process for you guys? Or maybe we're just too early in the balance sheet recovery phase. Just any thoughts there would be helpful.Unidentified Company RepresentativeListen, to start, we are really excited about our potential for free cash flow production in 2023. And you're right, this is a year where we have lower CapEx than an average year and lower CapEx than we wanted to have this year. We planned to spend a little bit more on aircraft CapEx. We just weren't able to get the deliveries in that we wanted. But this year, we will be something approaching $3 billion of free cash flow. That is inclusive of our labor agreements, which [do have] the potential of some sort of bonus pay. So we're proud of what we're producing this year. Next year, I think we're going to have a really nice free cash flow story, again, even though our aircraft CapEx does step up a little bit. And then longer term, I think this is a story that we -- hopefully we'll continue to talk about. We don't expect to have a need to go through a kind of massive CapEx cycle, again, we expect a more normalized cycle of capital expenditures. And in that world, we should be able to produce free cash flow each year. And as for metrics like a return on invested capital metric, yes, it is early in the recovery, but that's something that we would expect to talk more about in the coming years.Conor T. CunninghamOkay. And then you talked a fair bit about managed corporate travel. But I was just curious if you could talk a little bit about the small and medium business traveler out there. Obviously been a huge important segment for you guys in the near term. Just curious if there have been any changing in trends or tendencies given the choppy macro backdrop? Just any thoughts there would be helpful.Robert D. IsomYes, that's a great question. And probably it's a segment of travel, which is maybe neglected historically. Look, we see a lot of growth. I mean, clearly, it's not just that people are traveling less on contracted accounts, but we're seeing people who are taking business style trips or even blended trips who have no corporate -- no recognized contract and corporate affiliation. And really the -- probably the biggest thing to note there is that there's just a different set of buying criteria. There's value on flexibility, to my earlier point that a lot more of those non-contracted customers are -- will look to buy one-way trips in order to blend it or construct what they need to do. And also for those customers, there's a material -- they reflect a lot of the economic dynamics of the country. And Robert kind of alluded to it in his earlier remark to the top of this, so much of that demand is originating out of Sunbelt markets, Arizona, Texas, the Carolinas, Florida, places where we just have an inherent level of strength, and we endeavor to go build a fleet and the network structure to capitalize on.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Michael Linenberg of Deutsche Bank.Michael John LinenbergI have two quick ones here. Just Vasu, following on Helane's point on your answer to your question. What was the split between direct and indirect sales in 2019? Where are you today? And where do you think you are, say, 1.5 years, 2 years out?Vasu RajaWe are -- today, we are a little over 60% going direct, which is about a 10 to 12 points improvement versus where we were in quarter 1 of '19. We anticipate being about 10 points larger than that by quarter 2. Now importantly, we consider being sold through our new distribution technologies also as direct because we're able to provide -- for us, direct is really, how do we provide the right level of retail experience, selling and servicing to the customer? So we anticipate that will grow and potentially be as much as 80-plus percent of the airline by the end of the year. And where we certainly are doing all that we can to both encourage and incentivize people to make it something greater than that. So we're -- we remain pleased with how it's rolled out there to bolster that and to come back to some points that Robert and Ganesh mentioned. Part of what we're doing also is we're just -- we're simplifying what we sell. There's a lot of cases where we've created a lot of revenue products for a customer that -- for customer behaviors that just don't exist anymore, but required a lot of complications in servicing. Now we can be a lot more simple. We can provide flexibility in a lot more ways, which ultimately will be a thing that is great for any travel agency looking to serve a customer. But understandably, those are only made possible through contemporary technology. And so we anticipate that will also further fuel a change amongst customer behavior and ideally agency behavior, too.Michael John LinenbergYes. And just to clarify, you threw out 80%. But I guess, to be clear, it's almost -- that's obviously the NDC piece, but it's almost a bit of a hybrid direct because the GDSs are part of that solution, right? Am I -- is that my interpretation right?Robert D. IsomYes, that's correct. And you're very much right, Mike. And the reality is what the split is that takes us from 60 to 80 between direct and indirect, we don't entirely know yet. And if we look at it certainly from the last 3 or 4 weeks that we've been really producing content for new distribution channels. We've actually seen -- the primary growth outlook has actually been our app and our dot-com. So we -- as things change, it remains to be seen. And again, so much of this is dictated by the taste of the customer. Many of those noncontracted business customers that we -- that I spoke about in the last question, would love to go and purchase and consume our product through the app. So as our app improves, we anticipate there will be more and more of a shift.Michael John LinenbergGreat. That's great. And then, Devon, just a quick one. The $211 million profit sharing accrual, I guess that covers part of last year, but was that entirely incurred in the March quarter of 2023? And when you give us CASMx, is that CASMx fuel? Or is your -- is it CASMx fuel and profit sharing? I just want to clarify that.Devon E. MayOkay. So the CASMx guidance is just CASMx fuel. As for the $211 million, that is for our profit sharing program for the year ended March 31. We do have a profit churn program for 2023 that started January and goes for the entire 12 months of this year. So the $211 million is for effectively the 9 months -- last 9 months of 2022 and the first 3 months of 2023, and that is going to be paid out in May.Michael John LinenbergOkay. But was that incurred 100% in the March quarter of ...Devon E. MayNo, it wasn't. That was accrued throughout 2022.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker of JPMorgan.Jamie Nathaniel BakerSo Vasu, continuing on the corporate question. We understand the shift to NDC and credit is absolutely due to American for having the IT capabilities that not all of your competitors do. But what I can't reconcile is the way that you appear to be backing away from corporates, and that's based on high conversations with travel managers across the country, what I've seen in the press. I mean, it feels like the new philosophy is that you're not pursuing corporates with the same vigor as in the past because to me, that suggests the potential for share shift to United and Delta.Robert D. IsomAnd the lens to see a lot of our changes is through the actual user of the airline product -- the end consumer, and that's been a thing where. If you just think about the big history of the airlines, it's been hard just to mask the data and see technologically like who the customer is. We distribute our product based on whether it was a fast schedule or a low price. And so much of what we did was try to get people to go buy the faster schedule because there is a premium on it, but the changes have been meaningful. And none of the top 25 companies who were there in 2019 are any more than about 65% return to travel. However, the top customers, to my earlier point, are travel -- they're spending more on the airline than ever before. Now what that means for us is, especially in many cases where accounts aren't fulfilling or things like that. The nature of the corporate discount and the corporate contract is just changing. Maybe the best example that I can give is through many of our contracts over the years, we granted a level of loyalty status to customers. Well, now what we find is people are willing to actually -- especially noncontracted customers, many cases, the actual customer in the corporation is looking to go and earn more miles. They want more -- and when they earn miles, they want to be able to redeem them. They want to be able to get their status benefits. They want all of those things to take place. However, at our peak, we were giving away as much as 35% of our status members were through corporate exceptions. So that's a material amount when you think about it, that's actually curtailing the customer experience of those people who are most using our project -- our product. Some of whom work in the exact same corporation, but didn't travel as much before. They traveled less than some of the people who are receiving the exception. So a lot less of this is backing away from it, but the marketplace has changed. And there's something that we can do with a lot of these travel managers, which could be a much better experience for all of their customers through all of these changes, they can have access to, frankly, a much more seamless and simple servicing solution where they can also go and get some distribution cost savings, too. So look, change is never a thing, which is all the way easy, but it is something where our customers are speaking and they -- for them, it's necessary.Unidentified Company RepresentativeJamie, it's important for me to weigh into, hey, I know this is probably not the case. So the nature of your question suggests that's what our competitors are saying about us in the marketplace. And I'd just like to underscore that, yes, ""hey! look! we're going about things in a little bit different fashion"". We're looking to better service, offer less -- much less complex product seamlessness across the board. That benefits our relationship with the corporate customers. And we're out there in force, and we're making sure that we're appealing to our largest customers in the way that they want to do business. And if there are changes we need to make, we're going to do it. But right now, I think that more than anything else, what we're doing is actually having an impact and I'm pleased with where we're headed.Jamie Nathaniel BakerOkay. Very interesting. And Devon, just a quick question on the labor cost accruals. I want to make sure I understand correctly, those accruals -- well, do the accruals include any changes in profit sharing formula is anywhere else in the P&amp;L? Or is it simply a wage-based accrual? Given your answer to Mike's question, I think that's the right answer. It's just a wage-based exercise.Devon E. MayYes. So for what's in the second quarter, based on where we're at in negotiations and an assumption that we actually reached a tentative agreement this quarter, what we have in our guidance is an assumption that we will be at higher wages for our pilot work group, fourth quarter. Other work groups, we expect to reach tenant agreements later in the year. So they -- there's no impact from those groups in the second quarter. And as for profit sharing, yes, no expected profit sharing changes this quarter, but we do have an expectation for a change in profit sharing for those work groups in the back half of the year.Robert D. IsomAnd Jamie, this let me add on here, too. I know that there was a question about real P&amp;L items. But at the end of the day, we're going to end up with a contract that not only takes care of our pilots from a compensation perspective, but also quality of life. But the good news on that front is that, look, I think that we're going to be in a position where the changes that we're making are going to benefit not only our pilots, but the airline as well. So I look to changes that are being made is something that we'll be able to accommodate over time without a lot of impact to productivity.OperatorWe will now take questions from media. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Alison Sider of WSJ.Alison SiderYes. Just sort of curious on Boeing deliveries, kind of what's coming next, what you're hearing on Dreamliner deliveries and whether 737 late this summer are going to cause any issues? Are you having to thin out routes or cancel any routes or any kind of customer impact there?Robert D. IsomI'll start and Devon can give you some particulars. But between the MAXs and 787s, I think we have approximately 20 some-odd -- 23 deliveries planned for this year. And certainly, we've had some delays in that, and we are concerned about potential delays impacting the summer as well. It looks like we're going to be minimally impacted. But I'd just underscore this that any time that there's a delay in delivery, especially for an airline like American right now, where we've really built an efficient fleet over the years. If this is -- this results in a real impact to the airline and to our customers, we expected to fly those planes. We expect it to fly in on time. And when we have to make schedule changes. It impacts hundreds if not thousands of customers. Fortunately, with this latest issue with the MAX, we haven't had to make too many changes, but I'd just like to underscore this. Boeing has been a great partner. Airbus is a great partner. But look, at the end of the day, we need them to be incredibly reliable. We need them to be better than what they've been. And I communicate very frequently with the Boeing senior management team. And we need them to get their act together. We need a very, very strong Boeing, and we need them to be an incredible partner, and we have all the confidence that they'll get there. Devon, did you want to add anything else in terms of particulars?Devon E. MayJust a reminder, we have 4 787 deliveries this year, we took one in the first quarter. We expect the next 3 in the next 30 days or so. And on the MAXs, we have 17 remaining. Those will start to deliver over the next [handful] of weeks. The last two deliveries for this year are both neos and we got both of those in the [first] quarter.Alison SiderAnd if I could just follow up on sort of all the business travel talk on this call. You talked about it a lot, but we have heard companies and agencies sort of complaining about some of the changes American has made. Are you -- is it that -- are you seeing any market share shift? Or is it that it just doesn't really matter in the same way it might have at one point?Vasu RajaThis is Vasu. Thanks for the question. Look, from a given agency to or another, we may see a little bit. But in aggregate, we're really encouraged by the revenue trends that we see. Indeed, what we're seeing -- and while probably many people in traditional travel distribution are adjusting to these changes, but we also see in other cases, end consumers really responding favorably. So I mentioned earlier how many of our sales are going direct, but one of the things that we're encouraged by is by the end of this month, over 60% of our servicing transactions are coming digitally. And we anticipate by the end of the year, 100% of our transactions could be done digitally. And so that's a really meaningful change. Again, when you think about who those customers are that are increasingly traveling, whether they're traveling on a blended trip or a business trip or a leisure trip, is kind of a second order issue. The more that we can give them a contemporary retailing experience, like what they get anything else they buy, the more they value. We're seeing that over and over again. Our best channel for driving upsell is actually dot-com and the app. And it's consistent across our system. I'll give a for example. This will be relevant for you even for Jamie's comment. It's not just a function of our domestic marketplace. But when we're seeing 10 to 15 points of transaction share shift out of travel agencies and into the direct channel, it applies in our long-haul network, too. So London Heathrow, which, for us, has -- our peak flights in London Heathrow could -- the entirety of the premium cabin could have been sold outside of the dot-com at one point in time in the past. As we're -- as we finish the first quarter here, about 40% of our sales in London Heathrow premium cabin is coming through our direct channel. And so much of what's happening when they're doing that is -- when customers are buying that, is they're buying a product that they can go service themselves, they can change their seat assignment. They get the full value of not just the flexibility of the fair product, but the entirety of the servicing experience. So actually, so many of our changes we want to make that same thing available to all of our retail outlets. Wherever a customer wants to shop, we want them to be able to have that experience as well. And we know that many of our travel agency partners and our corporates want the exact same thing, but it calls for a different approach. And so we are doing a little bit of innovation to go and get it to a different approach. But ultimately, it's something which benefits the end customer, and it's going to create more choices for them and a (inaudible) more competition on how they buy travel.OperatorOur next question come from the line of Mary Schlangenstein of Bloomberg.Mary SchlangensteinI wanted to ask what are Americans plans for taking advantage of the waivers that were offered in New York and D.C. by the FAA? And then my second question is, Robert, you were talking about the park regional jets and said, potentially, you might be able to get 100s of them back in service by the end of this year. So realistically, how many of those planes do you think will return to use and will a large percentage of them perhaps never be that flying for American?Robert D. IsomLet me take that -- the last one first, which is, look, we would be flying virtually all of those planes today, if we could. And you take a look at small cities throughout the country. Vasu can give you a exhaustive list than this. But places like Green Bay and Santa Fe and Springfield, Missouri, Panama City, those are all places that would demand more service right now, and they really can only be served with regional jet. Now at the end of the day, we do that to connect into the larger part of our network, so -- which then impacts our hubs and our mainline aircraft and international flying and everything else. So it's a positive overall. But -- and to that end, the largest issue that we are facing is the shortfall in pilots. But we've seen great uptake in terms of people coming into the business because of some of the changes we made in compensation last year. And we're getting to the point where we have enough captains to build hours with first officers to get aircraft back up in the air. And when we take a look at where we'll eventually be, I would anticipate that, firstly, all those aircraft would be back into the system outside of the retirements that we would make for aging aircraft. So that's the answer to that. The first question again?Vasu RajaYes. Regarding New York FAA, I can start, Mary, and [Nate Gattan] may want to add as well. But the short answer is, we're really encouraged by what the FAA did. For us, we've taken some advantage of it, but for us, so much of our growth in New York is really in JFK flying long haul. I think Kennedy to Delhi or Kennedy to Doha. And so a lot of the benefits are more going to be borne out on people who fly shorter haul markets, higher frequency where those issues can come and bite them more. So when we go into our summer, our New York will be about 10 or 15 departures down versus what we had in the plan 3 or 4 months ago. But our overall seat capacity is up and across the [NEA], it is up and will continue to be up, as we both get more people to New York, through, New York and from New York.Unidentified Company RepresentativeI would just add, Robert mentioned it this morning, but we appreciate the FAA's leadership here to proactively take steps like this one to improve our air space. Certainly, we've seen since the pandemic that the New York area airports have struggled to return to normal operations. A lot of that is because of workforce challenges and the other system constraints at those airports. So this step, we welcomed -- Vasu mentioned our ability to take advantage of this is limited to some extent by NEA. I would just say, as a part of the NEA, we committed to capacity targets for New York airports, and we expect to fulfill those commitments. And I would just add since we're on the subject that we also want to commend the FAA for their guidance around commercial space launches, which will now take into consideration the impact that these -- the major launches, in particular, will help on air travel. It's a collaborative effort to address an issue that really challenges the system. And hopefully, it's something that's going to have wide-ranging benefits to the traveling public.Mary SchlangensteinAnd so it sounds like you're not taking full advantage of the slot waivers offered by the FAA. Is that correct?Vasu RajaMary, this is Vasu. That is correct. But that largely is due to the fact that we have less flying in the sort of high frequency markets that would most benefit from it.Mary SchlangensteinRight. But as Devon said, you're not cutting under the NEA?Vasu RajaNo. Indeed, we're actually growing seats. When you look at American Airlines this summer, we're growing seats indeed growing them at a greater rate than anybody else. The NEA is growing at a greater rate than anybody else, but that's really a response to consumer demand. And what you are seeing from us is flying fewer departures with more seats per departure. So we're able to, across the NEA operate schedules that we can deliver on.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Leslie Josephs of CNBC.Leslie JosephsJust curious what the time frame is for the new suites to the widebodies and I guess the (inaudible) here yet, are you still expecting those to debut in 2024? And if there's any change to the retrofit schedule as we've seen some issues with supply chain? And then also, do you have any detail on what the upsell has been to more premium cabins, whether it's more extra legroom seats or paid [for some] in business class?Vasu RajaLeslie, this is Vasu. I can answer both. So the first question, no change to plans. We anticipate taking -- installing the new seat on retrofits as planned and putting them on new deliveries as planned also, and we're really excited for it because it's going to be a really great product for our customers and a much simpler seat to go operate and deliver. To your second question about upsell rates. Look, a year or two ago, one of the questions in our mind to the earlier point about philosophically, how do we think about the long-haul business. But one of our great concerns was, what was the future of premium cabin, premium economy, things like that be? Now that we've had a year of seeing how people use this even in a world where we have less corporate contracts flying, we've been actually really encouraged and probably never been more encouraged by premium cabin performance. So if you look at us in the first quarter, our premium cabin revenues across the system are up 20% versus the same period in 2019, but our premium cabin seats are basically flat to what they were in 2019. That's the level of growth, which exceeds what we see in the economy cabin. And we see it categorically across every entity that's there. Domestic short haul, Caribbean, London even the Pacific, we see that. So actually, we've been very positively surprised by premium cabins by the flexibility and the upsell that ends up happening. And indeed, to my earlier comments through the call, the fact that so many customers are willing to go and purchase it is frankly what makes us more encouraged about any number of the commercial changes we're making.OperatorI would now like to turn the conference back to Robert Isom for closing remarks. Sir?Robert D. IsomThank you very much, and thanks for the interest. Look, we're really pleased with the progress that we've made at American. We set out with the goal of becoming a more reliable airline and becoming profitable. And we've done a remarkable job. Our team has done a remarkable job over the last year of getting us into this position. Industry-leading, operational reliability and then profitability, which is our fourth quarter in a row, record revenue production.When I take a look year-over-year, it's astounding that we're $2 billion in terms of pretax better than we were just a year ago. As we project out for the year, we anticipate record revenues in the second quarter. So all that is very positive, but I did ask questions about, why isn't our stock price performance moving in alignment with seemingly improved prospects? And in fact, our guidance for the year in terms of EPS, analysts would be 25% below where we're guiding.And I just say to that right now, no book. It's due to people not knowing the American story, possibly. And in that case, we've got to get out and do a better job of letting folks know what we see and where things are headed. And if it's not that, they don't believe our story. And in that case, we're just going to keep producing. Every quarter that we have a chance we're going to talk about those things that are most meaningful to creating shareholder value, and that's earnings and generating free cash flow. And we'll keep producing until people do believe.And for those that just want to see another chapter of the book and have some concerns about some issues that we may encounter over the next 3, 6 months or so, hey, we'll play that out too. We're really confident no matter what comes our way that will react in a fashion that still preserves our focus on making sure we run reliably and ultimately, profitably as well. So I appreciate everybody's interest, and we'll get back to work. Thanks very much.OperatorThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.]"

582,2cf562f6-dd9a-35b1-9f01-80d5913c68cf,AAL,2023-04-28,American Airlines Is Profiting More From Blended Travel Than It Did From Road Warriors,Skift,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-airlines-profiting-more-blended-180500764.html,1682618700,STORY,"['AAL', 'DAL']","[An American plane taxis with the San Francisco skyline in the background. (Luke Lai/Flickr) Luke Lai / FlickrThe rise in blended travel is reshaping American Airlines. Travelers who combine work and leisure into one trip are not only the fastest growing segment of the carrier’s business, but they are also driving changes to everything from how it sells flights to its loyalty program and big investment in premium seats.The Fort Worth, Texas-based carrier’s dramatic introduction of new so-called New Distribution Capability direct booking channels earlier this year is, in part, a response to blended travelers’ demand for more control and flexibility over their own travel. Those same travelers are driving a significant increase in membership to American’s loyalty program, AAdvantage, and new sign ups to its lucrative co-branded credit card agreements. In the first quarter, the airline recorded 60 percent more new AAdvantage accounts than four years earlier.“The more that we can give [customers] a contemporary retailing experience, like what they get [with] anything else they buy, the more value,” American Chief Commercial Officer Vasu Raja said during a first-quarter earnings call Thursday.Blended travel — when travelers tack on vacation to their business trips — has taken about 15 percentage points of share, for a total of about 35 percent of all bookings at American, from pure corporate travel, he said. And that shift is significantly more lucrative for the airline: “The blended yields we see coming in are 8-10 percent higher than the very business trips they replace.” Yields are essentially a proxy for airfares.Not everyone is happy with American’s shift to the New Distribution Capability or more direct sales. Travel agencies not using those American channels have said they are seeing significantly higher fares for the same flights on the airline than before the switch that occurred in April. However, that could be chalked up to the as-yet incomplete rollout of the new New Distribution Capability system, or travel agencies failing to adopt to the new technology required.Story continuesRaja said Thursday that more “selling and servicing tools” will be available to agents through the summer.But, in the end, American may care less and less what travel agents say. According to Raja, only 10 percent of revenue came through agency channels in the first quarter — a share that is shrinking as more travelers book directly, particularly through American’s website and app.“The marketplace has changed,” American CEO Robert Isom said of corporate travel.International LeadsInternational longhaul travel is in the midst of the surge in pent-up demand that American and other U.S. airlines saw domestically last year. As such, American is focused on recovering its longhaul network in the second quarter. Capacity in longhaul markets, for example to London, São Paulo, or Tokyo will increase 82 percent compared to last year; overall system capacity will be up 3.5-5.5 percent year-over-year.“This summer in longhaul is going to be a seasonally, and probably historically, strong longhaul summer,” Raja said.Competitors Delta Air Lines and United Airlines have similarly reported record demand for longhaul travel this summer. All three major U.S. carriers are deploying as much capacity as they can on flights to Asia, Europe, and South America. In the second quarter, Delta and United will fly 43 percent and 40 percent more longhaul capacity, respectively, than they did last year, according to Diio by Cirium schedules. American? Just 9.5 percent more.American’s longhaul growth is so much mote muted because one critical fact: It has fewer of the planes that fly long routes than it did four years ago. The airline is down roughly 45 widebody aircraft due to the combination of its pandemic-era decision to retire its Airbus A330s and Boeing 767s early, and Boeing’s issues delivering new 787s on time. Delta retired fewer widebody planes during the pandemic and has benefitted from only having Airbus models on order; United did not retire any planes during the crisis.“The longhaul business … it’s the most volatile part of a relatively volatile business,” Raja said. “It’s the most capital-intensive part of a capital-intensive business and it can be very complex operationally too. So what we found is that actually by being a very focused operator, a simplified fleet, things like that, that enables us to go and respond to demand a lot more appropriately.”American has outstanding firm orders for only 33 787s leaving it likely with fewer widebody jets for years to come. The airline also has an order for 50 long-range Airbus A321XLR jets that it could use to launch new, thinner routes to Europe or South America — think Philadelphia to Berlin, or Miami to Recife, Brazil — during the second half of the decade.In addition, Raja repeated that American is focused on flying travelers to partners’ hubs where they can connect on to other international destinations rather than serving every possible point with its own aircraft. He cited increased frequencies to London Heathrow, a hub for partner British Airways, from American’s mega Charlotte and Dallas-Fort Worth hubs as an example.Constructive DemandOverall travel demand, including domestic, is “strong” but also “constructive” heading into the summer, American Chief Financial Officer Devon May said Thursday. That was a more tepid endorsement of the sentiment for future travel than other U.S. airline executives. However, for American that is likely more a measure of the fact that domestic travel demand — it’s largest business segment — is simply flat compared to last year’s torrid growth.Take total unit revenues, which the airline measures by the amount of revenue generate by each seat mile it flies, are forecast to fall on a year-over-year basis for the first time in more than a year in the second quarter. American anticipates a 2-4 percent decline in total unit revenues compared to 2019.And domestic revenues will likely be helped by the numerous constraints on U.S. air travel this summer. The shortage of captains, particularly at regional airlines, has roughly 150 aircraft in American’s regional fleet still parked. And air traffic control staffing issues in New York mean American and partner JetBlue Airways will fly fewer flights — but more seats according to Raja — through JFK, LaGuardia, and Newark airports this summer than last year.And the NumbersAmerican reported a $33 million net profit excluding special items in the first quarter. That equals a 3.7 percent operating margin, which was significantly better than United’s negative 0.4 percent margin and slightly behind Delta’s 4.1 percent margin. Revenues jumped 37 percent year-over-year to $12.2 billion, total unit revenues increased 25.4 percent, and unit costs excluding fuel decreased 1.4 percent.The cost savings are significant given the airline industry’s rapid run up in expenses since Covid. American, however, does not expect the declines to continue. Citing an expected new — and costly — contract with pilots, May said unit costs excluding fuel will increase 3.5-5.5 percent compared to 2019 in the second quarter.Looking ahead, American anticipates another profit in the second quarter with a forecasted 11-13 percent operating margin.Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

However, the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12,198.9 million.In the March-end quarter, passenger revenues, accounting for the bulk of the top line (91.1%), increased to $11,103 million from $7,818 million a year ago, driven by strong air-travel demand mainly on the domestic front. Cargo revenues decreased 38.7% to $223 million. Other revenues climbed 20.4%.Total revenue per available seat miles (a key measure of unit revenue: TRASM) increased to 18.75 cents from 14.95 cents a year ago. Passenger revenue per available seat miles rose 30.1% to 17.08 cents, driven by buoyant air-travel demand. Consolidated yield increased 20.9%.Reflecting the uptick in air-travel demand, consolidated traffic (measured in revenue passenger miles) rose to 52,014 million from 44,290 million a year ago. To cater to this increased demand, capacity (measured in average seat miles) expanded to 65,006 million from 59,533 million.

The downfall was due to declines in the volume of 25% in Integrated Capacity Solutions (ICS), 5% in Intermodal (JBI) and 17% in Final Mile Services (FMS), respectively. A decline of 17% in revenue per load in Truckload (JBT) added to the woes.Revenue declines in ICS, JBI, FMS and JBT were partially offset by Dedicated Contract Services revenue growth of 13%.

During today's conference call, we will discuss our first quarter 2023 results and our outlook for the remainder of the year. After our prepared comments, we will host a question-and-answer period.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the O'Reilly Auto Parts first quarter conference call. Participating on the call with me this morning are our Co-Presidents, Brad Beckham and Brent Kirby; and Jeremy Fletcher, our Chief Financial Officer. Greg Henslee, our Executive Chairman; and David O'Reilly, our Executive Vice Chairman, are also present on the call. I'd like to begin our call today by congratulating Team O'Reilly on a strong start to 2023. Delivering such consistent strong results requires an unrelenting commitment to excellent customer service from our team of over 86,000 professional parts people across the U.S. and Mexico. I am extremely grateful for the hard work our team puts in each and every day. Our first quarter results were highlighted by a robust 10.8% increase in comparable store sales as our team continued to deliver outstanding growth on top of strong performance in the prior year. These top line results exceeded our expectations and demonstrate O'Reilly strength on both the professional and DIY sides of our business. Team O'Reilly charged out of the gate this year, highly motivated to execute on our initiatives to invest in our people, further refine and enhance our business tools and aggressively grow our market share. We have been very pleased with the momentum our teams have generated in 2023. Our team members and our culture remain our greatest assets. And our ongoing commitment to build on both of these competitive advantages is paying clear dividends through the sustained strong results delivered quarterly quarter after quarter. Team O'Reilly remains highly focused on expense control and prudent capital deployment, enabling us to translate our sales gains and growth into outstanding returns for our shareholders. For the first quarter, our diluted earnings per share of $8.28 represents a 15% increase over the prior year. We are increasing our full year 2023 EPS guidance to a range of $36.56 -- $36.50 to $37 even, reflecting our first quarter outperformance and shares repurchased since our last call. At the midpoint of the revised range, we now expect our full year EPS to increase 10% over 2022. Before I turn the call over to Brad and Brent to provide additional detail on the first quarter, I'd like to reiterate our confidence in the favorable outlook for both our industry and our company for the balance of 2023. We view our first quarter top line results as a clear reflection of the strong demand backdrop in our industry. We also remain firm in our belief that consumers will continue to prioritize the maintenance and repair of their existing vehicles in the face of economic pressures in order to avoid taking on a payment for a higher-priced, newer vehicle. This value proposition compelling consumers to reinvest in their existing vehicles continues to be further supported by elevated new and used vehicle prices. Encouragingly, the U.S. consumer remains resilient with low unemployment rates, wage growth and stabilization in fuel prices, supporting both consumer health and the steady growth in miles driven. While we still maintain an element of caution with regard to the outlook for the overall U.S. economy and potential for heightened economic pressures, we believe the current market dynamics combine to provide a strong backdrop for demand in our industry. Even more importantly, we believe our strategic competitive advantages uniquely position our company to capitalize on the positive fundamentals of the automotive aftermarket and grow at a faster rate than the industry as a whole. To wrap up my comments, I want to again thank Team O'Reilly for continuing to uphold our culture of excellent customer service. Your commitment to our culture, our fellow team members and our customers drives our success and makes you the best team in the business. Lastly, I would also like to extend our gratitude to our shareholders. This past week marked our 30th anniversary as a public company with our initial public offering in April of 1993. The O'Reilly family had the wisdom and foresight to recognize the benefits of obtaining capital through the public markets to grow our business as well as extending ownership opportunities to our team members to allow us all to share in the company's success. Our incredible financial performance as a public company is a true testament to the dedication of our team. In each of the 30 years since 1993, our team has delivered growth in both sales and EPS, driving returns to our shareholders in excess of 22% per year on a compounded annual basis. We see a bright future for O'Reilly and are thankful for the trust and confidence our shareholders have placed in the O'Reilly team over the years. I'll now turn the call over to Brad Beckham. Brad?Brad W. BeckhamThanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I would also like to begin with a sincere thank you to Team O'Reilly for their commitment to our continued success through providing excellent customer service. We have set an incredibly high bar of performance, and I could not be more excited about the momentum our team drove in the first quarter by executing on the fundamentals of our business and taking care of our customers every day. Our ambitious goals require dedication and hard work from every area of our organization, and I'm extremely proud of the way Team O'Reilly continues to deliver. Now I'd like to take some time to walk through the details of our sales performance for the first quarter and what we saw on each side of the business. I'll start with the professional side of our business, which was the outperformer in the quarter and the driver of our above-expectation results. Our professional sales growth on a comparable basis exceeded 20% for the quarter, and we were very pleased to see outperformance steadily throughout the quarter. The growth trend in our professional business continues to be very strong even in light of increasingly challenging comparisons, and these compounded gains are the direct result of our team's outstanding execution. For us, the bread and butter of our execution on the professional side of our business is always ensuring we have the right part available for our customers when and where they need it and providing efficient delivery service so that a customer can get cars off the rack and turn their base, but it doesn't stop there. Providing top-notch customer service also includes our professional parts people regularly visiting our customers and spending time in their shops, making sure we are doing all we can to deliver value as a business partner, whether it be educating them on our store team and service, our products, equipping that shop with shop management tools or providing training to their technicians. Focusing on these fundamentals and building long-term loyal relationships are the key drivers of our robust professional sales results. We continue to expect our professional business to be the stronger driver of our growth in 2023, but also see exciting opportunities on the DIY side of our business to win share in the marketplace. Turning to our DIY business. We were generally pleased with our results for the quarter with our teams delivering positive comparable store sales growth each month of the quarter driven by solid results in January and February mixed with some weather-related pressure in March. The first quarter has historically seen the most weather-driven volatility in our business as we see impacts both from the type and severity of winter weather and from the timing of the onset of spring weather. Our DIY customers often take on jobs in their driveways and will take advantage of the first warm days of spring to perform repair, maintenance and tune up items that were temporarily on hold during the winter. The pace of our DIY business in the first quarter was definitely impacted by this weather volatility as unseasonably cool, wet weather across much of the country pressured our March results. However, spring finally sprung as we turned into the calendar into April, and we have been pleased with the solid rebound we have seen in our DIY business. The DIY improvement, coupled with continued robust professional sales growth, has resulted in a strong start to the second quarter. As we have said more than a few times over the years, we don't like to talk about weather since it's out of our control. But on balance, so far in 2023, the volatility in our sales results lines up pretty much exactly with what we would expect, given the timing of spring. Now I would like to provide some color on our ticket count and average ticket performance. Strong ticket count comps on the professional side of our business were partially offset by pressure to DIY ticket counts in the quarter. Directionally, our ticket counts performed as we expected with the gap wider than our original outlook because of the outperformance in our professional business and, to a lesser degree, the weather headwind to DIY in March. We saw mid-single-digit average ticket growth supported by same-SKU inflation at similar levels and in line with our expectations for the quarter. Our benefit from same-SKU inflation was primarily the result of year-over-year benefit of price increases we passed along in 2022 as opposed to significant incremental cost increases in the first quarter. As a result of this dynamic, we expect first quarter will be the most significant benefit to average ticket increases from same-SKU inflation and continue to expect this benefit to moderate as we move throughout the year and compare against higher price level stemming from price increases in the first half of this year. To wrap up my comments on sales, I would like to highlight our sales guidance and full year outlook. We are maintaining our full year comparable store sales guidance range of 4% to 6% and total sales guidance of $15.2 billion to $15.5 billion. After incorporating above plan first quarter results, we are trending above our full year midpoint and are encouraged by the strength we have seen thus far. However, even though we outpaced our sales plan in the first quarter, our original expectations had already anticipated some of the strength we saw in Q1. As we discussed when we laid out our expectations on our last call, we expect first half 2023 comps to be stronger as a result of the year-over-year same-SKU inflation benefit as well as easier ticket count comparisons on both sides of our business. While we are pleased with our strong sales performance thus far in 2023, we're always cautious about overreacting to first quarter results, especially in light of the weather volatility we can see at the beginning of the year. Ultimately, as Greg noted, we believe industry dynamics are positive and supportive of strong demand moving forward. And we are optimistic about our ability to drive strong results as we move through the year. Rest assured, our teams are focused on taking share in every market and on both sides of the business regardless of any challenges that may arise. Our teams do not waste energy focusing on things outside of our control. We work in a people, service and relationship business. And we spend 100% of our time focusing on and executing the basic fundamentals of our business. Ownership and everything we can control with our team and our service levels is at the core of our culture and in turn, everything we do. Now I'd like to discuss our SG&amp;A performance in the quarter. SG&amp;A as a percentage of sales was 31.7%, a deleverage of 14 basis points from the first quarter of 2022. Our first quarter SG&amp;A results included a planned approximately 35 basis point headwind from the resumption of our annual in-person leadership conference in February. As we discussed on our conference call in February, this event was our first in-person conference since 2020, and as such, was a headwind to our first quarter SG&amp;A on a year-over-year comparison basis. However, this spend is one of the absolute best investments we make in our team as we celebrated our successes from 2022, shared best practices and strategies for better serving our customers, expanded product knowledge, perpetuated our culture and energized our team to be the dominant supplier of auto parts in each of their markets in 2023. As noted on our last call, we have also invested in our team through the enhanced paid time-off program we rolled out at the end of 2022, which resulted in a $28 million SG&amp;A charge in the fourth quarter of 2022. On a full year basis, the total cost for this program in 2023 will be roughly comparable to our fourth quarter 2022 charge that creates a year-over-year headwinds in the first 3 quarters of 2023 but a positive comparison in the fourth quarter of this year. For the first quarter, our SG&amp;A per store increased 9.6%, which is well above our expected full year run rate in part because of the year-over-year impacts from both our leadership conference and the team member benefit plan transition. In total, our SG&amp;A spend in the first quarter was above our original plan coming into the quarter driven by incremental costs related to stronger-than-anticipated sales but is in line with our expectations given the sales performance. As we move forward in 2023, we will continue to execute our plans targeted at strengthening our team member experience and benefits, upgrading our vehicle fleet, refreshing and improving our store image and appearance and deploying incremental technology projects as well as investments in infrastructure. We are investing in our teams and our customer service levels from a position of strength. And we'll continue to capitalize on opportunities we see to accelerate share gains, drive long-term profitable growth and generate strong returns on our investments. These initiatives are on track through the first quarter, and we have continued confidence in our ability to deliver on these items as planned. For the full year, we expect to see SG&amp;A per store increase of approximately 4.5% at the top end of our original guide of 4% to 4.5% as a result of incremental spend in the first quarter to support our robust sales growth. Finally, we are maintaining our operating margin guidance range at 19.8% to 20.3% of sales. To conclude my comments, I want to once again thank Team O'Reilly for their dedication to our success. I am very fortunate to continue to spend time in our stores with our team members and with our customers, both DIY and professional, and can assure you our teams remain focused on relentless execution of our customer service fundamentals. Our team has a proven playbook that has been developed over the 65 years O'Reilly Auto Parts has been serving customers. And our team members are passionate about upholding our standards of service and professionalism. Thank you, Team O'Reilly, and great job. Now I'll turn the call over to Brent.Brent G. KirbyThanks, Brad. I would also like to give my thanks to Team O'Reilly for your performance in the first quarter. These outstanding results are a testament to your efforts and focus on our culture of providing excellent customer service. Now I will take some time to walk through our first quarter gross margin results, discuss our inventory position and provide color on our store growth and capital investments. Beginning with gross margin. Our first quarter gross margin of 51% was an 84 basis point decrease from the first quarter of 2022, but in line with our expectations. As we noted in our last call, we anticipated comparison pressures in the first 2 quarters of this year. Our results in the first quarter hit those expectations, and I will now provide some color on what we saw. First, our year-over-year gross margin results for the first quarter were impacted by the rollout of our professional pricing initiative last year, which began in the middle of the first quarter of 2022. We fully lapped the higher gross margin run rate in the first half of the quarter and will be apples-to-apples in the comparison for the remainder of 2023. Secondly, we have a headwind as we compare against the final roll-through of our historic LIFO accounting benefit in the first quarter of 2022, which we noted at the time was approximately $10 million in that quarter. Both of these headwinds were in line with our expectations for the quarter and will not impact gross margin moving forward. In addition to the anticipated pressure from the first quarter in pro pricing and LIFO, we also saw continued gross margin pressure from a higher mix of professional business, some of which was planned and some resulting from our outperformance versus our expectations as that side of the business continues to grow faster but also carries a lower gross margin. However, product margin on both sides of our business has been slightly better than expected, resulting from positive acquisition cost benefits, offsetting some of the pressure from the higher-than-planned mix of professional sales. While we are pleased with our results so far this year, we remain cautious regarding the cost outlook for the remainder of 2023, including the prospect for incremental reductions to acquisition cost. Our supply chain partners continue to face anticipated broad inflationary pressures, and we expect to see a relatively stable cost environment with potential for puts and takes in both directions. Pricing in the industry has remained rational. If we see future increases in product acquisition or other costs, we are confident in our ability to pass those cost increases through in selling price. We are maintaining our full year gross margin guidance of 50.8% to 51.3% and expect our quarterly gross margin performance for the remainder of the year to be consistent on a quarter-to-quarter basis and within that range. Inventory per store finished the quarter at $754,000, which was up 14% from this time last year but flat compared to the beginning of the year. We continue to track toward our planned inventory per store increase of 2% by the end of 2023 and are constantly working to deploy our inventory at the optimal position across our distribution centers and hub stores in our tiered distribution network. Our supply chain and store in-stock positions are as strong as they have been in several years. And the diligent work that our merchandise inventory management and distribution teams have done to deploy the best possible local inventory assortment is reaping benefits and strong top line results. Our AP to inventory ratio at the end of the first quarter was 133% and continues to be supported by strong sales volumes and inventory turns. Net inventory investment remained flat compared to the beginning of the year, and we remain pleased with the returns generated from ensuring that we are the industry leader in product availability. Turning to our progress on store growth and capital investments. We successfully opened 60 new stores during the first quarter. Within these openings, there are a few milestones that I would like to highlight. First, we kicked off the year with our entrance into Maryland, marking our 48th state. Not long after, we celebrated the opening of our 6,000th store on February 23 with a ribbon-cutting ceremony in Fort Gibson, Oklahoma. Finally, we successfully opened our first 2 stores and a distribution center in Puerto Rico in March. We are truly proud of these accomplishments and would like to thank and congratulate all of the teams involved in achieving these milestones. Growth is always hard work, and Team O'Reilly does an outstanding job of rolling up their sleeves and ensuring that each O'Reilly store is a model of excellent customer service and industry-leading product availability. Our team's ability to perpetuate our culture and execute on our dual market strategy is the reason our store growth continues to drive premium returns on the capital that we invest. Our team is marching ahead toward our goal of 180 to 190 net new store openings for 2023. We still have an ambitious year ahead of us in terms of growth initiatives and capital investments to fund those plans. Our capital expenditures for the first quarter were $223 million. And our projects and initiatives are still on track for us to hit our capital expenditure guidance of $750 million to $800 million. Progress on our distribution center in Guadalajara, Mexico remains on schedule for an opening this summer. We are excited about the opportunity that this new facility will create for us in terms of enhanced service levels to the Guadalajara metropolitan area as well as future store growth across Mexico for many years to come. Before I turn the call over to Jeremy, I want to once again thank Team O'Reilly for their accomplishments during the quarter and for their enthusiasm for excellent customer service. It is a real privilege to be a part of the best team in the automotive aftermarket. Now I will turn the call over to Jeremy.Jeremy Adam FletcherThanks, Brent. I would also like to thank Team O'Reilly for their hard work and the outstanding professionalism as they deliver excellent customer service every day. Now we will cover some additional details on our first quarter results and guidance for the remainder of 2023. For the quarter, sales increased $412 million driven by a 10.8% increase in comparable store sales and a $68 million noncomp contribution from stores opened in 2022 and 2023 that have not yet entered the comp base. For 2023, we continue to expect our total revenues to be $15.2 billion to $15.5 billion. Brent covered our gross margin performance and guidance already, but I would like to remind everyone that we view our reported GAAP gross margin as the best measurement of our gross margin performance and do not view the normal application of LIFO as a discrete charge in the evaluation of gross margin. The comparison headwind in first quarter of 2023 resulting from the $10 million LIFO benefit recognized in the first quarter of 2022 is unique to our first quarter comparisons. And we will not have a discrete LIFO impact for the remainder of 2023. Our first quarter effective tax rate was 23.7% of pretax income, comprised of a base rate of 24.3% reduced by a 0.6% benefit from share-based compensation. This compares to the first quarter 2022 rate of 23.9% of pretax income, which was comprised of a base rate of 24.3% reduced by a 0.4% benefit from share-based compensation. Our first quarter effective tax rate was in line with our expectations. For the full year of 2023, we continue to expect an effective tax rate of 22.9%, comprised of a base rate of 23.4% reduced by a benefit of 0.5% from share-based compensation. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate is expected to be lower than the other 3 quarters due to the tolling of certain tax periods. Variations in the tax benefit from share-based compensation can create fluctuations in our quarterly tax rate. Now we will move on to free cash flow and the components that drove our results. Free cash flow for the quarter of 2023 was $486 million versus $579 million for the first quarter of 2022 with the decrease driven by higher capital expenditures in '23 versus the prior year. For 2023, our expected free cash flow guidance remains unchanged at a range of $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion. Moving on to debt. We finished the first quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.96x, which is up compared to our end of 2022 ratio of 1.84x with the increase driven by borrowings on our revolving credit facility. We continue to be below our leverage target of 2.5x and plan to prudently approach that number over time. We continue to be pleased with the execution of our share repurchase program. And during the first quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares at an average share price of $819.06 for a total investment of $1.1 billion. Subsequent to the end of the quarter and through our press release yesterday, we repurchased 0.2 million shares at an average share price of $864.44 for a total investment of $137 million. The excise tax on share repurchases that was implemented as part of the Inflation Reduction Act became effective for all share repurchases beginning January 1, 2023, and is assessed at 1% of the aggregate fair market value of net share repurchases. We incurred $11.1 million in excise tax during the first quarter, which is reflected directly in our balance sheet and retained earnings. We remain very confident that the average repurchase price, inclusive of the current excise tax cost, is supported by the discounted expected future cash flows of our business. And we continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning excess capital to our shareholders. As a reminder, the EPS guidance outlined by Greg earlier includes the impact of shares repurchased through this call but does not include any additional share repurchases. Finally, before I open up our call to your questions, I would like to again thank the entire O'Reilly team for their commitment to our customers and our company. This concludes our prepared comments. At this time, I would like to ask Ali, the operator, to return to the line, and we will be happy to answer your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from Scot Ciccarelli with Truist Securities.Scot CiccarelliLooks like you had a pretty big acceleration in commercial sales. So should we be thinking about that as a function of just continued share increases? Or is there something else potentially helping drive that? And then related to that question, do the improved sales results potentially tempt you guys to make additional price investments in certain markets where you're seeing positive results of prior price investments?Brad W. BeckhamScot, this is Brad. I'll take the kind of the first part of your question there on professional. As you know, our business, we're really excited about really a lot of things that Brent talked about. Me speaking from the store side of the house and looking at our supply chain, we're just incredibly proud of the way that our supply chain teams have found resolve over this last year and the last many years. And to Brent's point, we're in a better in-stock and ship rate percentage as we've been in a long time. And I can speak for our store operators and our sales team just -- that's just an incredible accomplishment and was a large part of what drove our -- what we feel like our share gains in our top line, especially on the professional side of the business, that being such a high service, high touch side of the business. And so yes, the supply chain, continued execution on properly staffing our stores, get the customer service out there calling on those customers. Just all the tools that come out of our toolbox that we talk all the time, we feel really good and are really excited about how we started the year from a professional standpoint. And, Scot, on the pricing side of it, as you know, we've talked for basically a year now that we've lapped this thing, we've lapped pro price initiative. We feel really good about that investment we made just over a year ago. But as we've talked for several quarters now, that was a onetime decision. We felt like we had an opportunity to move our overall matrix down to a point that we could really -- felt like we were really competing better with the 2-step competitors, the independent competitors that kind of, by historical, have been somewhat cheaper than us in some of our retail and larger closing competitors. So we feel really good about what we did. But around here, it's kind of back to business as usual. We've lapped this thing. It's in the past, and we have no plans for a second round.OperatorOur next question is coming from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.Christopher Michael HorversSo I wanted to follow up on the question, on Scot's question. So first on the DIY side, do you think your DIY performance was in line with the market? And any gander on how much you outgrew the professional market in the first quarter?Jeremy Adam FletcherChris, this is Jeremy. Great question. I wish we had a real definitive answer on the DIY side of the business. Some of that, we're just going to -- we'll have to wait to see how maybe some others talk about it. We think more broadly speaking, over several quarters, our teams have been executing well. And we've had opportunities, and we think that we're a share gain on a net balance on any given quarter on the DIY side of our business. And to be fair, like we think that there's share that we should be gaining. We think there's entitlement out there that we haven't addressed and need to continue to work to get our fair share of the marketplace. In a quarter like first quarter, it's a little bit more challenging. Obviously, there's volatility on that side of our business from the perspective of spring, and those are things that we can pay attention and watch pretty closely, but feel good given what we could see just in the daily, weekly reports from the weather that we saw rolled in, the DIY was solid for us in the first quarter. On the professional side of the business, Brad's talked to it already. In some respects, we're absolutely picking up share there. And more fragmented on that side, hard to identify where it has been, but really think that a lot of the things that Brad pointed to, for sure, the momentum we gained last year with the professional pricing but now even more how exceptionally our teams are executing against that and providing direct service, we think that, that's just -- that's a function of our business model and the great team we've got are running our business well.Christopher Michael HorversAnd so 2 quick follow-ups. First, do you think that any of the -- you getting back in stock on the inventory side is driving some of that pressure in addition to pricing? And if so, when did you get back in stock? And secondly, on the gross margin, given that you should have some freight costs that are capitalized that are coming down, why shouldn't we see better gross margin performance sequentially as the year progresses?Brent G. KirbyYes. Chris, this is Brent. And just really to kind of tag on to what Jeremy and Brad have already said, really, when you think about our business and how we go to market, whether it's on the professional side or the retail side, it's really first and foremost, is 3 ingredients, right? It's service, it's parts availability and price is the third. And what we saw and what we felt really good about in this quarter was the level of service and execution that our teams were delivering out there. In terms of product availability and in-stock, we've talked about that. It's gotten progressively better over the last 12 months. We've seen suppliers continue to get healthier, and we've seen them finally be the healthiest they've been in several years, which has obviously helped contribute to our position. But we've also been aggressive like we talked about in terms of our investment in inventory and how we use it across -- we have a tier distribution model with a big DC footprint, a big hub store footprint. And really the placement of that inventory and our ability to get the part there quicker than our competition is really what helps us win there. So it's as much about supplier availability as it is our execution and how we deploy that inventory across our network of stores and DCs. In terms of freight cost, we -- and acquisition cost on product, we've continued to see some international transportation costs come down even some to pre-COVID levels. Domestic transportation sill have some inflationary factor to it. That's something to consider. We have a lot of suppliers that have raw material cost pressure, labor cost pressure, different things like that. So that's one of the reasons we remain cautious there. We're always going to do everything we can to bring the best cost of goods into our model and compete effectively. But that's how I would wrap it up for you in terms of your question.OperatorOur next question is coming from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI.Gregory Scott MelichI wanted to follow up a little bit more on the top line trends on both sides. So DIY, it sounds like came back in April with the weather better. I just want to make sure that's back in terms of ticket counts are positive, and you're still getting sort of mid-single-digit inflation mix?Jeremy Adam FletcherYes, Greg, I wouldn't say that the ticket counts are necessarily positive from an ongoing trend stability standpoint. I don't want to parse too closely into just a few weeks here in April as it relates to that. Our full year expectation is that we would see kind of net on balance, a little bit of pressure on the DIY ticket counts that was reflected in our guidance. And so just maybe around your specific question for us that we did see the DIY business rebound in April. Now for sure, some of that we interpret cautiously the first really nice week in the spring or weaken spring hit us in April, and there's some of that, that we carried over out of first quarter and picked it up there. But feel good that, that's kind of stabilized at this stage and really haven't changed our outlook or expectations for the balance of the year from a DIY perspective.Gregory Scott MelichGot it. And then secondly, on SG&amp;A, just help -- I know it was -- it grew, I guess, what, 14%. You called out some of the things that drove that, planned and unplanned. What is making you for the full year think that SG&amp;A per store now is at the higher end? Is it wage costs? Is there something else going on (inaudible) the high end?Jeremy Adam FletcherYes. No, Greg, really, the only change there from our beginning of the year outlook, which was a range of 4 to 4.5, is as sales did exceed our expectations in the first quarter. We have some incremental costs associated with that, especially on the professional side of the business. We're running more trucks out for more hours, those types of things. And then in addition to that, just some of the incentive pressures there. So most of what we would attribute that small change is the sales are running a little bit better than what we would have expected and would plan to be above midpoint there, but we have kept that operating profit guide where it's at. And the personal spend is really just reflective of that.Gregory Scott MelichGot it. And then last is just private label. Do you have an update on percentage penetration? Any signs of trade down as you get more volatility in DIY?Brent G. KirbyYes, Greg, I can speak to that. We really honestly continue to see our proprietary brand penetration continue to grow. It's slightly north of 50%, which we're really proud of. We continue to build very competitive offerings with good, better, best progression through the lines across all our proprietary brands. And they continue to gain traction with our customers, both DIY and professional. So we're extremely proud of that. I think -- the second part of your question, could you ask that again?Gregory Scott MelichYes. Just is there any sign of trade down? So I know you have -- you're building out the program of private label, and that's still gaining traction. Are you finding consumers getting a little more cash-constrained and trading down within that?Brent G. KirbyYes. That's something we watch very closely, Greg. And honestly, we have not seen that. I know some retailers are talking about that. We've actually seen a slight gravitation from the better to the best, believe it or not. And again, we think that's probably just the strength of the offering and consumers wanting quality when they have to repair their vehicle. But we've not seen any material evidence of any trade down at this point.Gregory Scott MelichThat's great. Congrats, and good luck.Brent G. KirbyThanks, Greg. Appreciate it.OperatorOur next question is coming from Bret Jordan with Jefferies.Bret David JordanCould you give us some quick color on regional performance, maybe the spread between the best and the worst and talk about what you saw nationally? Obviously, the weather was different east versus west.Brad W. BeckhamYes. Bret, this is Brad. Really, we were fairly pleased overall with how consistent most every market performed. As you can imagine, you've heard from others in red, there's obviously some pressure more on the DIY side on the West Coast. Some of that rolled in a little bit to the center part of the country. But honestly, even though there was puts and takes, the puts and takes kind of changed per geography based upon what the weather was doing, especially on the DIY side on the weekends specifically. So it kind of moved around a little bit. And really surprisingly, even for March where we had the most pressure that there wasn't just huge swings. There was just a little bit more pressure broad-based. And as you know, we don't have quite the concentration of stores that some do in the true Northeast other than New England. But overall, really our northern markets performed pretty well.Bret David JordanOkay. Great. And the next question is that, obviously, you've entered Maryland. Could you talk a little bit about your -- maybe the cadence of Mid-Atlantic fill in, in the Northeast? Obviously, another 100-plus stores to open this year, and maybe what's your thoughts as far as distribution infrastructure that might be needed to come into that market.Jeremy Adam FletcherYes, Bret, great question. This is Jeremy. We are excited about the inroads that we have made in the Northeast. We entered there originally in 2012 with the acquisition of VIP, and then we bought Bond a few years later and opened our distribution center in Boston. So we're kind of closing the gap to those markets that we haven't been in already. I think as much as anything, we've been excited about the teams and the culture we've been able to both inherent from our acquisitions, but also grow from as a platform in those markets. So very attractive for us. We are cautious on how aggressively we pursue any individual market. One of the benefits that we have with our large footprint is we can continue to grow really across that footprint. And that helps us to be able to identify the strong store teams that we need to be successful in our growth, and that's true up in the Northeast as well. But we've been aggressively working to acquire the properties that we'll need and to work to build the teams. And you'll continue to see our growth up there and get to a level of density. I think it's going to be consistent with a lot of our markets.Gregory D. JohnsonBret, this is Greg. I mean, to speak to the DC question specifically, obviously, with growth in that market and just the growth that we've experienced over the past couple of years, the really unplanned growth, we are looking very hard at our DC capacity and our DC infrastructure. And we've talked about opening the DC in Mexico to support our growth down there. We're also looking across the country as a whole and where we have capacity issues in the Northeast is one of those markets. And we'll continue to evaluate those markets and enhance our DC presence as needed to continue to support our growth.OperatorOur next question is coming from Zack Fadem with Wells Fargo.Zachary Robert FademCould you talk about the level of DIY comp you think you left on the table due to weather in March? And then big picture as we lapped the unit pressures last year for DIY, to what extent do you think the DIY industry has now normalized back to a more typical low single-digit unit decline? Or is there any reason to believe DIY units can actually inflect positive, given the macro and used vehicle dynamics?Jeremy Adam FletcherZack, thanks for the questions. Good questions. We haven't really quantified what we think the net impact is. As Brad mentioned, it was -- March was a little bit of a mixed bag for us, and different markets performed differently. And for us, it's a fairly tight window to hone in on, especially as we've seen some recovery here in April. As we work through the balance of the remainder of the year, I think for us maybe specifically, we've got some easier comparisons on the DIY side in the first and second quarter just as we think about that look for the rest of the year just because of the -- some of the gas price and other economic pressures that the industry saw in the first half of last year. And then for us, especially as we finish out the fourth quarter on DIY, we saw some really strong results, good end to our year last year. So some of that comparison will impact us. From a broader industry perspective, I think on balance, we'd say we feel like we're at least as close back to normalize as we can probably perceive from all the volatility that we saw through the pandemic. What does that mean for the industry moving forward? I think we'll continue to see the long-term secular impact from just the improved engineering and manufacturing of parts and the impact that, that has on service intervals and the pressure that we've talked about, us and others have talked about for years on that side of our business. But we're kind of cautious around the rest of the outlook. For the industry, we're very positive in terms of how the vehicle dynamics, and Greg and Brent talked about on the call, the vehicle dynamics continue to be strong for our industry. That's a positive for us, and I think that continues to bode well. But obviously, we're, like others, we'll have to wait to see what the broader economy does and what puts and takes that looks like. But I feel good about the overall trajectory for us on the DIY business.Brad W. BeckhamZack, I was just going to say real quick. This is Brad. No matter what the macro does as you know, our teams are always focused on taking DIY share. We still have a tremendous opportunity on the DIY side. We have a lot of great competitors doing a lot of retail business. And so though there's some pressure overall, the outlook is positive on the whole. But I feel even better about our prospects at O'Reilly because of our ability to take market share.Zachary Robert FademPerfect. And appreciate the color. And then on the pro side, do you attribute the outperformance in the industry to better-than-expected industry growth or better-than-expected share gains? And then as your price investments lap, to what extent do you expect to hold the share gains through the year, particularly against the tougher compares?Jeremy Adam FletcherGreat question. We sometimes get a lot smarter in the rearview mirror as to how all the rest of the industry performs. We'll -- I think we'll wait to see some of the data that's out there. We think the industry is strong. I mean, we talked about some of the factors that, I think, contribute to that. And so for sure, we believe that it's a very positive backdrop for us. We are very pleased with our professional business and the gains that we've made. And frankly, we know how hard those gains come. It's a service and relationship business. Loyalty is an important thing. When you have an opportunity to execute well for our customer, it's meaningful. When you fail on the execution, it's even more meaningful. So for us, we view what we've been able to accomplish is very sticky because of really the excellent execution that our teams have been able to deliver as we've had opportunity to -- over the last couple of years.OperatorOur next question is coming from Liz Suzuki with Bank of America.Elizabeth Lane SuzukiCan you just talk about the private label approach you've taken and just how you've been able to grow that portfolio of products so successfully without losing any of your professional customers that tend to be more brand sensitive? And then if you could give any comment about your private label penetration by retail channel versus commercial, that would be helpful, too.Brent G. KirbyYes. Liz, this is Brent. I'll start and then maybe some others can jump in. But I think, again, tribute to our merchandise team and really, just to be clear, too, proprietary brands have grown exponentially over the last several years. We're proud of that, proud of the quality we've been able to put in the box, working with suppliers on those products and really just building good line designs with good, better, best offerings across those lines. And we've seen a lot of strength there. The other thing though I want to reinforce is really, our branding strategy is a mix of quality proprietary brands as well as well-known national brands. And we go to market with both. And we have some national brands that we're very proud of, very proud we have in-house and certainly want to keep in-house because we know customers seek those brands as well. So we really seek a balanced approach. Customers are obviously -- they're looking for value, and they're looking for availability, first and foremost. And we've been able to bring that to our proprietary brand lines. In terms of -- we don't really specifically talk about penetration by DIY and by professional specifically. I will tell you, though, our professional customers use and believe in our proprietary brands, and in many cases, are huge promoters of them because they see the quality and the value in those brands. And Brad can speak to that better than I can. But we see those -- well adoption of those equally well across both DIY and professional customers.Gregory D. JohnsonLiz, this is Greg. Just to add to that, I would say that the shift in the growth of proprietary brands is it's intentional. Proprietary brands give us the ability to leverage multiple suppliers, mitigate risk, help us better control cost of those products and the quality of the products that are in the box. And don't forget that a few of our proprietary brands that we're calling proprietary brands today were national brands a few years ago. So we continue to look for opportunities to take those national brand names that we now own as proprietary brands and spread them across additional categories. So we're very pleased with the performance of our proprietary brands, as Brent said, on both sides of our business.OperatorOur next question is coming from Michael Lasser with UBS.Michael LasserIf we assume that half of your commercial growth in the first quarter came solely from market share gains, which doesn't seem unreasonable given that one of your larger competitors in the commercial space just comped up 3, so you've got maybe 1,000 basis points of share or growth from share gains, that would translate to $150 million of incremental business year-over-year or about $30,000 per store. So is that coming from a big chunky customer who you've been able to win over? And that will give us a sense for as you lap that increase the tails associated with those share gains. And should we also think because you are winning this business and you're probably running your Hot Shot deliveries more, that's where the increase in SG&amp;A is coming from that you're not seeing the flow-through that you might have seen to be as strong as in the past?Brad W. BeckhamMichael, it's Brad. I'll take a stab. A lot of assumptions there, but I probably jump to really your question specifically about kind of where it's coming from and customer type, competitor type. And so I may start out just on the customer front. As you know, with that gap in footprint that we talked about earlier on the call kind of between Washington, D.C. and up to -- through New York City, we still don't have a big book of national or strategic account business. We have a lot of regional-type service providers that are outstanding customers. And we have second, third, fourth call with some of the big national service providers. But really, when we look at our book of business and our -- by customer types, it's coming from a lot of places, but primarily the independent garage. There's obviously some on the national and regional accounts side, but it's not one big move in one area to your question directly. It's a lot of small moves moving from third call to second from second to first. And we're just -- we feel like that is extremely sustainable, and we're really proud of the way we've been able to build that the right way. When you ask about SG&amp;A there, what I would say is there's no doubt, we started the year fully committed to making sure that we had our back counter staffed, our professional parts people making sure that we have efficiencies in the back of the store. That obviously is an investment. It's an investment to keep our small vehicles rolling to the Hot Shot delivery to the shops. As you know well, we talk a lot about getting the car off the rack and making sure that we're safe, we're very efficient in the way that we route deliveries. So we're turning those days and helping these people retain good technicians and all those things. So no doubt, all those things that are investment from an SG&amp;A standpoint. Michael, as you can imagine, when retail gets a little bit softer in a month like March, could our operators have scaled back a little bit from a payroll standpoint? Sure, they could have. But it may or may not have been the right thing to do for the rest of the year in the mid and long term when it comes to our customer service levels. And so part of that was when the business pulled back a little bit there in March is we kept our pedal down to keep those service levels top notch, and we feel like that will pay off for the remainder of the year.Jeremy Adam FletcherOne more thing that I would add there, and maybe back to your specific question. When we think about just generally flow through on the SG&amp;A side, for sure, we're -- we spent a little bit more in the first quarter than we expected, and Brad talked about that. But that was really what we saw on the sales side and what we needed to do to support that. As we think about just more broadly the flow through, that's really more heavily impacted by the investments that we're making this year that we talked about on our last call that we're executing against this year. I think that, in combination with our leadership conference, is more of an impact than just the incremental costs to support our sales, which did drive how we think about the full year, but the bigger year-over-year is what we've been talking about.Michael LasserSo can I clarify that, Jeremy? Is O'Reilly in this era over the last couple of years, last year, but with the price investments this year with more price -- SG&amp;A investments, O'Reilly is in an era where it's making sizable investments to gain share. It's gaining share. But at some point, you'll be able to see better flow-through on those investments, assuming the share continues because the peak of the investment cycle is happening now. And as part of that, why don't you raise the comp guidance? Because it implies a sizable slowdown over the next couple of quarters. So are you not going to see as much share gain over the next couple of quarters?Jeremy Adam FletcherSo Michael, what we would say on the first part of that question, we don't provide guidance beyond the current year. And we will continue to invest in our business over the long term. That's an important part of what we do. But as we've talked about 2023 and the investments we are making and some of these things that we'll see in SG&amp;A and the fact that we have some (inaudible) new leverage because of that, we absolutely don't expect that we would not lever SG&amp;A on strong sales growth as we move forward in the future. That's part of where we're at. There is an opportunity that we see now that we think that has a longer-term payoff for us, and we'll continue to approach that. But we're going to do that whenever we see opportunities to do that. We -- in reference to your sales question, we have some structural things that we've talked about that make comparisons easier in the first half of the year. Certainly, we were pleased with our performance in the first quarter, but we try not to overreact to the first few months of the year knowing we've got a lot of year left. And we'll have to see how the summer selling season plays out.OperatorWe have time for one last question. It's coming from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.Simeon Ari GutmanNice result. I guess will beat the dead horse here, the commercial outperformance. Can you talk about any new accounts versus existing? I don't think there's probably much change there. And then did anything distinctly happen in ticket growth in commercial? And I'll just ask my follow-up now so I don't -- you don't have to hear me again. I wanted to ask you about the import space. We talked a bit about private brands. Can you talk about your strategy there, which is OE like with Import Direct? Are you able to penetrate that market fully with that product line or any aspiration to do it with the OE lines?Brad W. BeckhamYes. Simeon, it's Brad. I'll take the first part of your question. I may kick it over to Brent for the latter part. On customer segments, I talked a little bit a minute ago just about not necessarily anything materially changed on the national or the strategic account side. We continue to feel like we're earning the business every day with some of the regional-type service providers. But just on the -- really the core of our business, which is the independent garage, we're seeing a little bit of both. We're seeing new customers. We're seeing existing customers move forward. We were mature enough in most all our markets where there isn't just flat out brand new customers that we weren't on the call list somewhere. It's just a matter of moving from fourth to third, third to second and second to first, like we talk about all the time. So combination, but it would be more so just continuing to take more share, delivery vehicle that had a total job versus in the past, we may have been -- us and a competitor delivering a split job. We see a lot of opportunity with getting those full jobs, and we feel like that's happening.Brent G. KirbyYes. And Simeon, this is Brent. On the second half of your question regarding Import Direct, we continue to be very pleased with the performance of Import Direct and our offering there. And we continue to enhance the coverage of it, and we continue to see customers continue to penetrate that brand. So very happy there and feel like we compete well.Gregory D. JohnsonAnd we are intending in some categories with the branded international type products as well, as well as some of those well-known branded suppliers are in our Import Direct boxes in some cases as well.Brent G. KirbyThat's right.OperatorWe have reached our allotted time for questions. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Greg Johnson for closing remarks.Gregory D. JohnsonThank you, Ali. We'd like to conclude our call today by thanking the entire O'Reilly team for your continued hard work in the first quarter. I'd like to thank everyone for joining our call today, and we look forward to reporting our second quarter results in July. Thank you.OperatorThank you. This does conclude today's call. You may disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation.]"

These risks and uncertainties include, without limitation: adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect the company’s ability to meet liquidity needs, access to capital and cost of capital; conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally; volatility or declines in the equity, bond or real estate markets; changes in interest rates or credit spreads or a prolonged low interest rate environment; the elimination of the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (""LIBOR""); the company’s investment portfolio is subject to several risks that may diminish the value of its invested assets and the investment returns credited to customers; the company’s valuation of investments and the determination of the amount of allowances and impairments taken on such investments may include methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations; any impairments of or valuation allowances against the company’s deferred tax assets; the company’s actual experience for insurance and annuity products could differ significantly from its pricing and reserving assumptions; the pattern of amortizing the company’s DAC asset and other actuarial balances may change; changes in laws, regulations or accounting standards; the company’s ability to pay stockholder dividends, make share repurchases and meet its obligations may be constrained by the limitations on dividends or other distributions Iowa insurance laws impose on Principal Life; litigation and regulatory investigations; from time to time the company may become subject to tax audits, tax litigation or similar proceedings, and as a result it may owe additional taxes, interest and penalties in amounts that may be material; applicable laws and the company’s certificate of incorporation and by-laws may discourage takeovers and business combinations that some stockholders might consider in their best interests; competition, including from companies that may have greater financial resources, broader arrays of products, higher ratings and stronger financial performance; a downgrade in the company’s financial strength or credit ratings; client terminations, withdrawals or changes in investor preferences; the company’s hedging or risk management strategies prove ineffective or insufficient; international business risks; risks arising from participation in joint ventures; the company may need to fund deficiencies in its ""Closed Block"" assets; the company’s reinsurers could default on their obligations or increase their rates; risks arising from acquisitions of businesses; risks related to administering reinsurance transactions; a pandemic, terrorist attack, military action or other catastrophic event; global climate change; technological and societal changes may disrupt the company’s business model and impair its ability to retain existing customers, attract new customers and maintain its profitability; damage to the company’s reputation; the company may not be able to protect its intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims; inability to attract, develop and retain qualified employees and sales representatives and develop new distribution sources; an interruption in information technology, infrastructure or other internal or external systems used for business operations, or a failure to maintain the confidentiality, integrity or availability of data residing on such systems; loss of key vendor relationships or failure of a vendor to protect information of our customers or employees; and the company’s enterprise risk management framework may not be fully effective in identifying or mitigating all of the risks to which the company is exposed.Use of Non-GAAP financial measuresThe company uses a number of non-GAAP financial measures that management believes are useful to investors because they illustrate the performance of normal, ongoing operations, which is important in understanding and evaluating the company’s financial condition and results of operations. They are not, however, a substitute for U.S. GAAP financial measures. Therefore, the company has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure at the end of the release. The company adjusts U.S. GAAP measures for items not directly related to ongoing operations. However, it is possible these adjusting items have occurred in the past and could recur in future reporting periods. Management also uses non-GAAP measures for goal setting, as a basis for determining employee and senior management awards and compensation and evaluating performance on a basis comparable to that used by investors and securities analysts.Earnings conference callOn Friday, Apr. 28, 2023, at 10:00 a.m. (ET), Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Dan Houston and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Deanna Strable will lead a discussion of results and the impacts on future prospects, asset quality and capital adequacy during a live conference call, which can be accessed as follows:Via live Internet webcast.

The company has determined this measure is more representative of underlying operating revenues growth for PGI as it removes commissions and other expenses that are collected through fee revenue and passed through expenses with no impact to pre-tax operating earnings.8 Operating margin for PGI = pre-tax operating earnings, adjusted for noncontrolling interest divided by operating revenues less pass-through expenses.9 Combined net revenue (a non-GAAP financial measure): net revenue for all PI companies at 100% less pass-through commissions. The company has determined combined net revenue (at PFG share) is more representative of underlying net revenue growth for PI as it reflects our proportionate share of consolidated and equity method subsidiaries.

589,2c118a50-adba-3736-80fc-7729ee88db15,PFG,2023-04-28,2022 Sustainability Report: What It Means and Why It Matters,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2022-sustainability-report-means-why-131000639.html,1682601000,STORY,['PFG'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / April 27, 2023 / Principal Financial Group:Originally published on principal.comFor some, being sustainable equals individual actions to benefit the environment-recycling, for example.But when companies talk about sustainability, they're referring to the choices and plans they make to support people, the planet, and their business now and into the future. Sometimes it's referred to as environmental, social, and governance, or ESG. That's an acknowledgement that sustainability is inclusive of, but much more than, behaviors like recycling.The Principal Financial Group® purpose is clear: To foster a world where financial security is accessible to all. But that world remains far from reach if employees aren't empowered, everyone doesn't feel financially included, and business activities aren't sustainable for the future.At Principal®, our 2022 Sustainability Report details the progress-and the potential future global impact-of our enterprise approach to sustainability. It's an opportunity to measure and check in: Are strategies working? Do goals need to change? Are we driving positive, long-term outcomes?Some of the achievements in the report highlight progress such as expanding our energy and greenhouse gas emissions data collection from a U.S.-only to a worldwide scope, which in turn helps us plan how to reduce those emissions over the next few decades. Others offer examples of our more expansive approach to sustainability such as supporting a diverse workforce.In the words of our President and CEO Dan Houston: ""We're prepared to keep the momentum going in 2023, advancing inclusive products and services, embedding sustainable practices, and harnessing the power of our people. We know there is more we can do. We're committed to the work and transparency required to do it effectively.""Principal and peopleHow does sustainability relate to people-both our employees and customers? The Sustainability Report offers insights into both short- and long-term opportunities that help each group.Story continuesFor employees and work, it's a gauge of their supportive work environment and their perception of it, among other measurements. A few key points:Measuring inclusion. We've implemented assessments of our employee inclusion efforts and the culture of work at Principal, including attributes such as authenticity, learning new things, sharing perspectives, and feeling valued and respected. The Principal goal is a score of 80% or above annually; we exceeded that goal in 2022 with 82%.Embracing diversity. Supporting diverse employees and leaders who are able to bring their authentic selves to work remains foundational to Principal. Currently, 46% of all management positions globally are held by women and 54% of our global workforce are women. In the U.S., the percentage of employees who identified as people of color increased in all employment categories from 2021 to 2022.Ensuring equality. The Principal Sustainability Report also takes note of outside honors and awards as third-party insight into our progress. In 2022, Principal was named to the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index for the eighth time, and recognized by the 2022 Disability Equality Index.Principal and the planetWhile much of the Principal Sustainability Report focuses on current achievements, it also addresses multi-year goals and aspirations, particularly when it comes to the climate. After all, financial security cannot be accessible to all if climate change fosters instability. To that end, several notable metrics help Principal gauge progress.Cutting global emissions. Principal updated emissions reduction goals to a 65% reduction in scope 1 and 2 market-based emissions by 2034.Reducing waste. Principal has set the ongoing goal of meeting or exceeding Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) guidelines for waste and recycling and has diverted 69% of waste through a combination of recycling, donating, and composting.Increasing renewable energy use. Nearly 50% of global energy consumption came from renewable sources worldwide, and 58% of total U.S. energy consumption in 2022 came from renewable sources. In addition, Principal reduced its overall U.S. energy consumption from 2021 to 2022 by 1.4%Principal and profitsDriving meaningful change includes actions big and small for Principal core business and other efforts. The Sustainability Report demonstrates how to track those outcomes and data points, bring attention to partners, and continue to make progress-even if progress isn't linear.Assessing the globe. In 2022, Principal, in collaboration with the Centre for Economics and Business Research, released results from its launch of the Global Financial Inclusion Index. A measurement of 42 global markets with personal and business perspectives, the index helps create an understanding of the actions necessary to help improve financial security for all.Maintaining an ethical culture. Acting ethically and with integrity are central to the Principal core values. For the 12th time, Principal was recognized for its ethical leadership and business practices as a 2023 World's Most Ethical Companies® honoree by Ethisphere.1Monitoring suppliers. In 2022, Principal updated the Global Supplier Code of Conduct with more robust expectations and guidelines on a variety of factors, including environmental, social, and governance performance.Read the full 2022 Principal Sustainability Report.Global Financial Inclusion Index is a proprietary model output based upon certain assumptions that may change, are not guaranteed and should not be relied upon as a significant basis for an investment decision.Integration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors is qualitative and subjective by nature.

Today I will analyse the most recent data on Sherwin-Williams’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams What's The Opportunity In Sherwin-Williams?According to my valuation model, Sherwin-Williams seems to be fairly priced at around 16.06% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Sherwin-Williams today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $200.50, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Sherwin-Williams’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from Sherwin-Williams?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares.

As a reminder, this call is being recorded and is also being webcast within the accompanying slide presentation through the company's Investor Relations website. The audio webcast archive will be available for 1 year on American Water's Investor Relations website. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Aaron Musgrave, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Musgrave, you may begin.Aaron MusgraveThank you, Betsy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's call. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. Let me first go over some safe harbor language. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements that represent our expectations regarding our future performance or other future events. These statements are predictions based on our current expectations, estimates and assumptions. However, since these statements deal with future events, they are subject to numerous known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results indicated or implied by such statements. Additional information regarding these risks, uncertainties and factors as well as a more detailed analysis of our financials and other important information is provided in the first quarter earnings release and in our March 31 Form 10-Q, each filed yesterday with the SEC. And finally, all statements during this presentation related to earnings and earnings per share refer to diluted earnings and diluted earnings per share. Susan Hardwick, our President and CEO, will share highlights of results, 2023 EPS guidance and longer-term targets and the proposed PFAS rule recently announced by the U.S. EPA. John Griffith, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will cover our first quarter financial results in more detail, discuss our successful equity issuance. And we'll close with an update on sizable acquisitions announced so far this year. Cheryl Norton, our Executive Vice President and COO, will then discuss our capital investment plan and active general rate cases and conclude with a few regulatory updates, including details of the EPA's proposed PFAS rule. We'll then close by answering your questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to American Water's President and CEO, Susan Hardwick.Story continuesM. Susan HardwickThanks, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. As we announced yesterday, we're off to a good start in 2023 with strong financial results. As shown on Slide 5, earnings were $0.91 per share for the quarter compared to $0.87 per share last year. The increased results were as expected and put us on track to achieve our full year earnings guidance, which we're pleased to affirm. . Here, you can also see a recap of some of our other key accomplishments so far in 2023. And John and Cheryl will add to these in their remarks. As we announced in March, we completed a very successful upsized equity issuance of $1.7 billion of American Water common stock. This delivered on the highest priority in our 2023 financing plan. We also invested well over $500 million of capital in infrastructure in the quarter. In addition, we secured 2 large acquisitions so far this year, which puts us at over $550 million of acquisitions under agreement. We did all of this while keeping customer bills affordable and staying true to our high value of quality service. The other significant news in the first quarter for us in the water industry as a whole came from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency when they released proposed national standards for PFAS. We support the EPA's efforts to protect drinking water quality. These contaminants are among the multiple challenges in the water industry faces regarding water quality, quantity and reliability. We remain steadfast in our commitment to be a leader in the U.S. water and wastewater industry and a provider of solutions to these challenges. Providing safe, clean, reliable and affordable water and wastewater service to customers has been American Water's mission for over 130 years. We will continue to work cooperatively with the EPA and with Congress, regulators and policymakers in support of water quality standards that protect customers and communities, balanced with affordability. Cheryl will elaborate further on the PFAS proposal and our response to it, but I want to assure our customers, regulators, investors and other stakeholders that American Water has the expertise and the will to tackle this issue head on and to advocate for reasonable policies and outcomes related to this very important topic. Turning to Slide 6. As I mentioned, we are affirming our 2023 EPS guidance range of $4.72 to $4.82 per share as well as our long-term targets. We believe our strong regulatory and operational execution is a positive differentiator from our peers. As we've done in the past, we expect to consistently deliver on our annual and long-term plan, growing earnings and dividends at a top-tier pace over the next 5 years and beyond. Moving on to Slide 7. As we announced yesterday, our Board of Directors increased the company's quarterly cash dividend from $0.655 per share to 0.7075 per share, an 8% increase. We have grown our dividend at a compounded annual growth rate of 9.7% over the last 5 years, significantly outpacing most of our utility peers. Looking ahead, we continue to expect to grow our dividend at 7% to 9% per year on average, which is in line with our compelling 7% to 9% EPS growth target. Our Board and management team understand and appreciate how important the dividend component of our total shareholder return is to many of our investors. And with that, let me turn it over to John to cover some first quarter highlights and financial results in more detail. John?John C. GriffithThank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 9. I'll start by reviewing the equity issuance completed in March really the first primary offering of meaningful size for American Water since 2009. As we've said, our plan was to issue in 2023, a significant portion of the $2 billion of expected equity needed in our current 5-year plan that goes through 2027. We were pleased to see very strong demand for the offering, which was upsized and the [Greenshoe] fully exercised for proceeds of $1.7 billion. The remaining portion of the $2 billion of our currently planned equity expected to be issued near the end of this 5-year plan. We used the proceeds to bring our commercial paper balance down to 0 by quarter end, with a modest amount of cash left over. With the equity issuance, our balance sheet is fortified to fund our robust water and wastewater investment well into the future. Our total debt-to-capital ratio, which at year-end was just above our target of 60% or less, has decreased meaningfully to 54% as of quarter end. With our growth plan, this metric will rise somewhat over the next few years until we reset again as we receive in late 2026 the no proceeds from our sale of HOS and issue the remaining equity that is in our current 5-year plan. So to wrap up on equity, we believe the execution of this issuance is another indicator that the American Water investment thesis is strong, led by our compelling growth story and the leadership role we play in the utility sector. I'd like to take a moment to thank our treasury, legal, IR and many other teams at American Water as well as our external advisers who worked diligently to prepare us to be ready to execute this transaction early in the year when the window of opportunity emerged. Turning our attention to Slide 10. I'll provide some further insights into our financial results for the quarter. Earnings were $0.91 per share for the quarter, up $0.04 per share versus the same period in 2022. As you know, we have completed rate cases recently in our larger states and are seeing the increased revenues as a result. These additional revenues are driven by the significant investments we are making in our infrastructure, including the acceleration of spend made possible by the proceeds from the sales of New York American Water and Homeowner Services. As we've said consistently since the sales, it takes time to reinvest the sales proceeds, and we are beginning to see those impacts. And looking at operating costs, higher pension expense of about $0.03 per share and inflationary pressure on chemical, fuel and power costs of about $0.04 per share were largely mitigated by the higher revenues. Our proactive strategy last year to seek rate case recovery in many of our large jurisdictions of rising production costs and expected higher pension costs has positioned us favorably to limit the bottom line impact of those higher costs in 2023. As with the rate case we just filed in Indiana, we will be looking to recover higher operating costs in other jurisdictions over the next year through earning a full return -- though earning a full return on rate base investments and acquisitions continues to be the key driver of our general rate cases. Next, depreciation increased $0.06 per share and interest on additional long-term debt increased $0.04 per share due to the $800 million senior note issuance from last May, both supporting our investment growth. Interest expense in the quarter also reflected about $0.04 per share from higher short-term interest rates. I would also note that the EPS impact of the higher share count from our equity issuance was essentially neutral to EPS when considering the avoided interest cost in the first quarter by paying off commercial paper. We expect dilution from the higher share count net of avoided interest expense to be approximately neutral to EPS for the full year as well. Finally, other net consists primarily of favorable post-close adjustments recorded in the first quarter of 2022 from the sale of HOS and additional earnings in 2023 from our new Military Services Group contract with Naval Station Mayport in Florida that we were awarded last summer. Turning to Slide 11. You'll see that we are set up for strong growth through acquisitions in 2023 and beyond. We had 27 transactions under agreement across 9 states through the end of March, including the Butler Area Sewer Authority, Wastewater System in Pennsylvania, we previously announced as well as the Towamencin Township Wastewater System in Pennsylvania, we are purchasing for $104 million as announced in March as part of an agreement to assume that asset purchase agreement from NextEra.Then just a few weeks ago, we were pleased to announce the purchase of the wastewater treatment plant in Granite City, Illinois for $83 million, which puts us at over $550 million of acquisitions under contract. We hope to close on Granite City by the end of 2023 and expect to close on Towamencin by midyear 2024, both pending regulatory approval, and we look forward to serving those customers. Of course, as we close on transactions, the work to build and refill the acquisition pipeline is continuous across our footprint. Our pipeline of over 1.3 million customer connections is a strong leading indicator that supports this piece of our earnings growth triangle. Before I turn it over to Cheryl, I'll echo Susan's comment that we're off to a very good start to the year. I'm confident in our ability to achieve our 2023 EPS guidance of $4.72 to $4.82 per share. Looking ahead, I am pleased that we have the right fundamentals in place including our newly strengthened balance sheet to achieve our long-term financial targets, which we are also affirming today. With that, I'll turn it over to Cheryl to talk more about our capital investment, rate case and other regulatory updates. Cheryl?Cheryl D. NortonThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Slide 13 shows that our state and corporate leaders and their teams did a great job in the first quarter, executing on our increased capital plan. It required significant effort to safely and efficiently deliver the dozens of projects that improved our systems and drove capital investment higher by nearly $100 million in the quarter compared to the same period last year.This result keeps us on pace to hit our goal of approximately $2.9 billion of capital investment spending in 2023. To show the magnitude of our regulatory execution efforts and timely recovery of these investments, you can see on Slide 14 that we already have $279 million in annualized new revenues in rates since January of 2023. This includes $229 million from general rate cases and step increases and $50 million from infrastructure surcharges. We also have $144 million of total annualized revenue request pending, including 2 infrastructure surcharge proceedings. Moving on to our regulatory strategy on Slide 15. Our theme here is around timely, consistent recovery of investments and operating costs. We have consistently engaged with policymakers and regulators to find the best ways to invest in water and wastewater infrastructure and achieve timely recovery. When we achieve timely and consistent recovery, it levels out bill increases to our customers, making those bills more manageable. The pie chart on the right side of the page also speaks to timely recovery of our investments across our footprint. Through capital recovery mechanisms and forward test years, we can reduce regulatory lag and lessen the reliance on general rate cases. This enables us not only to earn our lab return but also to mitigate the size of general rate increases for our customers. We expect about 75% of capital investments over the next 5 years to be recoverable through infrastructure mechanisms and through the use of forward test years, which is the key to unlocking a more consistent annual earnings growth pattern for the long term. The ability to execute our regulatory strategies is a critical success factor for continuing to grow our business each year. As water and wastewater industry challenges grow, we'll continue to focus on constructive, regulatory and legislative outcomes to help us work through those challenges. Let's go to Slide 16 and cover the latest regulatory activity in our states. Shown on the slide is a summary of our pending general rate cases with some key facts for each. In the appendix, you'll also find some details related to infrastructure charges as well as a snapshot of the key outcomes from the most recent general rate cases in our top 10 states. At the end of March, we filed a general rate case in Indiana, reflecting $875 million in water and wastewater system investments to be made through 2025 to continue providing safe and reliable service. The revenue request also includes an increase in the cost of chemicals and other operating costs that we continue to see. We are seeking to increase revenues over a phased 3-step process through May 2025 that would result in $87 million of additional annual revenue when fully implemented. In California, our case was filed in July of last year and is progressing as expected so far. We're seeking increased revenues of approximately $95 million over a phased 3-step process with rate changes expected to be effective in 2024, 2025 and 2026. We're also still awaiting a ruling from the commission on the pending cost of capital case. In Missouri, on March 3, we were pleased to file a settlement agreement with the Missouri Public Service Commission. The settlement reflects an increase of $95 million in annualized revenues, including $51 million for previously approved infrastructure surcharges. A final decision on this matter is expected in the second quarter of 2023. And finally, earlier this week, the Virginia State Corporation Commission approved the settlement of our rate request, authorizing a total annualized revenue increase of approximately $11 million. Outside of general rate cases, there were a few notable developments since our fourth quarter 2022 call. In California, related to the Monterey Water Supply Project we signed the Pure Water Monterey Expansion agreement following an order issued by the CPUC. We are now allowed to standard ratemaking treatment for the construction funding of the pumps and pipes that were built to support the expansion. Together with the desalination and water reuse projects in process and Aqua for storage and recovery online, we believe that a secure water future for the Monterey Peninsula is now possible once the approval process is complete. On the legislative front, in Indiana, Senate Bill 180 passed the State House and Senate with bipartisan support and is awaiting the Governor's signature where it will become effective immediately. This bill allows for consolidated rates in wastewater systems through Indiana's Service Enhancement Improvement Recovery Mechanism. Turning to PFAS, I'll expand on Susan's earlier comments on EPA's proposed rule making. While American Water has long been anticipating and preparing for the rule making, our initial analyses were primarily based on a federal PFAS standard that would be more in line with the higher treatment limits set by several states. We are carefully reviewing the EPA's proposed drinking water regulation to assess the 4 parts per trillion limits for PFOA and PFOS and the application of the hazard index approach for several other chemicals. Our review will assess impacts to our capital and operating expense plan as well as our needed financing. It's logical to assume that the significantly lower treatment level, the numbers -- the number of facilities that will require treatment will be larger as will the cost. One of our early concerns is that EPA's cost estimates are materially understated. Our analysis continues and upon completion of our preliminary assessment, we'll submit comments on the proposal to the EPA by May 30. As the EPA develops its final rule, which is expected by the end of 2023, we'll have more information to share based upon further review and analysis. To be very clear though, American Water joins other water organizations in support of the EPA, Congress and other decision-makers in implementing reasonable policies aimed at keeping harmful PFAS out of drinking water supplies and communities. In addition to the comments we intend to provide on the proposed rule itself. We also expect to provide comments to the EPA and others on many related issues, including the following: We'll ask for an exemption of water and wastewater systems from financial liability for PFAS under [circa]. We'll also ask to ensure all water and wastewater utility providers regardless of ownership, have equal access to any and all federal and/or state funding related to treating PFAS. In addition, we'll request permanent federal funding for a water and wastewater low-income customer assistance program. Providing safe, reliable and affordable water is American Water's business. We'll continue to work productively with the EPA, Congress, regulators and policymakers to ensure that the implementation of any final standards protects customers, communities and the general public. So with that, I'll turn it back over to our operator to begin Q&amp;A and take any questions you might have.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) The first question today comes from Richard Sunderland with JPMorgan.Richard Wallace SunderlandAppreciate all the commentary on the PFAS side, but just wanted to dig in there a little bit more. Any way to frame the magnitude of capital versus O&amp;M that's particularly levered to an outcome here at a minimum? Is this more of a capital opportunity than an expense concern? Or are you kind of flagging both as potential impacts to rates on a go-forward basis?M. Susan HardwickYes, it's a great question. Obviously, as Cheryl indicated, we have a lot of analysis to do with this proposed rule at these treatment limits that are proposed. And you know Rich, how this works. I mean there's a process to be worked here in terms of comments and feedback to the EPA about the proposed rule. And as Cheryl said, obviously, we're quite supportive of what they're trying to accomplish here. And in fact, even at the 4 parts per trillion, we don't have a huge issue with that. I think the issue is around cost. As Cheryl said, our early expectations here are that the EPA estimates around costs are understated. So I think that will be part of the response that the industry generally provides back to the EPA. For us, as I said and Cheryl said we are continuing to evaluate the impact. And as you know, we've talked about this many times. We use a risk-based approach to our capital planning. So as we work on these projects into our capital plan, it could very well change that risk profile and move other projects out. So as we think about changes to our overall plan, we still got a lot of work to determine that. Specific to your question, though, around capital versus O&amp;M, we think there's a fair amount of both that will be necessary at this level. So there'll be capital requirements to have facilities that are able to facilitate the treatment. And then, of course, there'll be an ongoing operating costs associated with the treatment itself. So lots to be learned yet on this and again, direct impacts to our plan yet to be determined.Richard Wallace SunderlandOkay. Understood. That's very helpful context. I guess sticking with the cost side, we spent a lot of time last year discussing chemicals costs, and it came up in the walk this year in terms of the rate recovery of those higher costs. Can you speak a little bit more to the recent trends you're seeing there and maybe bridge that back to your expectations last fall when you laid out the latest plan? How do you think about these expenses impacting customer bills over the next few years?M. Susan HardwickYes, Rich, good question. Cheryl and John certainly can weigh in on this, too. But we have seen, I'd say, a continuation of the impacts that we started seeing really in the second quarter of last year. While some of the increases in certain costs may have started to level out a bit. They still are all elevated, and we expect that to continue for some time. I think the real key here, and you touched on it, is the work we did in the regulatory arena to address these costs early on. And we've estimated that roughly 75% of the costs we'll experience in '23, we've got fully baked into rates as a result of those cases we did last year. And as Cheryl mentioned or maybe John did, in the prepared remarks, in the Indiana case we just filed, we've addressed it there, too. So we think we have done as a good job as could be done to address these costs early on so that they don't have bottom line impact. But we continue to see a fair amount of pressure here on the cost side.OperatorThe next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Seaport.Agnieszka Anna StorozynskiSo maybe like the presentation question. So you no longer show us the breakdown of earnings by segment, right, with no bridge for regulated earnings, market based and corporate. Can you give us the breakdown for the quarter?M. Susan HardwickWell, I think the waterfall that you have there probably is as good as there is. The impact from the market-based business, which is now just military is very small. And on a year-over-year basis, just not much of a variation. The other segment, I think we highlighted the primary driver there, which would have been the gain, the sort of true-up gain on the HOS sale in the first quarter of last year.Agnieszka Anna StorozynskiOkay. So I mean, I tried to actually imply it from the 10-Q, and I couldn't. But anyway, okay. Moving on to -- you did mention the weather as a factor in earnings. And that's, I think, something that we've seen on the electric side and a couple of water peers have also highlighted as a drag on the quarter. Was that a driver at all?M. Susan HardwickYes. First quarter for us is not much of a weather impact here. Cheryl, do you want to just talk about seasonality or...Cheryl D. NortonYes. Our biggest weather impacts are going to be in second and third quarter. Sometimes it will spill over into the fourth quarter. Typically, the first quarter unless the weather is really, really severe in one direction or another. We won't see any weather impact at all. And this year, I think the weather was not that dramatic for us to see that impact. So I think we're pretty solid.Agnieszka Anna StorozynskiOkay. And then lastly, I noticed that you are pursuing an appeal of that denial of the acquisition adjustment related to the Shorelands acquisition. It looks like a decision will be issued sometime in 2023. So can you -- again, I haven't followed it closely, but can you give us a sense of -- is this still a long shot? I mean how important is it for any future growth aspirations you might have? And I know that, that transaction itself is only $29 million. So that's not that big a deal as far as the goodwill impact. But again, any implications related to this pending case?M. Susan HardwickYes. Really, no implications of any materiality. But Cheryl, do you want to comment on status here?Cheryl D. NortonYes. Angie. The issue is still kind of hanging out there, but there's going to be no real impact to us from a financial perspective. And in all honesty, we found other ways of doing deals so that we're not so worried about the precedents that this decision sets for us. We still believe like we have a strong case, but in the grand scheme of things, it really has little to no impact.Agnieszka Anna StorozynskiOkay. And then just going back to PFAS, I'm sorry. So I looked at these rules, I mean, pretty strict requirements with penalties. Then again, I think the problem we've seen over the last couple of decades is that it hasn't been really imposing those penalties or really going after the systems that have been noncompliant with the regulations. So I'm just wondering if -- how big a difference would there be with this one as far as, for example, your municipal growth -- municipal M&amp;A or any sort of additional pressure that should exert on privately or meaningfully owned systems, again, because EPA hasn't been particularly diligent in imposing other rules.M. Susan HardwickYes, I think it's a fair observation, Angie. It's obviously one of the things that we'll address in our comments. We think that these rules should apply, obviously, to all providers and that EPA should use its authority to enforce the rules. There is a track record here. So we'll have to, again, sort of comment on that. As it relates to our views on acquisition potential. John, do you want to comment on that? We think there could be some opportunity, but I think you've hit on the key issue.John C. GriffithYes. Angie, I'd just say that we look at this issue as another reason on the list for why municipals may choose to sell to us in the future.OperatorThe next question comes from Paul Zimbardo with Bank of America.Paul Andrew ZimbardoCongrats on the successful equity offering. Just curious, did you consider placing the full $2 billion of equity for the full plan to just take it out of the way given the strong demand? And I believe I heard you say that you expect the equity offering to be EPS neutral on full year 2023 versus plan. Was that correct?M. Susan HardwickJohn, do you want to comment here?John C. GriffithSure. On the first part of the question, we tried to remain consistent with the messaging that we had provided to investors in the past. So as we thought about the magnitude of the issuance, we wanted to stay within that range, and we did so. With regards to dilution, that's correct, we expect that just given our ability to pay off debt and with where interest rates are and given how we trade from a valuation perspective, we look at the issuance as -- is EPS neutral.Paul Andrew ZimbardoOkay. Great. And then switching topics. I noticed that Indiana legislation is well. Does that influence higher any of the prospective capital or acquisition priorities in the state?M. Susan HardwickJohn, do you want to comment on that? This is -- yes, the question really, Paul, is around this consolidated rate issue, that legislation you're referring to.Paul Andrew ZimbardoAnd the additional mechanism from the new legislation that was enacted, it seems like it could help produce regulatory lag prospectively.M. Susan HardwickYes, I think that's probably fair. And I do think it probably creates opportunity around acquisitions. Again, I think it gives us more leverage to grow in Indiana and have used that consolidated revenue mechanism to lessen the bill impact on customers. I think it's a very important piece of legislation from that perspective to, again, sort of facilitate growth.OperatorNext question comes from Gregg Orrill with UBS.Gregg Gillander OrrillCongratulations. I was wondering if I could ask your view on sort of Florida as a market for acquisitions. I think there's legislation that's progressing there on fair value. And then just how you're thinking about the pursuit of litigation regarding the PFAS rules to help pay and sort of the -- how that would get folded in versus the time line for compliance?M. Susan HardwickWell, those are 2 big topics, Gregg. First, maybe on Florida, let me just comment there. I think -- and obviously, we're following developments there as we do sort of across the nation around legislative actions, regulatory actions, et cetera. But I'd say our answer is the same as it always is on potential growth into other states. We really have to see an opportunity to grow substantially in a particular state. We look at regulatory environment, legislative environment, those types of things. And we're constantly looking at opportunities. But all of the parts have to sort of come together. I think for us to do anything significant beyond our existing footprint, which, of course, we like a lot. We think we have optimized our footprint. We like the environments that we're in. We have great opportunities for growth in our existing jurisdictions. And obviously, that's where our focus continues to be. On your second question around PFAS and litigation and impacts there. As Cheryl mentioned, there is litigation and has been for some time around this. And our goal here, I think the industry's goal is to -- well, we feel responsible for helping to solve the problem, and we are best positioned to do the treatment. We do think it's important that those that are responsible for the production of the chemicals also be held responsible. So we are -- our states are actively involved in that litigation and will continue to be. And we do think that's an important part of this overall equation that has to be worked through. And again, customer affordability is at the heart of that. We don't think it's necessary or appropriate for customers to pay for things that they really aren't responsible for. So we'll be actively pursuing that litigation along with -- the rest of the industry.Operator(Operator Instructions) The next question comes from Jonathan Reeder with Wells Fargo.Jonathan Garrett ReederI just wanted to build a little bit on Angie's earlier question just regarding kind of the segment breakdown a little bit. Can you give us some directional guidance. I don't think your full year was exactly broken out by the 2 segments and was kind of other being recast to include what's left to market based and the other historical parent and other segment. I think full year 2022 was $0.19 from that segment, but that included I think it was a $19 million pretax gain. So how should we be thinking about, I guess, full year '23 kind of overall drag there?M. Susan HardwickJonathan, we're going to have to go back and look at those numbers. Those numbers don't sound right to me for the prior year. We had some true-up activity related to the HOS sale and maybe that's getting confused a bit here. But all that's remaining is our Military Services Group. And the earnings year-over-year are really not much of a variance and it's a relatively small part of the overall earnings contribution anyway.But we can follow back up on that reconciliation, the numbers that you're quoting because, again, I don't think that's reflective of the size of the business.Jonathan Garrett ReederOkay. So -- but I mean, it sounds like if we just strip out maybe that $19 million pretax true-up gain or whatever that you're kind of thinking. The other part of the business is kind of flattish when we look at it from '22 to '23.M. Susan HardwickYes. Certainly, the Military Services Group operations year-over-year relatively flat. We'll need to verify that $19 million pretax number you're quoting there. That doesn't ring a bell to me. I mean I know there's a number there. I just don't recall it being that. So we'll just -- we'll have Aaron follow back up with you on that just to make sure we got the right numbers there.OperatorThis concludes our question-and-answer session and concludes the conference call.

That’s a serious issue, and it should prompt investors to start getting creative in portfolio allocation. One idea is to take advantage of growth-oriented sectors – and to start thinking globally for where to find them.Banking giant Goldman Sachs has done much of the footwork, and the firm’s chief US equity strategist David Kostin has pointed out that China’s pullback from the zero-COVID lockdown policies is likely to ignite a commodities boom. With pundits from the International Monetary Fund and Bloomberg adding their voices – estimating that China will contribute more than 22% of total global economic growth this year – Kostin notes that the metal and mining sectors are best positioned to gain heavily from Chinese demand.“Metals &amp; Mining stocks stand to benefit from continued China economic growth. China accounts for about half of global demand for industrial metals such as aluminum and copper… US mining companies are not heavily reliant on China as an export market but stand to benefit indirectly from China demand through higher global metals prices,” Kostin explained.Stock analyst Emily Chieng, one of Goldman’s mining industry experts, is running with Kostin’s lead, and picking out metal stocks that stand to gain in a commodities boom. Using TipRanks, the world’s biggest database of analysts and research, we’ve pulled up the details on three of these stock picks, which are offering up to 60% upside potential.Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF)We’ll start with Cleveland-Cliffs, a major producer of flat-rolled steel in the US market, with a diversified portfolio of finished steel products. This company got its start in the mining business, and still operates iron mines in upper Michigan and northern Minnesota, that feed the firm’s steelmaking, metal stamping, tooling production, and tubular component production. In addition to its leading position in the flat-rolled steel segment, Cleveland-Cliffs is also a leader in the production of automotive-grade steel products.Story continuesCleveland-Cliffs benefits greatly from its position as a producer of iron ore, and in addition, the company also mines coking coal, with a mining facility in West Virginia and coking facilities, which turn the raw coal into a vital ingredient for steel-making, in West Virginia, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. The company’s steel and steel products have applications in manufacturing and packaging, as well as the appliance, auto, equipment, construction, and energy industries.While revenues and earnings have decreased in recent quarters, they have still managed to exceed expectations. In the most recent release, for 1Q23, the company had a top line of $5.3 billion, down 11% from the year-ago period – but the Q1 result beat analyst expectations by $90 million. The bottom line non-GAAP EPS of 11 cents was a far cry from the $1.50 reported in 1Q22, but was a penny better than the forecast.The company reported total steel sales of 4.1 million tons in Q1, for a year-over-year increase of 14%. The increase in volume sold partially offset a reduction in average net selling price.In a development that bodes well for the company’s balance sheet, the firm reported $1.65 billion in borrowings under its credit facilities during Q1, and made $1.34 billion in payments against that debt. Cleveland-Cliffs has stated a commitment to paying down short-term revolver debt, and to that end, on April 14, the company announced closure on an offering of unsecured guaranteed notes, to the total of $750 million and due in 2030, at 6.75% annually. Net proceeds from this offering will be used to repay revolver credit borrowings.That forms the background for the comments by Goldman Sachs’ Emily Chieng, who says of this company: “We believe fixed-price contract renegotiation at higher levels and line of sight on sequential cost reduction will drive margin improvement for CLF this year versus second half of last year, particularly as natural gas prices sit below our forecasts. Further, we expect volume growth of ~8% versus prior year to be driven by automotive end markets on improving supply chain efficiencies, low dealer inventories, and healthy consumer backlogs. While CLF has made progress on improving its balance sheet last year, we continue to expect a focus on deleveraging and remain focused on share buybacks.”Chieng complements her comments with a Buy rating on CLF shares, and a $24 price target that implies a one-year gain of ~60%. (To watch Chieng’s track record, click here)Overall, there are 5 recent analyst reviews on record for this stock, and they include 2 Buys and 3 Holds – for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The stock is priced at $15 and its $22 average price target implies ~47% upside on the one-year horizon. (See CLF stock forecast)Freeport-McMoRan (FCX)Now we’ll take a look at Freeport-McMoRan, a straight-out mining firm with a major position in the production of molybdenum, copper, and gold. The company, from its base in Phoenix, Arizona, has extensive mining operations in both North and South America, and operates one of the world’s largest copper and gold mines, the Grasberg mine in Indonesia’s Papua region. Freeport-McMoRan is the world’s largest producer of molybdenum.Metals prices have been experiencing a surge due to high demand, with copper showing a particularly notable upward trend in recent years. The metal is up 19.5% from a trough last June, and has gained  more than 25% in the last 5 years. Freeport-McMoRan produced 832 million pounds of copper in 1Q23, along with 19 million pounds of molybdenum and 270,000 ounces of gold. The company foresees total consolidated sales this year of 4.1 billion pounds of copper, 79 million pounds of molybdenum, and 1.8 million ounces of gold. In the first quarter of this year, the company realized an average price of $4.11 per pound of copper, $30.32 per pound of molybdenum, and $1,949 per ounce for gold.Those production and price numbers generated the firm’s total Q1 revenue of $5.39 billion, which was down 18% y/y but came in $140 million better than expected. The non-GAAP EPS of 52 cents was less than half the $1.07 reported in 1Q22, but beat the forecast by 6 cents, or 13%. Freeport-McMoRan is supporting its mining ops with extensive exploration activities; the company’s exploration expense in Q1 was up 29% y/y, to $31 million.All of this adds up to a clear buying opportunity, in the eyes of Goldman’s Chieng, who writes: “We continue to view FCX favorably on consistent operational execution, leverage to copper price upside, and medium-to-long term brownfield growth optionality, and maintain our 12-month price target at $47.”Chieng’s Buy rating on the stock, and her $47 price target, suggest a 27% upside potential for the year ahead.Overall, FCX gets a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on 12 recent reviews that include 6 Buys, 5 Holds, and 1 Sell. The shares are priced at $36.87, and their one-year average price target of $46.67 implies a potential gain of ~27%. (See FCX stock forecast)Alcoa (AA)Last on our list of Goldman metal/mining picks is a name that may be familiar: Alcoa. Based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Alcoa is a perennial member of the global ‘top 10’ in aluminum producers, and is known for its production of high-end primary aluminum, fabricated aluminum, and alumina products. Alcoa’s aluminum end products are found in a wide range of products and industries, from automobiles and bicycles to airplanes and spacecraft, and even to such everyday items as home appliances and cookware.The company has felt pressure from the usual macroeconomic headwinds, in the form of high inflation and interest rates, along with supply chain disruptions, combining to increase the cost of production. At the same time, Alcoa has remained profitable – and has even achieved its industry’s lowest carbon footprint.The effects of this can be seen in Alcoa’s recent 1Q23 earnings release, and in its outlook for Q2. The company had a Q1 top line of $2.67 billion, down almost 19% year-over-year and missing the forecast by $90 million. The bottom line EPS, in non-GAAP terms, came to a net loss of 23 cents per share – where the Street had expected a break-even. Looking ahead, Alcoa is expecting a $115 million increase in the cost of energy and raw materials to offset a predicted increase in the realized third-party prices of both alumina and aluminum.In some positive notes, the company’s EBITDA passed $1 billion in 1Q23, setting a company record, and Alcoa finished the quarter with a solid cash balance of $1.1 billion, giving the company deep pockets to withstand a difficult economic situation.Goldman’s Chieng is bullish on Alcoa, seeing the company as more than capable of expanding its business despite the headwinds. Putting her thoughts in a recent note, she writes: “We continue to view AA positively, driven by (1) ~9% aluminum volume growth in the next two years (driven by production restarts) and (2) the company’s leverage to aluminum price upside which remains the more important driver of the company’s earnings profile; specifically, on our ~$2,700/t assumption for 2023, we estimate that the aluminum segment comprises ~75% of attributable EBITDA.”Quantifying her stance, Chieng gives Alcoa stock a price target of $54 alongside a Buy rating; this implies an upside of 51% on the one-year time frame.Even though the Goldman view is bullish here, Wall Street is taking a more cautious approach. Alcoa shares have a Hold rating from the analyst consensus, based on 8 reviews that include 3 Buys, 4 Holds, and 1 Sell. However, the stock’s $35.83 trading price and $47.75 average price target suggest a one-year upside potential of 34%.

607,19f0b698-0c49-3acc-adaa-6fb7dff97748,FCX,2023-04-28,Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/freeport-mcmoran-inc-fcx-attracting-130001589.html,1682600401,STORY,['FCX'],"[Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this mining company have returned -5.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry, which Freeport-McMoRan falls in, has gained 1.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Freeport-McMoRan is expected to post earnings of $0.50 per share, indicating a change of -13.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.03 points to a change of -16.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +4.2%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.30 indicates a change of +13.2% from what Freeport-McMoRan is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.7%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Freeport-McMoRan is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for FCX _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Freeport-McMoRan, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $5.99 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +10.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $23.82 billion and $24.09 billion estimates indicate +4.6% and +1.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryFreeport-McMoRan reported revenues of $5.39 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -18.4%. EPS of $0.52 for the same period compares with $1.07 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.45 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.07%. The EPS surprise was +10.64%.Over the last four quarters, Freeport-McMoRan surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Freeport-McMoRan is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Freeport-McMoRan. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

608,cfbe45bb-9c21-39ad-a324-78612fe68cf3,PEP,2023-04-28,25 Largest Beverage Companies in the Word in 2023,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/25-largest-beverage-companies-word-072323821.html,1682666603,STORY,"['KO', 'DEO', 'KDP', 'BF-B', 'STZ', 'PEP', 'MNST', 'ABEV', 'CABGY']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 25 largest beverage companies in the world in 2023. For more companies, head on over to 5 Largest Beverage Companies in the Word in 2023. These days, the biggest worry on everyone's mind is a potential recession in America. The economic turmoil that has been ravaging the world over the past couple of years has nearly destroyed the finances of developing countries and put advanced economies under strain as well. Take the example of China, where millions of fresh graduates with advanced degrees are struggling to find a job as the economy slowly starts after shutting down during the pandemic.At the same time, in the U.S. there is a growing worry of a potential default as the economy slows down in the wake of the Federal Reserve's rapid interest rate hikes to combat inflation. While members of the House were quick to pass a Republican sponsored bill in late April 2023 by voting two thirds to suspend normal rules, there are concerns that a showdown in Senate could very well place the U.S. on a default trajectory.But why bring up macroeconomics in a post about the biggest beverage companies in the world? Well, this is because the beverages sector is often quite resilient in a recessionary environment. Of course, the key word to note here is recession 'resistant' and not recession 'proof', since no industry is truly and absolutely immune to a drop in incomes and a slowdown in spending. Looking at what the professionals are saying, a study from Morningstar provides some important insights on this topic.In the aftermath of the 2008 economic crisis, Morningstar reported that the beverage industry was undervalued with an average value to fair price estimate of 0.88. It also highlighted that as spending fell, consumers became more price conscious which in turn saw the alcoholic beverages offered by Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) grow their sales. Additionally, other large companies such as Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) and Brown-Forman Corporation (NYSE:BF-B) were cash flow healthy. At the same time, brand loyalty also helped the beverage firms stay afloat, as Morningstar points out that brands such as Diageo's Johnnie Walker endured the recession well as customers continue to drink the spirit even as they canceled vacations.Story continuesAs a whole though, the beverages industry is made of both alcoholic and non-alcoholic products. In fact, the top five of the 16 Most Valuable Beverage Brands in the World are all non-alcoholic brands, and some of the biggest companies in the world such as The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) also make and sell non-alcoholic drinks. Naturally, since the current economic turmoil has been in place for over a year now, it's relevant to take a look at how well these companies are performing. On this front, Coca-Cola has recovered its revenue drop since the coronavirus pandemic and has grown top line sales since 2020. In fact, last year's inflationary wave also helped the beverage company, since it grew its revenue to $43 billion in 2022 from the $38.6 billion that it had raked in the previous year.Taking a look at the beverage industry as a whole, a research report from The Business Research Company estimates that the industry was worth $3.5 trillion last year, and despite the expected global slowdown, will grow to $3.7 trillion by the end of this year to mark a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.7%. It adds that from 2023 until 2027, the growth will decelerate a bit to sit at 5.4%, which will lead to a final value of $4.6 trillion for the global beverage market by the end of the forecast time period.Since it is one of the, if not the, biggest beverage companies in the world, a brief look at Coca-Cola's latest earnings call provides valuable details for what to expect from the beverages market. During the event, executives shared:Firstly, as John said, we feel confident about our outlook to drive the year [2023] from the top line. Let me connect that perhaps starting to 2022. As we commented, we saw steady volume growth through the year, including the fourth quarter. I know we reported a headline number of minus one. But if you accommodate the suspension of Russia and the COVID restrictions in China and take a three-year CAGR of volume growth, you see a pretty constant growth momentum through the year. And we would also comment that, that growth momentum has continued into the beginning of inflation. So we see strong underlying volume momentum or ongoing volume momentum that we have been able to achieve by our focus on the marketing innovation, the RGM and the execution to accommodate the need for affordability and premiumization in the phase inflation.And as John commented, we do see both inflation moderating as we go through 2023 and of course, our own pricing PMO beginning to moderate as we go through ’23 in part because, the input costs inflation is moderating, but also because we begin to cycle some of the price increases from 2022. And what that’s likely to net out as obviously, we’ve given a seven to eight for the full year. And what we’re likely to see is the beginning of the Q1, we’re likely to see revenue growth more close to what — the sort of levels we were achieving coming out of last year. And that then logically, the organic growth rate moderates as we get towards the end of the year, looking to close out on a more normalized level of revenue growth. And then when you average that out, you get to the seven to eight.se deWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the biggest beverage companies in the world, out of which the top players are The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Kweichow Moutai Co., Ltd.

Quarterly revenue totaled $17.8 billion, above expectations and improving 10% from the year-ago quarter.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchInvestors cheered on the results, with PEP shares closing 2.5% higher post-earnings. The company’s shares have regularly gotten a boost following quarterly releases, as we can see illustrated below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRegarding the strong results, CEO Ramon Laguarta said, “We are very pleased with our performance and business momentum as our categories and geographies remained resilient during the first quarter. Given our strong start to the year, we now expect our full-year 2023 organic revenue to increase 8 percent (previously 6 percent) and core constant currency EPS to increase 9 percent (previously 8 percent).” And consistent with its previous guidance for FY23, PepsiCo expects total cash returns to shareholders to total roughly $7.7 billion, consisting of $6.7 billion in dividends and share repurchases of $1 billion.Kimberly-ClarkKimberly-Clark also posted a double-beat, exceeding earnings expectations by nearly 25%. Top line results were also solid, with the company generating $5.2 billion in revenue and improving modestly from the year-ago quarter.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, KMB’s gross margin increased 340 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable net revenue realization amid increased prices. Cash generated from operations totaled $613 million, reflecting a sizable jump from the year-ago value of $204 million.KMB shares saw a nice reaction from the market post-earnings, closing 1.5% higher. The market has had somewhat-mixed reactions following quarterly releases from Kimberly-Clark, as shown below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company raised its FY23 EPS guidance, now expecting 6% - 10% growth compared to FY22 and up from prior views of 2% - 6%.

Earnings improved 3% year-over-year, whereas revenue saw growth of 4%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchImpressively, PG’s recently declared dividend increase reflects the 67th consecutive year that the company has increased its dividend.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read Dividend Champions vs Aristocrats: 5 Under-the-Radar Stocks to Consider. Dividend Aristocrats are companies in the S&amp;P 500 Index that have increased their dividend payouts for at least 25 consecutive years. Meanwhile, ""Dividend Champions"" refers to companies that have increased their dividend payouts for at least 25 consecutive years but are not necessarily in the S&amp;P 500 Index.These companies are popular among investors as they typically have strong financials, stable earnings, and a proven track record of delivering value to their investors over time. Moreover, dividend stocks have also exhibited strong performance over the years, especially during market downturns. According to a report by Nuveen, companies that have raised their dividends perform well, compared with those that have high yields. The report mentioned that dividend growers with modest yields delivered a 26.8% return on equity in 2022, compared with a 20.4% return on stocks with yields above 3%. The report also referred to FactSet and mentioned that the MSCI World Index generated 5.5% dividend growth in 2022.When investing in dividend stocks, investors also pay attention to dividend-focused exchange-traded funds. These funds offer investors a diversified portfolio of dividend-paying stocks, which makes them an easy and reliable investment option. In 2022, investors poured over $47 billion in dividend ETFs, as reported by State Street Global Advisors. The report also mentioned that more than 90% of these funds outperformed the market last year. The report mentioned that the low fundamental volatility of dividend stocks is one of the main drivers for the outperformance of these strategies. Some of the best dividend stocks that have raised their dividends over the years include PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).Story continuesThe S&amp;P High-Yield Dividend Aristocrats tracks the performance of companies within the S&amp;P Composite 1500 that have raised their dividends for at least 20 years. The index outperformed the S&amp;P Composite 1500 by an average of 140 basis points from December 1999 to December 2022, according to a report by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. Various other pieces of research have shown that dividend growers have outperformed historically. In one of our previous articles titled S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats List, we reported that dividend aristocrats have delivered an annual average return of 12.13% between 1990 and 2018, compared with a 9.96% return of the broader market during the same period.Dividend Champions vs Aristocrats: 12 Under-the-Radar Stocks to ConsiderPhoto by Vitaly Taranov on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this article, we scanned the list of Dividend Champions, companies that have raised their dividends for 25 years or more, and picked companies that are comparatively lesser known to investors but are reliable investment options.

McDonald's (MCD) has hinted at a new digital enhancement that allows employees to know when a customer is nearby so they can begin prepping their food. Even execs from the big soft drink and snack makers — The Coca-Cola Co. (KO) and PepsiCo (PEP) — have weighed in. But the fast-fooders have been the real players. Here's a pocket guide to some innovations — and a few yellow flags as well:ChipotleIn a call with investors, CEO Brian Niccol said the fast-casual chain has discussed the idea of AI internally.""We've worked with a lot of our employees to identify what are the tasks that they would love to see us bring automation to, or AI, so that hopefully, the role can become less complicated...I think there's just other places in the back of the restaurant where we have the ability to automate, whether it's on the digital make-line or other tasks...""For instance, last fall Chipotle rolled out testing for a new kitchen management system to streamline operations, plus a new robot called Chippy that makes tortilla chips.Then, in an interview with Yahoo Finance on Wednesday, Chipotle CFO Jack Hartung said AI presents ""endless possibilities"" that it is exploring with its Cultivate Next fund. This new venture is intended to invest in ""forward-thinking ventures that are looking to drive meaningful change at scale [and] will help accelerate Chipotle's aggressive growth plans,"" per the release.Hartung warned, though, ""there's also a lot of pitfalls as well, so we want to be very careful, very thoughtful.""He added: ""Certainly, if there's ways we can make the job that our crews, do the jobs that our support staff do to support a restaurant easier, better and if the end result is we can run better restaurants and serve the customers in a better way, we're certainly going to look at any technology.""Story continuesFuture chips: Chippy, is an autonomous kitchen assistant that integrates culinary traditions with artificial intelligence to make tortilla chips.

(NASDAQ: CELH) has been publicly traded since 2006, but the stock has only recently gained significant traction. Just three years ago, the company was trading at around $4.50 per share; today, it has skyrocketed to nearly $92 per share, a staggering 1945% increase. So, what has fueled this massive multi-year climb?It's crucial to recognize the energy drink market's incredible profitability, which often goes unnoticed. For instance, Monster Beverage Corp. (NASDAQ: MNST) has emerged as the top-performing stock of the past twenty-five years, outpacing even Apple Inc. and Amazon.com, Inc. Additionally, the retail market has shown impressive gains, with startups like Pureboost raising nearly $3 million from retail investors for its first-of-its-kind clean energy drink mix. Taking Celsius' massive success into account, it's clear that this market has vast potential.Celsius' transformation primarily began when their new CEO, John Fieldly, assumed leadership in 2018. As various brands pivoted towards cleaner and healthier options, Celsius brought this trend to the energy drink market, resulting in significant success and attracting investors' attention.See More: A Healthier Alternative to Coffee &amp; Energy Drinks: Pureboost Gives You Energy Without The Burnout and ExhaustionCelsius has not only expanded its presence in tens of thousands of stores across the country, but it also recently secured a deal with PepsiCo, Inc. This partnership enables Pepsi to become a distributor of the Celsius brand and includes a $550 million investment from Pepsi.Considering the company's massive rally, is there still room for growth? Monster currently boasts a $56 billion market cap and approximately ten times the sales of Celsius. This suggests that if Celsius can capture market share from Monster and other traditional giants, there is ample potential for further expansion. However, convincing consumers to switch brands may prove to be a challenge.Story continuesSee more on startup investing from Benzinga.Collaborative Robots Startup Using Teams Of AI-Powered Drones To Make Flying SaferAI Startups Turn to Retail Investors To Fund the Growth of the $1.59 Trillion Artificial Intelligence MarketDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

And more.Over the last few days, consumer companies including Coca-Cola (KO) and Pepsi (PEP) have talked about the role AI could play in their business.As purveyors of soft drinks, salty snacks, and burritos, it is hard to see where AI enhancements to workflows and best practices might really shake things up for these businesses.Other than, of course, lowering costs in businesses that are already relentlessly managed to maximize profits.Results from Microsoft (MSFT) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), however, more concretely brought home the reason AI's potential ought to be taken seriously as matching the runaway hype.And as readers may likely anticipate, it is because of how AI has changed the thinking companies have around search that profound impacts may come to pass.As Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer noted Wednesday, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said Tuesday on a call with investors, ""As we look towards a future where chat becomes a new way for people to seek information, consumers have real choice in business model and modalities with Azure-powered chat entry points across Bing, Edge, Windows and OpenAI's ChatGPT. We look forward to continuing this journey in what is a generational shift in the largest software category, search.""Last week, we argued tech's obsession with AI was actually about a war happening in search. This view was and continues to be fueled by simply reading the comments of the CEO of the most powerful enterprise tech company in the world.Story continuesBut if we broaden the notion of ""search"" beyond the walls of consumers looking for restaurants or new running sneakers, what we're really talking about is how data is collated, warehoused, and searched.Many investors will hear consumer goods companies talk about AI and recall the days when every company felt compelled to comment on ""blockchain."" Which has, to some extent, still not worn off — just on Wednesday, economic commentator Larry Summers said he is long blockchain and short bitcoin (BTC-USD).As Julie Hyman wrote Wednesday, some Wall Street strategists have tabbed hype around AI as boosting the stock market this year.But to invoke another investing cliché from years gone by, if data really is the new oil, then how companies extract and understand that data will determine which earn the outsized returns promised by tech's latest revolution.In its most recent quarters, Alphabet earned $17.4 billion in operating income; Microsoft recognized $18.3 billion in net income over the same period.The opportunity AI presents is to grow these winnings many times over.And that's no punchline for investors.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Along the way, users will have the chance to unlock special giveaways, including the free, limited-edition Pepsi and Pepsi Zero Sugar can collection for the first 400 participants that discover and complete the redemption screen.""I'm proud to partner with Pepsi to celebrate the rich diversity of Latin music on International Dance Day through my biggest passion – dance,"" said Smart. ""Latin music has been a continual source of inspiration throughout my career, and I'm excited to be a part of this campaign that celebrates the universal language of music,"" he continued. ""No matter your dance skill level, we invite everyone to come find their step at Muévelo con Pepsi in the metaverse, and grab yourself a free set of the limited-edition can collection.""Limited-Edition Pepsi and Pepsi Zero Sugar Can CollectionInspired by the vibrant U.S. cities where Latin music continues to grow in popularity, the exclusive Pepsi and Pepsi Zero Sugar can collection celebrates five of the many different genres that have transcended their countries to become chart-toppers in the U.S. Each of the cans is dedicated to one of the five genres – Banda, Cumbia, Norteño, Salsa and Reggaeton – and include artistic nods to the culture, people and places in each city where these genres have become a part of the community. The musicians featured on each can hold an instrument or piece of equipment unique to their genre, which collectively form a single Latin fusion band when all cans are placed together side-by-side.Los Angeles - Banda: Scenes of a laid-back Los Angeles lifestyle are depicted on the can where the love for street vendors and celebration of lowrider car culture merge with beachside scenes, outdoor activities and plenty of dancing to the lively brass sounds of Banda music.Chicago - Cumbia: The wind blows through Chicago's iconic city skyline where architectural landmarks and the food truck community create the backdrop for the Cumbia can. The booming and resonating notes of the accordion play across the scene to create upbeat, bold rhythms that have locals dancing anywhere the music plays.Texas - Norteño: Everything is bigger in Texas, including the love of Norteño music. The can design features nods to Texas' many nuances – from its nickname of the Lone Star State and being home to the NASA Space Center to the glittering city skylines of Dallas and Houston and the vast desert landscapes. The bajo sexto (sixth bass) is front and center as one of the key instruments helping create the authentic Norteño sound.New York - Salsa: The Salsa can has a design that is uniquely New York and pays tribute to the city's most recognizable landmarks like the Statue of Liberty, Yankee Stadium and the Brooklyn Bridge, with visual callouts to New York's fast-paced lifestyle, like cabs, food carts and dancing in the streets. Central to the Salsa sound is the conga drum creating a high-tempo beat that moves your feet.Miami - Reggaeton: Follow this music phenomenon all the way down to Miami's Calle Ocho where Latin rhythms and beats fuse to bring people to the dance floor. The can design is inspired by the city's art deco architecture, vintage style cars, views of iconic Miami Beach and swaying palm trees to create a sunny scene in celebration of Reggaeton music.The Muévelo Con Pepsi metaverse dance class is just one of many new ways that Pepsi continues to connect fans with their favorite passion points, especially music. In 2022, Pepsi announced the new Pepsi Music Lab, an annual academy committed to shining a spotlight on the next generation of superstars by removing industry barriers and providing performance opportunities, mentorship and coaching, brand-building workshops, content capture, radio amplification and more. Three Latin artists were chosen for the Pepsi Music Lab Class of '22 – '23 including: Samy Hawk, a Venezuelan artist whose sound blends rap and hip-hop with elements of funk and pop; Nohemy, who infuses her Puerto Rican heritage into a modern Latin Pop-Urban sound; and SERGIO who derives his Latin Pop sound from his Mexican-American NorCal upbringing. On April 29, all three artists will join the Muévelo Con Pepsi metaverse experience and invite their fans to do the same.For more information about Muévelo con Pepsi, visit MueveloConPepsi.com.*Open to legal U.S. residents of 50 US and DC, 18 or older at time of registration.

618,94cc6cb6-ea5a-3e25-b89a-260144d3be00,REGN,2023-04-28,Regeneron (REGN) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Can the Stock Move Higher?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/regeneron-regn-expected-beat-earnings-140202013.html,1682604122,STORY,['REGN'],"[The market expects Regeneron (REGN) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 4. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis biopharmaceutical company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $9.25 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -19.5%.Revenues are expected to be $2.92 billion, down 1.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.04% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Regeneron?For Regeneron, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +4.41%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Regeneron will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Regeneron would post earnings of $9.68 per share when it actually produced earnings of $12.56, delivering a surprise of +29.75%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Regeneron appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

619,974fa53f-ef88-331f-b8a8-4ec54258bddf,UNP,2023-04-28,California passes 1st-in-nation emission rules for trains,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/california-vote-ambitious-locomotive-emission-093815323.html,1682588295,STORY,['UNP'],"[SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California approved Thursday a first-in-the-nation, ambitious rule limiting rail pollution to aggressively cut greenhouse gas emissions in the state's latest move to establish itself as a global leader in the fight against climate change.The rule will ban locomotive engines more than 23 years old by 2030 and increase the use of zero-emissions technology to transport freight from ports and throughout railyards. It would also ban locomotives in the state from idling longer than 30 minutes if they are equipped with an automatic shutoff.“It is time to kickstart the next step of transformation, with trains,” said Davina Hurt, a California Air Resources Board member.The standards would also reduce chemicals that contribute to smog. They could improve air quality near railyards and ports.But some say it’s too soon for the locomotive standards. Wayne Winegarden, a Pacific Research Institute senior fellow, said the rule would be expensive for rail companies, and increased costs will mean higher prices for many goods that move by rail.The Association of American Railroads said in a statement “there is no clear path to zero emissions locomotives.”“Mandating that result ignores the complexity and interconnected nature of railroad operations and the reality of where zero emission locomotive technology and the supporting infrastructure stand,” the group wrote.Freight railways are an efficient means to transport the roughly 1.6 billion tons of goods nationwide across nearly 140,000 miles (225,308 kilometers), much cleaner than if those goods were trucked, it said.The transportation sector contributed the largest share of greenhouse gas emissions nationwide in 2020, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. But rail only accounts for about 2% of those emissions.Kristen South, a Union Pacific spokesperson, said in a statement the rail company is “deeply disappointed” by the vote, adding that the rule is too ambitious for the current technology and infrastructure.Story continuesUnion Pacific is working to cut greenhouse gas emissions in part by spending $1 billion to modernize locomotives and testing out engines powered by electric batteries, South wrote.Cecilia Garibay, a project coordinator with the 50-member Moving Forward Network based at Occidental College, said California needs “the strongest, most protective in-use locomotive regulation"" that sets an example for the nation.The standards would need approval from the Biden administration to move forward. They follow rules approved by the EPA to cut emissions from heavy trucks.Locomotives pull rail cars filled with food, lumber, oil and other products through railyards near neighborhoods in Oakland, Commerce, San Bernardino and other California cities.They run on diesel, a more powerful fuel than gasoline, producing greenhouse gases and pollution that is harmful for nearby residents.Other states can sign on to try to adopt the California rule if it gets the OK from the Biden administration.The rule is the most ambitious of its kind in the country.“The locomotive rule has the power to change the course of history for Californians who have suffered from train pollution for far too long, and it is my hope that our federal regulators follow California’s lead,” said Yasmine Agelidis, a lawyer with environmental nonprofit Earthjustice, in a statement.Diesel exhaust is a health hazard. According to California regulators, diesel emissions are responsible for some 70% of Californians' cancer risk from toxic air pollution. The rule would curb emissions on a class of engines that annually release more than 640 tons of tiny pollutants that can enter deep into a person's lungs and worsen asthma, and release nearly 30,000 tons of smog-forming emissions known as nitrogen oxides. The rule would also drastically cut greenhouse gas emissions from locomotives, by an amount akin to removing all heavy-duty trucks from the state by 2030.It's important to tackle emissions from a sector that often burdens low-income residents and communities of color, and that has plans to expand passenger rail, said Air Resources Board Chair Liane M. Randolph.Rail companies can participate in incentive programs run by the state to ease the cost of transitioning to zero-emissions locomotives, the agency said.California has already set out to make big emissions cuts in other areas. The state approved a transition to zero-emissions cars and a roadmap to achieve carbon neutrality, meaning it would remove as many carbon emissions as it releases, by 2045. The board is also considering a rule to electrify a group of heavy trucks that transports goods through ports.For activists and residents who’ve lived in areas affected by heavy rail pollution, the fight for cleaner trains is decades in the making.Jan Victor Andasan, an activist with East Yard Communities for Environmental Justice, grew up in West Long Beach and now organizes residents there. It's a neighborhood near the twin ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach that is “surrounded by pollution” from trains, trucks and industry.“We support rail, but we support rail if they’re doing all their best to mitigate their emissions,” Andasan said.Residents shared stories Thursday of children who live near railways having to share inhalers to ease asthma symptoms and families taking extreme measures to rid their homes of diesel fumes.Some activists would like California to go further, for example, to limit locomotive idling to 15 minutes. They are also concerned that increased demand from online shopping is causing more rail traffic that burdens communities.The EPA recently approved California rules requiring zero-emission trucks, depending on the type, to make up between 40% and 75% of sales by 2035.Heidi Swillinger lives in a mobile home park in San Pablo, a small city in the San Francisco Bay Area, along the BNSF Railway. She estimates that her home is just 20 feet (6 meters) from the tracks. She said it’s not uncommon for diesel fumes to fill her house, resulting in a “thick, acrid, dirty smell.”“Nobody wants to live next to a railroad track,” Swillinger said. “You move next to a railroad track because you don’t have other options.”___Sophie Austin is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

It will be modestly dilutive to the company's profit over the next three years.Excluding one-off items, Quest's profit was $2.04 per share for the quarter ended March 31, higher than analysts' average estimate of $1.97 cents per share, according to Refinitiv data.The company revised its annual adjusted profit forecast to between $8.45 per share and $8.95 per share from $8.40 per share and $9 per share.

This compares to earnings of $3.22 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3.55%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this medical laboratory operator would post earnings of $1.90 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.98, delivering a surprise of 4.21%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Quest Diagnostics , which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Outpatient and Home Healthcare industry, posted revenues of $2.33 billion for the quarter ended March 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.80%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.61 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Quest Diagnostics shares have lost about 6.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 5.6%.What's Next for Quest Diagnostics?While Quest Diagnostics has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Quest Diagnostics: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future.

The current consensus EPS estimate is $2.25 on $2.26 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $8.71 on $8.96 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Medical - Outpatient and Home Healthcare is currently in the top 30% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, Addus HomeCare (ADUS), has yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2023. The results are expected to be released on May 1.This provider of home-based personal care, nursing and rehabilitative therapy services is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.91 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +18.2%.

(NYSE:AMP) stock at an average sell price of US$350 during the past year. The company's market valuation decreased by US$2.7b after the stock price dropped 7.4% over the past week, but insiders were spared from painful losses.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Ameriprise Financial Ameriprise Financial Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chairman &amp; CEO, James Cracchiolo, for US$14m worth of shares, at about US$353 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$293. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.In the last year Ameriprise Financial insiders didn't buy any company stock.

Specifically, insiders ditched US$24m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Does Ameriprise Financial Boast High Insider Ownership?For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Ameriprise Financial insiders own 0.4% of the company, currently worth about US$122m based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Ameriprise Financial Tell Us?Insiders sold Ameriprise Financial shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company.

RWAY, Cisco Systems CSCO, Kimberly Clark KMB, NiSource NI and Omnicom Group OMC.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:5 Top Ultra-Safe Stocks to Buy as Economic Downturn LoomsElevated prices of essential commodities, considerably higher interest rates, and at present tightening credit situations no doubt are likely to weigh on business investment and consumer outlays in the United States. First-quarter GDP growth is widely expected to be moderate, while the index of future economic activity recently posted a record drop, indicating a forthcoming economic slump.The Leading Economic Index (LEI) of the Conference Board dropped to 108.4 in March from the revised reading of 109.7 in February and has registered the 12th monthly drop in a row. It’s also the lowest reading since November 2020, when the economy grappled with the outbreak of the coronavirus.From September 2022 to March 2023, the LEI fell by 4.5%, thereby signaling a recession for quite a long time. Justyna Zabinska-La Monica, Senior Manager at the Conference Board, in reality, expects the U.S. economy to be in recession by mid-2023 (read more: 5 Top Stocks to Buy as Recession Fright Intensifies).Investment activities in businesses, meanwhile, are softening, thanks to stubbornly high inflation. Orders for durable goods have decreased in recent times, while spending took a beating due to the higher cost of capital. China’s reopening and solid first-quarter GDP growth are yet to uplift business sentiment in the United States.Being an interest-rate-sensitive sector, housing is also struggling at the moment. Home sales lessened over the past year, while construction activities decreased, indicating substantial pressure on the housing sector in the upcoming months. Let us also not forget that housing affordability remains at an all-time low.Story continuesAmid all these, the banking crisis in the United States has increased worries about economic growth. The recent collapse of some of the regional banks has impacted credit growth, and in all likelihood, is expected to derail real GDP growth. What’s more, First Republic Banks’ recent declaration that its deposits decreased significantly in the first quarter reignited fears about the current health of the entire banking system.The United States, by the way, is already witnessing a freight recession, signaling a broader slowdown in economic growth. Fewer trucks are now delivering goods, leading to a significant decline in diesel prices.Given that the United States is worryingly close to an economic downturn, the stock market is now undoubtedly subjected to bouts of volatility. Hence, astute investors should place their bets on ultra-safe stocks that can counter such upheavals in the market and provide a steady stream of income.To select such stocks, we have chosen those that have a low beta (ranges from 0 to 1), making them unperturbed to market vagaries.

In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector lost 0.91%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 2.19%.Cisco Systems will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be May 17, 2023. On that day, Cisco Systems is projected to report earnings of $0.98 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 12.64%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $14.39 billion, up 12.1% from the prior-year quarter.CSCO's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $3.76 per share and revenue of $56.56 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +11.9% and +9.69%, respectively.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Cisco Systems. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Cisco Systems is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Looking at its valuation, Cisco Systems is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 12.38. This represents a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 16.79.Story continuesWe can also see that CSCO currently has a PEG ratio of 1.9.

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Cisco Systems (CSCO) earns a Zacks Rank #2 20 days from its next quarterly earnings release on May 17, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.99 a share.Cisco Systems' Earnings ESP sits at 1.45%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.99 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.98.CSCO is part of a big group of Computer and Technology stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Toast (TOST) as well.Toast, which is readying to report earnings on May 9, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently -$0.16 a share, and TOST is 12 days out from its next earnings report.Story continuesToast's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 9.86% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of -$0.18.Because both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, CSCO and TOST could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

631,f263b691-9ba7-3582-9d41-221ba3e78b4c,CSCO,2023-04-28,Akvo: The Next Generation of Data Collection for Sustainable Development,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/akvo-next-generation-data-collection-122000568.html,1682598000,STORY,['CSCO'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / April 27, 2023 / Cisco Systems Inc.Cisco Systems Inc., Thursday, April 27, 2023, Press release pictureCisco is proud to support Akvo, which provides data services and tech solutions to development partners in the water, agriculture, and climate sectors. We know that data is critical for effective decision-making, collaboration, and accountability. Akvo supports agencies and governments around the world to improve their programs so they can achieve lasting impact.This post comes from Joy Ghosh, Akvo's Tech Lead. Joy has been working in the field of data and technology for development for the past 10 years, and specializes in building data platforms for the agriculture and water sectors.Here's how data is usually collected in the development sector. Let's say a project is set up to improve the income of smallholder farmers or achieve safe water access in a certain region. Enumerators are sent out to collect data on the communities which are impacted by these issues. Interventions are then put in place to improve the outcomes and contribute towards impact. At the end of the program, enumerators are sent out once again to collect data and monitor change. But what if we could supplement this tried and tested method of data collection with continuous input from the field, rather than just baseline data at the beginning and the end of a program? And what if, rather than knocking on doors to collect data, community members had a platform to share information on their challenges and needs. What if we could use data collection as a tool for continuous community engagement?With support from the Cisco Foundation, we've been developing technologies to make this a reality. Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) and phone-based data collection is often seen as a cost-saving alternative to field data collection - ideal for situations in which you can't go into the field due to health or security emergencies. But this technology should be seen as a complement to in-person field data collection, and the benefits go far beyond reduced costs and security challenges.Story continuesA hybrid approach to monitoringToday, enumerators are sent out into the field to find respondents from whom to gather data. This traditional method of data collection has clear benefits - enumerators can observe first-hand what's going on in the field, and project managers receive comprehensive, quality datasets. However, there are also numerous drawbacks.In-person data collection is resource-intensive and therefore periodical. The lack of continuous, timely data means that often, interventions are detached from the realities on the ground. Field-based data collection provides snapshots into the current situation, rather than continuous feedback that allows program managers to fill in the context, and adjust strategies based on evidence. Using a hybrid approach to data collection - remote and in person - could help to complete the picture. Program managers can use remote data collection to gain a broad understanding of a specific problem, and then in-person data collection to focus on potential problem areas. Alternatively, in-field data collection can be conducted at, for example, annual intervals, and then remote data collection can fill in the gaps and provide context continually. This would allow program managers to see change as it occurs, allowing for more timely responses, targeted interventions, and better results.In-person data collection is also a physically exhausting process. The sheer logistical challenges may lead to enumerators collecting data from 10 people in one village and none from the surrounding five, resulting in a skewed sample. With remote data collection, you have the potential to exceed your sample, reaching a much wider geographical scope with significantly less resources.Finally, in-person data collection makes it difficult to seek out local change makers in the community, and brings to the fore questions of data ownership. What are the incentives for respondents to give away their time and their data? Does the data still belong to them? And how, if at all, does the data get fed back into the community? Innovations in remote data collection technology could allow for a more citizen-centered approach.Harnessing the power of remote in KenyaIn Kenya, Akvo created a system for distributing, accessing and responding to surveys via radio and text messaging in cooperation with county governments of Kajiado, Laikipia and Kwale, Central FM Kenya Radio, and Africa's Talking, a local USSD aggregator. Akvo and Africa's Talking jointly produced an Application Programming Interface (API) integration that allows surveys, traditionally administered by a mobile surveying application, to be received and completed via text message. We partnered with Central FM Kenya Radio to establish a schedule for broadcasting USSD codes to listeners, analyzing and interpreting data alongside Health Authority Officials, and distributing survey results.Radio DJs that host interviews with representatives of Kenya Water for Health Organization received data process training and then broadcast the USSD codes to listeners. Each time a survey was announced, the DJ would explain that answers from completed surveys would be automatically sent to county databases and live data visualizations (maps, charts, and graphs) would be updated. DJs actively distributed survey codes, observed responses coming-in, updated live data visualization dashboards, interpreted results in conjunction with Health Officials, and communicated updated information back to the community regarding two thematic areas: integrated water management and gender-based violence.This approach allows organizations to ask the community directly for input, be it in relation to their water facilities, healthcare, food security, or any other societal issue. This has a host of benefits, including:Raising awareness around the issue at hand by broadcasting itGathering data at regular intervals via broadcast for a fraction of the costIdentifying individuals in the community who care about and actively participate in community issues, because they come to you, rather than you going to themIntroducing incentives for feeding in data continuously and on a timely basis (through gamification, for example)Feeding data directly back to the community - they are aware and involved in the problem and empowered with opportunities to contribute to the solutionThis pilot is one of many that we've been testing in various sectors and contexts with support from the Cisco Foundation, and shows how traditional data collection methods in the development sector can be innovated to improve results. At the time of writing this blog we are in a scaling phase, aiming to support an additional 10 partners (government and organizations) this year with crowdsourcing solutions such as USSD.What's next for the sectorJust like the switch from pen and paper data collection to smartphone-based data collection, this evolution will take time and learning. There are numerous benefits to remote data collection if used in the right way and in the right context, but we have to learn which methods are best suited to which contexts, and what the drawbacks and challenges are. Beyond that, we have to think differently about how data should be collected based on the different mediums. For example, you can't run the same survey on USSD as you would in an in-person survey because it would be too long and too cumbersome for the respondent. This is where design thinking comes into play, and program managers consider what data is needed, how that data is best collected, and what obstacles there may be.We're continuing this work to identify the best practices, challenges, and opportunities, with financial support and technical advice support from the Cisco Foundation.View original content hereView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/751619/Akvo-The-Next-Generation-of-Data-Collection-for-Sustainable-Development]"
