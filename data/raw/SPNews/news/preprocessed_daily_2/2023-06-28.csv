1,c5dbc69d-bd74-3bc9-a68b-4f51d22ded32,SCHW,2023-06-28,Is Schwab MarketTrack Growth Investor (SWHGX) a Strong Mutual Fund Pick Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schwab-markettrack-growth-investor-swhgx-110006165.html,1687950006,STORY,['SCHW'],"[Mutual Fund Equity Report fund seekers should consider taking a look at Schwab MarketTrack Growth Investor (SWHGX). SWHGX holds a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 1 (Strong Buy), which is based on various forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.History of Fund/ManagerSchwab Funds is based in San Francisco, CA, and is the manager of SWHGX. Schwab MarketTrack Growth Investor made its debut in November of 1995, and since then, SWHGX has accumulated about $801.91 million in assets, per the most up-to-date date available. Zifan Tang is the fund's current manager and has held that role since February of 2012.PerformanceObviously, what investors are looking for in these funds is strong performance relative to their peers. This fund in particular has delivered a 5-year annualized total return of 5.52%, and it sits in the top third among its category peers. If you're interested in shorter time frames, do not dismiss looking at the fund's 3 -year annualized total return of 8.69%, which places it in the top third during this time-frame.It is important to note that the product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sale charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. SWHGX's standard deviation over the past three years is 14.81% compared to the category average of 17.2%. Over the past 5 years, the standard deviation of the fund is 15.66% compared to the category average of 15.16%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.Risk FactorsInvestors should note that the fund has a 5-year beta of 0.82, so it is likely going to be less volatile than the market at large. Another factor to consider is alpha, as it reflects a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark-in this case, the S&amp;P 500. SWHGX has generated a negative alpha over the past five years of -3.61, demonstrating that managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.Story continuesExpensesFor investors, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is key, since costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing. Competition is heating up in this space, and a lower cost product will likely outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, all things being equal. In terms of fees, SWHGX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.39% compared to the category average of 0.86%. So, SWHGX is actually cheaper than its peers from a cost perspective.This fund requires a minimum initial investment of $0, while there is no minimum for each subsequent investment.Fees charged by investment advisors have not been taken into considiration. Returns would be less if those were included.Bottom LineOverall, Schwab MarketTrack Growth Investor ( SWHGX ) has a high Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively strong performance, average downside risk, and lower fees, this fund looks like a good potential choice for investors right now.For additional information on the Mutual Fund Equity Report area of the mutual fund world, make sure to check out www.zacks.com/funds/mutual-funds.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on how to save for retirement and the worst states to retire to, you may jump directly to 5 Worst States to Retire in for Taxes and Cost of Living.Worst States to RetireRetirement; the final chapter of the American dream may seem far-fetched for the retiree today. Goldman Sachs Asset Management backs backs this and reports that 75% of retirees today are falling short of their retirement goals. A surprising 25% of retirees are able to save 70% of their incomes throughout their career. The remaining end up as empty nesters; dooming themselves to a downgraded lifestyle in their so-called golden periods.Even though a financial vortex is largely to blame for the lack of retirement savings; stumping retirees between life goals and urgent financial priorities, rising inflation and recession-scares are also culprits behind a broke retirement. Moreover, with social security and Medicare funds forecasted to be depleted in the near future, empty nesters may have a hard time in getting through their retirement years.According to the Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), number of hardship withdrawals, as of 2022, increased by 36% compared to the previous year. Inflation is largely to blame for the shaken consumer confidence. In order to regain this confidence, employers and plan sponsors such as Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) should regularly educate employees on sound retirement planning.In light of this, CNBC notes that the worst states to retire for taxes are New Jersey, Illinois, and New York. Provided that corporations such as Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), and even ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) proactively educate employees nearing retirement on taxes and financial planning, their likelihood of retiring to the right state increases tenfold.Story continuesWell-informed retirees already realize that the best states to retire tax wise are Alaska, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, Nevada, South Dakota, and Wyoming. They also know that the most tax friendly states may not offer the most affordable costs of living. In such cases, their best bet is to look for states that offer them the best of both worlds. Georgia, Mississippi, South Dakota, and Wyoming are the best states to retire in for taxes and cost of living both.Empty nesters should be looking to retire in these states that are both tax friendly and offer low costs of living. Mississippi, Alabama, Iowa, and Tennessee do not impose state income taxes on retiree incomes, making them some of the best states to retire on social security.  On the other hand, the 10 worst states to retire in are Vermont, New Hampshire, Oregon, Washington, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, California, Massachusetts, and Hawaii. Retirees should avoid retiring to these states if they wish for a comfortable retirement.Saving for RetirementThe US News &amp; World Report notes that almost 50% of people stopped contributing to their retirement funds in order to meet cost of living expenses. In this regard, the new legislation inculcating retirement-related provisions can help retirees manage emergency savings better. An allocated emergency savings account can help retirees save more by avoiding to tap into their retirement funds. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is already offering emergency saving options, and other corporations must follow suit for the sake of their employees.Another way corporations can help employees maximize their retirement savings is through matching contributions. These are the contributions that an employer makes to your retirement plan account, provided you contribute to the plan from your salary, grow tax-free, and become taxable when withdrawn from the plan. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) has an incredible matching program where 1% of contribution allows receiving company’s match of 6%.20 Worst States to Retire in for Taxes and Cost of LivingTim Roberts Photography/Shutterstock.comMethodologyIn order to compile the list of the worst states to retire in for taxes and cost of living, we picked out all the states that are not tax-friendly or only moderately tax friendly from Smart Asset. Next, we ranked them on the basis of cost of living index by state and sourced the data from Missouri Economic Research &amp; Information Center.Few of the moderately tax friendly states had low cost of living indices; which is why they were not selected for our list. Instead, tax friendly states with high costs of living; such as Virginia, Colorado, and Idaho were used instead.District of Columbia is also chosen for our list, even though it is not a state, due to the high taxes and costs of living in the region. States are ranked in an ascending order from lowest to highest costs of living.20. Rhode IslandCost of Living: 100.5One of the worst states for retirement due to taxes and cost of living, Rhode Island has a high overall tax burden. For starters, the median property tax rate in the state is the 15th highest all over the US. Seniors may also have to pay tax on their social security benefits, provided that their federal adjusted gross income is more than $119,750. The sales tax bite isn’t that severe, but Rhode Island is one of the few states that collect their own estate tax too. Excluding IRAs, seniors having attained the full retirement age may exclude up to $15,000 of income from their military, government, or private retirement plans. Cost of living is 0.5% above the national average in Rhode Island.19. UtahCost of Living: 101.5One of the few states that tax social security, Utah may not be the ideal place to retire. Pension and other types of retirement incomes are also subject to a 4.85% flat income tax rate levied by the state. However, seniors may claim a small credit against these taxes. Utah also has an above average combined state and local sales tax rate at 7.19%. Meanwhile, property tax rates are the 8th lowest in the state. Cost of living is 1.5% above national average.18. VirginiaCost of Living: 103.1Virginia isn’t exactly unfriendly for taxes, but combined with cost of living, retirees can certainly go for better options. Living costs in the state are 3.1% above the national average. Sales and property taxes are low. Income taxes in the state are generally a bit higher. Moreover, social security isn’t taxed, but other types of retirement incomes are deductible up to $12,000.17. MontanaCost of Living: 103.7In Montana, most types of retirement incomes are taxed.

ColoradoCost of Living: 105.5 In Colorado, cost of living is 5.5% higher than the state average. Meanwhile, the income tax system allows for a large tax deduction on retirement incomes. Taxpayers who fall under the age of 55 are allowed to exclude up to $15,000 from their military retirement plan. Railroad retirement benefits in Colorado are exempt from the state tax too. While property tax rates are low, sales tax is relatively high (excluding medicine and groceries); exceeding 11% in some parts of the state.15. IdahoCost of Living: 106.1While social security benefits aren’t taxable in Idaho, other types of retirement incomes are. Public and private pension incomes are partially taxed as well. Property and sales taxes are low. However, it is one of the few states that taxes groceries. There are no estate or inheritances taxes. Cost of living is 6.1% higher than the national average.14. ArizonaCost of Living: 107.2Arizona makes it to our list of the worst states to retire in for taxes and cost of living due to its moderate tax burden on retirees and high living costs. The state doesn’t tax social security benefits. However, distributions from 401(k) and other retirement accounts are taxed. Property taxes in the state maybe low, but combined sales taxes are high over 8%. Cost of living is 7.2% above the national average too.13. MaineCost of Living: 111.5One of the worst states to retire in for taxes and cost of living is Maine.

Cost of living is 11.5% above the national average.12. ConnecticutCost of Living: 113.1All types of retirement incomes are taxed under Connecticut’s income tax system.

The average effective property tax rate is high at 2.15%. Meanwhile, costs of living is 13.1% above the national average.11. New JerseyCost of Living: 114.1One of the least friendly states to retire to, New Jersey has a high cost of living at 14% above the national average. Social security incomes are not taxed, while state income tax for retirement incomes are also low. The low tax is applicable for pensions below $75,000 for single filers and $100,000 for joint filers. However, the deal breaker is the property tax rate; one of the highest in the US.10. VermontCost of Living: 114.9In Vermont, most of the retirement income is taxed. The rates may vary anywhere between 3.35% to 8.75%. Joint filers having federal adjusted gross income of $65,000 or less and other tax payers with an AGI of $50,000 or less are exempt from taxation of social security benefits.

AYI is slated to announce third-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Jun 29, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 20.5% and increased 19.1% year over year. The top line, however, lagged the consensus mark by 1.7% but increased 3.8% from the year-ago period.Acuity Brands beat earnings expectations in the trailing 12 quarters.Trend in Estimate RevisionFor the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share has increased to $3.62 from $3.60 in the past seven days. The estimate figure indicates an increase of 2.8% from $3.52 per share reported in the year-ago quarter. The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $1.04 billion, suggesting a 2.3% decrease from the year-ago reported figure of $1.06 billion.Acuity Brands Inc Price and EPS Surprise Acuity Brands Inc Price and EPS SurpriseAcuity Brands Inc price-eps-surprise | Acuity Brands Inc Quote Factors to NoteThe focus on product vitality and service levels, strong contributions from both of its segments, along with renovation projects and benefits from the OPTOTRONIC business acquisition, are likely to have contributed to Acuity Brands' growth in third-quarter fiscal 2023.The company has gained from its strength in the go-to-market channels and its product portfolio. It has focused on investing in product development. The company has also introduced lighting and control products and evolved certain product and solutions portfolio parts. These products use fewer inputs and are highly mobile. Some of the products are globally sourced, while others are manufactured in the company’s facilities to mitigate the supply-chain complexity, thereby helping to improve margins.However, higher raw material and freight costs are likely to have put some pressure on its fiscal third-quarter margins. Again, slowing housing demand, project delays and more competitive pricing are likely to have added headwinds.Story continuesWhat Our Model IndicatesOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Acuity Brands this time around.

This calls for investing in solid insurance companies such as Unum Group, MGIC Investment and Radian Group for sturdy returns.Powell’s Hawkish RemarksJerome Powell recently reiterated the need for increasing interest rates this year, even after the central bank kept rates unchanged in its policy meeting this month. This is because rate hikes are required to curb inflation, which still remains above the Fed’s desired goal of 2%.The Fed’s favored inflation index, the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price gauge, had jumped 4.7% in April from the year-ago levels, added the Commerce Department. Similarly, the consumer price index (CPI) climbed 4% year over year in May, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Insurers to GainAn increasing interest rate environment acts as a boon for insurance companies. This is because an insurance company generates investment income from investing premiums that they derive from policyholders in the form of government and corporate bonds.Notably, when interest rates increase, the yields on these bonds rise, helping the insurer to invest the premiums at a higher yield and generate more investment income.Story continues3 Solid ChoicesWith interest rate hikes impending and expected to boost the profit margins of insurers or any company affiliated with the insurance industry, it’s prudent to invest in their stocks for solid gains. We have, thus, selected three such stocks that flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Unum Group is known for providing long-term care insurance, disability insurance, and life insurance, to name a few. Unum has been able to provide solid benefits coupled with conservative pricing, which in due course has helped the company register strong sales.Thanks to improving premium income and growth in products, UNM shares are well-poised to scale upward shortly. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 20.6%.Unum’s estimated earnings growth rate for the next five-year period is 8.4%. Its shares have already gained 6.8% over the past five years. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 10.6% over the past 60 days. UNM, currently, sports a Zacks Rank #1.MGIC Investment is one of the primary mortgage insurers in the United States.

11,ac11fed4-0d99-3928-a852-39a02a4f2f5f,TMO,2023-06-28,Is Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) A Risky Investment?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thermo-fisher-scientific-nyse-tmo-110018961.html,1687950018,STORY,['TMO'],"[Warren Buffett famously said, 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. We can see that Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) does use debt in its business. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?When Is Debt Dangerous?Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together. See our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific How Much Debt Does Thermo Fisher Scientific Carry?As you can see below, at the end of April 2023, Thermo Fisher Scientific had US$35.1b of debt, up from US$33.1b a year ago. Click the image for more detail. However, it also had US$3.48b in cash, and so its net debt is US$31.6b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Healthy Is Thermo Fisher Scientific's Balance Sheet?The latest balance sheet data shows that Thermo Fisher Scientific had liabilities of US$15.9b due within a year, and liabilities of US$36.3b falling due after that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$3.48b as well as receivables valued at US$9.30b due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$39.4b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.While this might seem like a lot, it is not so bad since Thermo Fisher Scientific has a huge market capitalization of US$196.6b, and so it could probably strengthen its balance sheet by raising capital if it needed to. But it's clear that we should definitely closely examine whether it can manage its debt without dilution.Story continuesWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.Thermo Fisher Scientific's net debt is 2.9 times its EBITDA, which is a significant but still reasonable amount of leverage. However, its interest coverage of 15.6 is very high, suggesting that the interest expense on the debt is currently quite low. Shareholders should be aware that Thermo Fisher Scientific's EBIT was down 26% last year. If that earnings trend continues then paying off its debt will be about as easy as herding cats on to a roller coaster. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Thermo Fisher Scientific's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, Thermo Fisher Scientific recorded free cash flow worth 75% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.Our ViewBased on what we've seen Thermo Fisher Scientific is not finding it easy, given its EBIT growth rate, but the other factors we considered give us cause to be optimistic. In particular, we are dazzled with its interest cover. When we consider all the factors mentioned above, we do feel a bit cautious about Thermo Fisher Scientific's use of debt. While debt does have its upside in higher potential returns, we think shareholders should definitely consider how debt levels might make the stock more risky. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Thermo Fisher Scientific .When all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

That is because the Aug 18, 2023 $45.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Edwards Lifesciences' shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Edwards Lifesciences is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in the Medical - Instruments industry that ranks in the Top 45% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, 10 analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 62 cents per share to 65 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Edwards Lifesciences right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

Fifty-five percent said they ordered groceries online from Amazon Fresh or through Amazon’s website, while under 14% said they ordered from Whole Foods at least once, an Amazon-owned supermarket chain.Sujeet Naik, an analyst at Coresight, says Walmart’s growth in popularity among Prime members comes as the retailer expands its online grocery offerings. Naik told Business Insider that the retailer is opening new fulfillment centers and offers free grocery delivery for members of its subscription program, Walmart+.Earlier this year, Amazon began charging delivery fees for Fresh grocery orders under $150, GOBankingRates reported at the time. Previously, Prime shoppers enjoyed free delivery if they ordered at least $35 worth of items. Walmart+ subscribers still receive free delivery on groceries of at least $35.CNBC Select compared Amazon Prime and Walmart+ and found that while both offer a 30-day free trial, Amazon’s monthly cost is $14.99 versus $12.95 per month for Walmart+.

19,0d41687b-b851-32dd-b591-836ba31c2bc9,WMT,2023-06-28,Is It Worth Investing in Walmart (WMT) Based on Wall Street's Bullish Views?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/worth-investing-walmart-wmt-based-133006791.html,1687872606,STORY,['WMT'],"[The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Walmart (WMT) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Walmart currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.53, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 29 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.53 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 29 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 19 are Strong Buy and four are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 65.5% and 13.8% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for WMTBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for WMTCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Walmart here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Walmart, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is WMT Worth Investing In?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Walmart, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0% over the past month to $6.21.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Walmart. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Walmart may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Major stock indexes suffered a huge blow last year. However, the Dow suffered the least.In 2022, the Dow fell 8.8% year over year, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite plummeted 19.4% and 33.1%, respectively. Last year, the Fed raised the benchmark interest rate by 4.25% to combat 40-year high inflation.A higher interest rate is detrimental to growth stocks like consumer discretionary and technology. In contrast to the Nasdaq Composite and the S&amp;P 500 indexes, the 30-stock Dow is more inclined to cyclical stocks than growth stocks. Therefore, the index suffered the least. However, the situation has taken a turn in 2023.Dow Changes Course in 2023Several economic data have pointed out that the U.S. economy has been cooling since the beginning of 2023. The inflation rate has dropped to a good extent despite remaining elevated in absolute terms.Consequently, the Fed reduced the magnitude of interest rate hike in 2023. In the June FOMC meeting, the Fed paused the rate hike for the first time after 10 consecutive increases. However, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell warned that more rate raises are expected by the end of this year.A lower rate hike has enabled growth sector like technology, communication services and consumer discretionary to thrive this year. Consequently, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has jumped 28.9% year to date. The broad-market S&amp;P 500 Index has also seen a decent rally of 13.3%. However, the Dow is up a mere 1.8% so far this year.Our Top PicksDefying a tepid Dow, we have narrowed our search to five blue-chip (components of Dow) stocks with strong potential for 2023. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Story continuesThe chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past three months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCaterpillar Inc. CAT has seen year-over-year revenue and earnings growth for nine straight quarters thanks to its cost-saving actions, strong end-market demand and pricing actions that offset the impact of supply-chain snarls and cost pressures. We expect the company’s adjusted earnings per share for 2023 to grow 19% and revenues to rise 7%.The Construction Industries segment of CAT is expected to benefit from the rising construction activities in the United States and other parts of the world. Backed by demand for commodities fueled by the energy-transition trend, a thriving mining sector will aid the Resource Industries segment. Caterpillar’s dividend yield and payout ratio are higher than its peers. A strong liquidity position, investments in expanding services and digital initiatives should help CAT deliver outsized returns.Zacks Rank #1 Caterpillar has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 10% and 28.3%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last seven days.salesforce.com inc. CRM is benefiting from a robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. The rapid adoption of its cloud-based solutions is driving demand for CRM’s products. CRM’s sustained focus on introducing more aligned products as per customer needs is driving its top-line.Continued deal wins in the international market are the other growth drivers. The acquisition of Slack would position salesforce.com as a leader in the enterprise team collaboration solution space and help it compete better with Microsoft’s Teams product. We expect CRM revenues to witness a CAGR of 12.5% during fiscal 2023-2025.Zacks Rank #2 salesforce.com has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 10.5% and 42%, respectively, for the current year (January 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.6% over the last 30 days.McDonald's Corp. MCD continues to impress investors with robust comps growth. MCD’s increased focus on menu innovation and loyalty program expansion is commendable. MCD is also undertaking every effort to drive growth in international markets. Robust digitalization is likely to help McDonald's in driving long-term growth and capture market share. MCD plans to open more than 1,900 restaurants globally in 2023.Zacks Rank #2 McDonald’s has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 7.7% and 9.4%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last 30 days.The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. PG has benefitted from robust pricing and a favorable mix, along with strength across segments. PG’s products play a key role in meeting the daily health, hygiene and cleaning needs of consumers around the world. PG has witnessed continued strong momentum as reflected by the underlying strength in brands and appropriate strategies, which aided its organic sales growth.Procter &amp; Gamble remains focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. PG’s continued investment in the business alongside its efforts to offset macro cost headwinds and balance top and bottom-line growth underscores its productivity efforts. PG is witnessing cost savings and efficiency improvements across all facets of the business.Zacks Rank #2 Procter &amp; Gamble has an expected earnings growth rate of 4.5% and 8.3%, respectively, for the next fiscal year (June 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next fiscal year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last 30 days.Walmart Inc. WMT has been benefiting from its robust omnichannel operations due to its efforts to enhance both store and online experience. WMT has been particularly gaining from its efforts to boost delivery services. WMT’s U.S. comp sales continued gaining from an increased market share in grocery in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.Zacks Rank #2 Walmart has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 4.5% for the current year and earnings growth rate of 10.5% for next year.

(CVE:SNM) may be sending bullish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all the Oil and Gas companies in Canada have P/S ratios greater than 1.6x and even P/S higher than 7x are not unusual. However, the P/S might be low for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified. Check out our latest analysis for ShaMaran Petroleum ps-multiple-vs-industryHow Has ShaMaran Petroleum Performed Recently?There hasn't been much to differentiate ShaMaran Petroleum's and the industry's revenue growth lately. It might be that many expect the mediocre revenue performance to degrade, which has repressed the P/S ratio. Those who are bullish on ShaMaran Petroleum will be hoping that this isn't the case.Want the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on ShaMaran Petroleum will help you uncover what's on the horizon.Is There Any Revenue Growth Forecasted For ShaMaran Petroleum?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/S as low as ShaMaran Petroleum's is when the company's growth is on track to lag the industry.Retrospectively, the last year delivered an exceptional 50% gain to the company's top line. Pleasingly, revenue has also lifted 132% in aggregate from three years ago, thanks to the last 12 months of growth. Accordingly, shareholders would have definitely welcomed those medium-term rates of revenue growth.Looking ahead now, revenue is anticipated to remain buoyant, climbing by 57% during the coming year according to the lone analyst following the company. Meanwhile, the broader industry is forecast to contract by 5.3%, which would indicate the company is doing very well.With this in mind, we find it intriguing that ShaMaran Petroleum's P/S falls short of its industry peers. Apparently some shareholders are doubtful of the contrarian forecasts and have been accepting significantly lower selling prices.Story continuesThe Final WordWhile the price-to-sales ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of revenue expectations.Our examination of ShaMaran Petroleum's analyst forecasts revealed that its superior revenue outlook against a shaky industry isn't contributing to its P/S anywhere near as much as we would have predicted. When we see a superior revenue outlook with some actual growth, we can only assume investor uncertainty is what's been suppressing the P/S figures. One major risk is whether its revenue trajectory can keep outperforming under these tough industry conditions. It appears many are indeed anticipating revenue instability, because the company's current prospects should normally provide a boost to the share price.And what about other risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted   4 warning signs for ShaMaran Petroleum   (of which 2 are a bit unpleasant!) you should know about.If you're unsure about the strength of ShaMaran Petroleum's business, why not explore our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals for some other companies you may have missed.Have feedback on this article?

On Monday it had slumped to 87.23, its weakest point since late March 2022.The rouble lost 1% to trade at 94.20 versus the euro and was 0.5% weaker against the yuan at 11.85 .Capital controls have helped insulate the rouble against geopolitics to a certain extent in the 16 months since Russia invaded Ukraine, but Yevgeny Prigozhin's march on Moscow reverberated through markets and left questions about President Vladimir Putin's grip on power.Market players are likely to remain cautious, analysts said, while today's passing of a month-end tax period that typically sees exporters convert foreign currency revenues to meet local liabilities will dent the rouble's support.As the peak of the tax period passes, the rouble will begin to fall in price, said Alor Broker in a note, considering 89-90 roubles per dollar as a target range.""Last weekend's events, we are sure, were unexpected for many investors and rekindled the question of whether the current risk premium for investing in Russian assets is acceptable,"" said Dmitry Polevoy, head of investment at Locko-Invest.Polevoy said his forecast of the rouble strengthening to around 74-76 against the dollar before ending the year near 80, now looked less likely.Brent crude oil, a global benchmark for Russia's main export, was up 0.2% at $72.40 a barrel.Russian stock indexes were lower.The dollar-denominated RTS index was down 1.2% to 1,015.7 points. The rouble-based MOEX Russian index was unchanged at 2,776.0 points.Shares in retailer Magnit were outperforming, around 1.8% higher after the sources told Reuters the company may roughly double the number of blocked shares it buys back after seeing strong demand from Western investors keen to exit Russian holdings.

However, Norway has fended off accusations that it’s profiting from the war in Ukraine.In February, the Storting, the Norwegian parliament, announced that the Scandinavian country is donating 75 billion kroner ($7.4 billion) to Kyiv as part of a five-year support package, making Norway one of the world’s biggest donors to war-torn Ukraine.

Both contracts sank nearly 7% each, or about $5, in the past five sessions.U.S. inventories seen shrinking as summer demand heats upIn some positive cues for oil markets, data from the American Petroleum Institute (API) showed that U.S. oil inventories shrank by a bigger-than-expected 2.4 million barrels in the week to June 23, much more than expectations for a draw of 1.47 million barrels.A sharp drop in gasoline inventories pointed to improving fuel demand in the world’s largest oil consumer, amid the travel-heavy summer season.The API data usually heralds a similar trend in inventory readings from the Energy Information Administration, due later on Wednesday. A drop in inventories points to some tightening in U.S. supplies, especially as near-term demand improves.The data also comes after a clash between Russia and the mercenary group Wagner fueled some concerns over renewed disruptions in global oil supplies, although the clash appeared to be short-lived.Interest rate fears persist ahead of Powell, Lagarde speechesBut despite some signs of tightening supplies, oil prices were nursing steep losses on fears of rising interest rates in the U.S. and Europe.Central Bank leaders Jerome Powell and Christine Lagarde are set to speak at a European Central Bank forum later in the day, and are both expected to offer a hawkish outlook on interest rates.Story continuesPowell had already warned last week that the Federal Reserve could hike interest rates at least two more times this year, while Lagarde also flagged more rate hikes on Tuesday.The prospect of rising interest rates, coupled with worsening economic conditions across the globe, have weighed heavily on oil prices this year, despite repeated production cuts in Saudi Arabia and tightening supplies.Data on Wednesday also showed that Chinese industrial profits continued to decline this year, raising concerns over weak fuel demand in the world’s largest oil importer.Related ArticlesOil steadies as U.S. inventories shrink, Powell speech awaitedNASA sees moon lunar mining trial within the next decadePanama pledges to purge more substandard ships from world's largest registry]"

This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Salesforce.com is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.For Salesforce.com, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for Salesforce.comThis customer-management software developer is expected to earn $7.44 per share for the fiscal year ending January 2024, which represents a year-over-year change of 42%.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Salesforce.com. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 7.8%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Salesforce.com to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(CRM) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-salesforce-inc-130013144.html,1687870813,STORY,['CRM'],"[Salesforce.com (CRM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this customer-management software developer have returned -3.8%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Salesforce.com falls in, has gained 0.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Salesforce.com is expected to post earnings of $1.90 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +59.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +17.6%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.44 points to a change of +42% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +7.8%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.99 indicates a change of +20.9% from what Salesforce.com is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.6%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Salesforce.com.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Salesforce.com, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $8.52 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +10.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $34.63 billion and $38.47 billion estimates indicate +10.5% and +11.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySalesforce.com reported revenues of $8.25 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.3%. EPS of $1.69 for the same period compares with $0.98 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.17 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.95%. The EPS surprise was +4.97%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Salesforce.com is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Salesforce.com. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Though the operating backdrop hasn’t improved much, green shoots are visible. Further, its ongoing cost-efficiency efforts will aid the bottom line.Moody’s is witnessing upward earnings estimate revisions, reflecting analysts’ optimism regarding its earnings growth potential. In the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has moved marginally and 1% upward for 2023 and 2024, respectively. MCO currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).So far this year, shares of Moody’s have rallied 20.1%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 4.1%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhy MCO Stock is an Attractive Investment OptionRevenue Strength: Moody’s remains focused on enhancing revenue growth. The company has increased exposure to the banking and insurance industry, and is diversifying into the emerging and fast-growing professional services and ERS businesses. A rising share of the analytics business, which is not correlated with the volatility of interest rates, has added stability to top-line growth.Though revenues declined in 2022 because of weakness in bond issuance volumes, the same witnessed a four-year (2018-2022) CAGR of 5.3%. Given the improved mix and lower-risk nature of the company’s product portfolio, the top line is expected to rise. Moody’s is currently focused on investing in technology platforms and processes to boost operations.The consensus estimate for sales indicates growth of 7.2% and 10.2% for 2023 and 2024, respectively.Moody’s projects revenues to increase in the mid-to-high-single-digit percent range for 2023.Synergies From Acquisitions: Moody’s growth has been reflected in several successful acquisitions over the past few years. In December 2022, it announced a deal to acquire SCRiesgo, which will bolster its presence in Central America and the Dominican Republic. In March 2022, in a bid to strengthen its Know Your Customer capabilities, the company purchased 360kompany AG, while in December 2021, it acquired PassFort Limited.These strategic deals have provided MCO with increased scale and cross-selling opportunities across products and vertical markets.

Further, the company’s earnings are projected to grow 14.4% in 2023 and 13.4% in 2024.Moody’s now expects 2023 adjusted earnings in the range of $9.50-$10.00 per share, up from the earlier projection of $9.00-$9.50. On a GAAP basis, this year's earnings are projected within $8.45-$8.95 per share, rising from the prior target of $8.05-$8.55.Further, its long-term (three to five years) estimated earnings growth rate of 11.3% promises rewards for investors in the long run.Also, the stock has a Growth Score of B. Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2, offer the best upside potential.Story continuesGeolocation Restructuring Program: Amid a challenging operating backdrop, Moody’s is undertaking efforts to maintain profitability. The restructuring plan will accelerate a number of ongoing cost-efficiency initiatives and includes real estate optimization and increased utilization of lower-cost operational hubs.The program is expected to result in annualized savings of $100-$135 million annually. The exit from certain leased office spaces is likely to result in $50-$70 million of pre-tax charges to either terminate or sublease the affected real estate leases.The program also comprises $75-$100 million of pre-tax personnel-related restructuring charges, including severance and related costs primarily determined under MCO’s existing severance plans.Cash outlays associated with the program are expected to be $75-$100 million, which are expected to be paid through 2024. The program is likely to be substantially complete by the end of this year.Strong Balance Sheet: Moody’s diversifying efforts are well supported by a strong balance sheet position.

The research finds that newlyweds would rather gift-givers skip traditional presents in favor of financial gifts toward the purchase of a home, but many feel obligated to register for traditional gifts they don't want.Among those surveyed who have created a wedding registry in the last 24 months, 85% say they would have preferred to have received money toward a down payment on a home, rather than a physical gift. If they could do it again differently, they would – 80% say that if they were creating a gift registry today, they would include an option for people to gift them money toward home buying expenses, such as a down payment, a mortgage payment or closing costs.But despite the desire for financial gifts to be used toward a home purchase, both newlyweds and gift givers are stuck in a traditional gift-giving cycle.People are registering for – and giving – gifts they don't want out of obligationEighty-two percent of those surveyed who've recently created a wedding registry say they felt obligated to register for traditional gifts, such as home furnishings, dishware, etc., with 53% saying they felt very obligated to register for traditional gifts.This is causing most (88%) of those surveyed who've recently created a wedding registry to register for gifts they didn't really want:46% registered for gifts they didn't want because they felt obligated to have traditional gifts on their registry40% registered for gifts they didn't want because their fiancé/spouse wanted them35% registered for gifts they didn't want, but planned to return them for money to use on what they really wantStory continuesThe obligation to traditional gifting goes both ways:80% of those who've recently created a wedding registry say they've felt obligated to buy a traditional gift for a wedding they attended70% say they would prefer to buy a traditional gift for a wedding they attendTimes, they are-a-changinSeventy-two percent of those surveyed who've recently created a wedding registry included options on their registry for people to contribute financially to a specific large-ticket item, such as a honeymoon, and 22% said they didn't include this option, but would have liked to.This corresponds with more people being willing to give money toward home buying as a gift at weddings they attend, with 30% of those surveyed now being open to giving such gifts:16% would prefer to gift money toward a home down payment14% have no preference between a traditional gift and money toward home buying expenses""Over the last few years, homebuyers have been facing a number of challenges, most notably around affordability due to high home prices and mortgage rates,"" said Clare Trapasso, executive news editor at Realtor.com®. ""We're seeing buyers get creative with how they cobble together the necessary financials, from tapping into down payment assistance programs, to asking for help from family and friends. Adding a home buying gift option to a wedding registry is a great way for people to crowd-source these often hard-to-come-by funds. It allows their loved ones to celebrate one of the biggest moments of their lives while helping them to achieve homeownership.""With mortgage rates expected to remain elevated, putting pressure on buyers' budgets at least through the end of this year, coupled with continued low for-sale inventory, competition for housing will remain strong and buyers will need to continue getting creative to afford to buy this year.Survey MethodologyThe research was conducted by Censuswide, with 2,291 respondents in the U.S. including 755 people who have created a wedding registry in the last 24 months.

54,1d78ca1f-a248-3e91-ba45-8484e83ba5f1,MRO,2023-06-28,Those who invested in Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) three years ago are up 287%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/those-invested-marathon-oil-nyse-181246416.html,1687889566,STORY,['MRO'],"[It might seem bad, but the worst that can happen when you buy a stock (without leverage) is that its share price goes to zero. But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. To wit, the Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) share price has flown 272% in the last three years. That sort of return is as solid as granite. It's down 2.9% in the last seven days.Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. View our latest analysis for Marathon Oil To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Marathon Oil was able to grow its EPS at 139% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. This EPS growth is higher than the 55% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has moderated its expectations for growth, somewhat. We'd venture the lowish P/E ratio of 5.02 also reflects the negative sentiment around the stock.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how Marathon Oil has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Marathon Oil the TSR over the last 3 years was 287%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveMarathon Oil shareholders are down 2.8% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 11%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 3% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks, for example - Marathon Oil has   3 warning signs  (and 1 which is concerning)  we think you should know about.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of companies we expect will grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

My name is Rob, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Walgreens Boots Alliance Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Tiffany Kanaga, Vice President of Global Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.Tiffany Ann KanagaGood morning. Thank you for joining us for the Walgreens Boots Alliance Earnings Call for the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. I'm Tiffany Kanaga, Vice President of Global Investor Relations. Joining me on today's call are Roz Brewer, our Chief Executive Officer; James Kehoe, our Chief Financial Officer; and John Driscoll, President of U.S. Healthcare; Rick Gates, Senior Vice President and Chief Pharmacy Officer at Walgreens, will participate in Q&amp;A. All references to the COVID-19 headwind on today's call include U.S. vaccines, drive-through tests and OTC tests. As always, during the conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 2 and those outlined on our latest forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement after this presentation, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise. You can find our press release and the slides referenced on this call in the Investors section of the Walgreens Boots Alliance website. The slides and the press release also contain further information about the non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss during this call. I will now turn the call over to Roz.Story continuesRosalind Gates BrewerThanks, Tiffany, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start today's call with an acknowledgment that our performance in the third quarter did not meet our overall expectations, and we are disappointed to have to change our fiscal 2023 guidance. While we achieved good sales growth and return to adjusted earnings growth in the quarter, several dynamics created margin pressures that we are factoring into our full year outlook. We have seen changing market trends that have consumers prioritizing value in response to a more uncertain and challenging economic environment. There has been a steeper drop off in COVID vaccines and testing with the end of the public health emergency. We are also experiencing a slower profit ramp for U.S. health care. Importantly, we remain committed to our strategy through immediate actions to accelerate our path to profitability and unlock long-term value. I remain confident in the long-term trajectory of our transformation, which is underpinned by significant progress against each of our 4 strategic priorities. We are continuing to transform and align our core business with advancements in our tech-enabled pharmacy operating model. Today, we are announcing a scalable partnership with TelePharm to expand telepharmacy services, improve access to care, and provide flexibility for how and when patients engage with our pharmacists. Our model is also supported by our micro fulfillment centers, covering over 40% of our Walgreens store footprint. In U.S. retail, our flat year-to-date comp sales have successfully lapped last year's record 8.8% growth, and retail gross margin is up over 100 basis points, yet again. We have also made significant progress on building our next growth engine in health care, rapidly establishing our portfolio of assets across the care continuum. VillageMD acquired Summit to create a leading independent care delivery platform, and we accelerated the full acquisition of Shield and CareCentrix. This segment has gone from 0 sales contribution just 2 years ago to a run rate of $8 billion in the third quarter of 2023. To fund our transformation and focus the portfolio, we have realized $4.1 billion in proceeds from the sale of ABC shares this fiscal year and also exited our Option Care Health position for $800 million in proceeds. Finally, we have continued to invest in strategic talent and capabilities, most recently strengthening VillageMD's bench to welcome CFO, Rich Rubino.Turning to the third quarter. WBA returned to adjusted EPS growth up nearly 4%. Third quarter sales were solid, growing almost 9% in constant currency. U.S. comp sales were up 7%. Let me call out U.S. retail digital sales up 19% on top of a 25% gain last year with 3.7 million same-day pickup orders. International was also notable, up 6.9% in the quarter. It is clear that consumers continue to appreciate the value, convenience and range of services delivered by Walgreens and Boots. Our increased expense discipline in the quarter only partly offset outsized margin pressure and earnings growth was held back by 3 external factors. First, we saw lower-than-expected COVID-related demand. We had called out COVID as a wildcard heading into the quarter and have unfortunately seen less patient willingness to vaccinate. Walgreens administered 800,000 COVID-19 vaccines in the quarter, down 83% year-on-year, and testing volumes are also down sharply. We are, in turn, taking a prudent step of further reducing our expectations for COVID contributions going forward. We are currently projecting to administer 9 million to 10 million COVID vaccines next year in line with the typical flu season and compared to 12.5 million COVID vaccines expected in fiscal 2023. Second, and similar to other retailers, we've been impacted by the rapid softening of the macro environment and a more cautious and value-driven consumer. Our customer is feeling the strain of higher inflation and interest rates, lower SNAP benefits and tax refunds and an uncertain economic outlook. They are pulling back on discretionary and seasonal spend and responding strongly to promotional activity. For example, promotional unit growth is running up 10% in the retail channel, including a sharp increase over just a 5-week period while nonpromotional units fell 8%. Let me add that we see the retail pricing environment as remaining rational. We have also seen some pressure on industry script volume, excluding COVID, which may be related to these broader consumer headwinds. Day fall adjusted market growth, excluding immunizations, has slowed almost 2 percentage points from February to May. Our core retail pharmacy business is resilient and relatively well positioned in times of volatile consumer confidence. However, we're not immune to these external pressures and have trimmed our expectations accordingly, while at the same time, ramping up our efforts around cost savings.Third, we've experienced a drag from a recent weaker respiratory season. We are feeling the effects through our script volume through our front of store sales, especially in the higher-margin cough cold flu category and in CityMD's traffic trends. These trends are likely to persist into the fourth quarter against last year's category strength. Importantly, we achieved strong quality of earnings considering a 4.7% adverse net impact to adjusted EPS from COVID, the sell of ABC shares, sell and leaseback, incentive accruals and tax. This strength gives us line of sight to accelerating adjusted operating income growth in the fourth quarter.Let me turn to our updated guidance. We now expect fiscal 2023 adjusted EPS at to $4 to $4.05, reflecting consumer and category trends, lower COVID-19 contribution and a more cautious macroeconomic forward view. This guidance represents core earnings to be flat to up 1%, excluding COVID and currency. We are also providing preliminary fiscal 2024 commentary. Let me be clear, there are some factors impacting us today that are likely to extend into next year, namely the macroeconomic-driven consumer pressure and COVID headwinds. We are closely watching emerging challenges to consumer spending and sentiment such as the end of fiscal stimulus and the resumption of student loan payments. There are other factors that are more specific to our business today and should not be annualized into fiscal 2024, such as the weaker respiratory season. Most importantly, we have undertaken several aggressive initiatives to enhance profitability and cash flow into next year, especially in our health care business. We expect low to mid-single-digit adjusted operating growth in fiscal 2024 with the U.S. retail pharmacy and U.S. health care businesses more than offsetting headwinds from COVID sell and leaseback and ABC. AOI growth should outpace adjusted EPS due to offsets from higher tax and noncontrolling interest. We will provide a more detailed discussion of 2024 guidance when we report fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. The positive operating growth trends with improving quality of earnings support our continued confidence in building to sustainable, long-term, low teens adjusted EPS growth over time. To drive shareholder value, we are taking the following immediate actions to enhance profitability and accelerate our journey. First, we are raising our transformational cost management program savings goal to $4.1 billion. This includes $800 million of savings in fiscal 2024. Second, we have implemented capital and project spend reductions, and we've launched a working capital optimization program. Third, we are pursuing portfolio simplification at an even faster pace. Fourth, we are announcing several specific actions to accelerate U.S. health care's path to profitability, focused on VillageMD and Summit Health. We are also accelerating the synergies between our U.S. Healthcare segment and our core Walgreens business. We have a unique opportunity to improve local health care and well-being in this country. The fly role of health care and retail pharmacy working together will deliver more affordable, accessible quality health care to our communities and will also deliver sustainable shareholder value. It starts with our trusted brand and pharmacists, national footprint and digital offerings. 58% of Americans are likely to visit their local pharmacy as a first step when faced with a nonemergency medical issue. Add to that, our leading assets across the care continuum, VillageMD, Summit, Shield and CareCentrix and our early work with health corners and clinical trials. We've created a platform at scale that is absolutely proving to help health plans and patients improve outcomes and lower cost. Our teams are expanding partnerships and driving greater market access, which is the next step to getting our will to turn. As health care and retail pharmacy jointly serve consumers, we will deepen engagement and reinforce our trusted brand. Let's look at a few tangible examples of how we're driving that value through our integrated portfolio. In partnering with VillageMD, our team-based health care delivery enhances adherence. We are building digital connections and stand-alone clinics. More than 30 in Arizona and Texas are now supported by Walgreens pharmacies virtually with more coming online in Georgia this summer. To make the virtual experience seamless, we're piloting a health care concierge program to provide extra care coordination. We are also exploring an integrated pharmacist ambulatory care model. The pilot has driven over 40% reduction in hospital readmissions over 30 days and a material A1c reduction in diabetic patients. Remember also that roughly 50% of patients had co-located VillageMD clinics opt to get their prescription field at Walgreens. VillageMD co-located sites that have been open for over 2 years continue to drive approximately 40 incremental scripts per site per day. CareCentrix and a leading national health care services provider are partnering to offer a turnkey durable medical equipment benefit management solution and point-of-care platform for health plans. This should drive medical and administrative savings while improving the overall member experience. Shield and Walgreens are working together to establish Walgreens as a single contract pharmacy for health systems. Walgreens is also converting existing specialty pharmacy locations to Shield's partners to increase access to specialty drugs and services. Finally, at Walgreens Health, we are exploring new health care service lines such as additional diagnostic services and data analytics and insights. We've already seen strong results with our at-home testing programs, such as the one we conducted last fall with Blue Shield of California to boost patient access to colorectal cancer screening. Members due for screening had the opportunity to visit Walgreens pharmacy locations across the state to pick up an at-home kit. The test completion rate was 50 percentage points higher when members chose pharmacy pickup compared to those that received the kit in the mail. Based on these successful results, we are launching similar at-home testing programs with other payer partners. In summary, our health care and retail pharmacy businesses are working together to improve outcomes and lower costs as only Walgreens can do. I am not satisfied by today's headline guidance revisions. However, I see the enterprise approach coming together to deliver sustainable value to consumers, to our partners, and to shareholders. We have the right strategy. We are driving good progress across each of our strategic priorities, and we are taking appropriate measures to account for the recent macroeconomic challenges and uncertainty. Through the necessary actions discussed today, we are pushing harder toward profitability with a strong sense of urgency while continuing to reimagine local health care and wellness for all. With that, I'll hand it over to James to provide more color on our results and our outlook.James KehoeThank you, Roz, and good morning. In summary, while we returned to adjusted EPS growth in the third quarter, earnings were below our expectations as we encountered lower COVID contributions, shifting consumer behaviors and a recent slowdown in respiratory incidences. Overall, we delivered 8.9% sales growth on a constant currency basis ahead of our plan, led by our U.S. pharmacy business, up 10%; our Boots U.K. retail business, which delivered a solid 13% comp and our scaling Health Care business, which added $1.4 billion in sales versus the prior year. Adjusted EPS increased 3.6% on a constant currency basis despite a 19 percentage point headwind due to a lower COVID-19 contribution and 8 percentage points from reduced ownership of AmerisourceBergen. These were partly offset by favorabilities from sale and leaseback, incentive accruals and tax. All of these items net out to be a 4.7 percentage point headwind to EPS growth and this demonstrates overall good quality of earnings in the quarter. As Roz discussed, we are lowering our fiscal '23 adjusted EPS guidance to $4 to $4.05. This updated outlook reflects consumer and category trends, a lower contribution from COVID and an overall more cautious forward view given the continued macroeconomic uncertainty. Later, I will provide more color around the key assumptions underpinning our revised guidance. But first, let's look at the third quarter results in more detail. Adjusted operating income increased 0.6% on a constant currency basis. This included a 22 percentage point headwind from COVID-19 and a 7% drag from reduced AmerisourceBergen ownership, partly offset by sale and leaseback gains and incentive accruals. All of these items net out to an approximately 6% headwind to AOI growth. GAAP net earnings of $118 million declined $171 million compared to prior year. The current quarter included a $323 million after-tax impairment charge related to pharmacy licenses in the U.K. Adjusted net earnings increased 3.4% on a constant currency basis to $860 million. Now let's move to the year-to-date highlights. Year-to-date sales increased 4.8% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EPS was down 20.7%, reflecting a lower COVID 19 contribution of 20 percentage points and reduced the AmerisourceBergen ownership of 3 percentage points. GAAP earnings were a loss of $2.9 billion compared to net earnings of $4.8 billion in 2022. With the current year including a $5.5 billion after-tax charge for opioid-related claims and lawsuits. Now let's move to the U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment. Sales increased 4.4% in the quarter with comp sales up 7%. Adjusted gross profit declined 3.2% year-on-year, reflecting a 5 percentage point negative impact from COVID-19. A 5% reduction in SG&amp;A expense more than offset the gross profit decline and led to AOI growth of 8.4% before the inclusion of AmerisourceBergen equity income. The sell-down of our ABC stake led to a slight AOI decline of 0.4%. Let me now turn to U.S. pharmacy. Pharmacy sales increased 6.3% and advanced 9.8% on a comparable basis, driven by both script growth and brand inflation. Excluding immunizations, comp scripts grew 2.8%, a slight deceleration from the prior quarter and reflecting broader prescription market trends. As expected, adjusted gross profit declined year-on-year, although excluding COVID, gross profit increased as script growth and lower cost of goods sold more than offset reimbursement pressure. Turning next to our U.S. retail business. Following several quarters of very good performance, the retail business encountered some headwinds in the third quarter as the consumer navigated through a difficult macroeconomic backdrop. Excluding tobacco, comp sales grew 0.2%, held back by 90 basis points due to holiday seasonal weakness as consumers pulled back on discretionary spending and 80 basis points due to lower sales of COVID-19 OTC test kits. We saw solid growth in grocery and household, up 4.7% and Beauty up 3.7%. Cough, cold flu sales were flat, but slowed significantly in May due to a decline in respiratory incidences. IQVIA FAN data shows flu, cold and respiratory activity, down 8% in the third quarter versus a 15% increase in the second quarter, with May down in the mid-20% range. Following several consecutive quarters of year-on-year margin expansion, retail gross margin came under modest pressure in the third quarter. We've seen similar trends as the broader market with our promotional units up around 7% in the most recent 13-week period. However, on a year-to-date basis, gross margin has increased by more than 100 basis points, driven by effective margin management. Turning next to the International segment. And as always, I'll talk to constant currency numbers. The International segment continues to perform very well. Sales increased 7% with good growth across all international markets, Boots U.K. was up 10% and Germany wholesale grew 4%. Adjusted operating income of $208 million increased 21% despite a $40 million year-on-year headwind from sale and leaseback transactions. Let's now look in more detail at Boots U.K. Boots U.K. sales advanced 10%, pharmacy comp sales increased 6%, and comp retail sales grew 13%, and this comes on top of a 24% comp in the same quarter last year. Boots grew market share for the ninth consecutive quarter with gains across all categories. We successfully launched Future Renew, a range of innovative new skin care with very positive consumer response. This product line was recently launched in Walgreens. Boots.com sales grew 25% year-on-year and have more than doubled versus the equivalent pre COVID quarter. Over 14% of our U.K. retail sales now comes from boots.com. Turning next to U.S. health care. The U.S. health care business continues to rapidly scale with sales reaching $2 billion, more than doubling from the prior year. Pro forma sales growth was 22%. VillageMD sales were $1.5 billion, up 22% on a pro forma basis. Legacy VillageMD growth was driven by expansion of the clinic footprint with an additional 93 clinics opened in the past year and the ongoing maturation of existing clinics. Summit Health was, however, impacted by a weaker respiratory season that led to fewer CityMD visits and fewer referrals across the Summit Health network. Shields delivered another strong quarter, up 35% and driven by contract wins, including the addition of 6 new health system partners and further expansion of existing partnerships. CareCentrix sales were approximately $360 million with pro forma sales growth of 15%. Adjusted EBITDA reflects weaker-than-expected results at VillageMD and Summit Health, partly offset by continued growth at Shields. CityMD has been impacted by lower visit volume, whereas the VillageMD EBITDA loss reflects new clinic expansions. We anticipate improvement in the fourth quarter as we build patient panels and traffic and align the cost profile with sales. Let's now look at some of the key metrics for the U.S. health care business. VillageMD managed 850,000 value-based lives at quarter end, reflecting year-over-year growth of approximately 27% in the Legacy VillageMD business and the addition of 309,000 value-based lives from Summit. Total value-based lives include 179,000 full risk lives. Our clinical trials business continues to expand with 8 contracts signed and a robust pipeline. Turning next to cash flow. We generated $1.2 billion of operating cash flow with free cash flow of $116 million. The year-over-year decline reflected lower earnings due to COVID-19, a lower contribution from working capital and increased capital expenditures related to growth initiatives. Looking ahead, we are reprioritizing capital projects to reduce planned spend and are rolling out a comprehensive set of working capital optimization initiatives to enhance our cash generation. Turning now to guidance. We are updating our full year '23 adjusted EPS guidance to $4 to $4.05, a constant currency decline of around 20%. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 and ForEx, core adjusted EPS is flat to up 1%. The EPS contribution from COVID-19 is $0.23 lower than our original assumptions at the start of the year. At the beginning of the fiscal year, we expected 16 million vaccinations. And despite the spring booster recommendation, we have reduced our full year expectations to 12.5 million vaccinations. COVID testing has decelerated at an even faster pace. Additionally, we have incorporated the impacts of a more cautious consumer outlook leading to a $0.20 to $0.25 impact as we realign our fourth quarter sales and margin goals to reflect recent trends. Finally, while reducing our ownership stake in AmerisourceBergen has improved our debt position, it has, however, led to a $0.05 headwind. Let me now walk you through our assumptions for each of our business segments. Starting with U.S. retail pharmacy. We now project sales of around $110 billion, up low single digits year-on-year. AOI is projected at $3.8 billion to $3.9 billion, a decline of 22% to 24%, reflecting a 23 percentage point headwind from COVID-19 and 3 percentage points from our reduced ownership stake in AmerisourceBergen. Excluding these 2 impacts, AOI growth is up 2% to 4%. Turning next to the International segment, which is performing well this year. Sales are projected to grow 6% to 8% on a constant currency basis, reflecting strong execution, especially in the U.K. Adjusted operating income of around $900 million represents constant currency growth of approximately 30%. This performance is towards the top end of our original expectations. Our revised outlook for U.S. health care reflects lower visits at CityMD, the continued ramp-up of new VillageMD sites and the slower integration of prior acquisitions into Summit's multi-specialty business. We expect sales of $6.3 billion to $6.8 billion, an increase of $4.8 billion versus prior year and growing approximately 25% on a pro forma basis. We are projecting an adjusted EBITDA loss of $340 million to $380 million, including the factors I mentioned earlier. While the profit performance so far this year has been below plan, rapid correction actions are underway and we expect to drive sequential adjusted EBITDA improvement in the fourth quarter and beyond. Turning now to our corporate assumptions. Our full year tax rate is now expected to be around 12%, and this basically reflects the favorability we have seen so far in fiscal '23, with some of the benefits reversing in the fourth quarter. More specifically, we expect the fourth quarter tax rate of around 23%. Full year guidance of $4 to $4.05 implies fourth quarter EPS of approximately $0.70 to $0.75. The result is weighed down by a much higher average tax rate, and the fourth quarter typically is the lowest quarter of the year. As such, it would be incorrect to extrapolate the quarter as a proxy for 2024. First, normalizing for the tax rate would result in an additional $0.08 in the quarter. Second, seasonality impacts all of our businesses. Looking back over the past 5 years and excluding the impact from COVID-19 and ABC, approximately 20% of our adjusted operating income comes in the fourth quarter. To conclude, adjusting the fourth quarter for tax rate and accounting for seasonality would result in annual adjusted EPS of around $4 per share. Next, I would like to cover the key factors that will influence 2024 performance. Overall, we expect the long-term tailwinds to outweigh the near-term pressures. Some of the challenges we faced in fiscal '23 are expected to continue into '24. We do expect to see some continued weakness in consumer spending, together with moderate increases in labor costs. While reimbursement pressure has eased somewhat over the past 18 months, it is not going away, and we will continue to identify ways to offset the pressure. In addition, we expect lower sale and leaseback activity in fiscal '24, and the tax rate will be higher as we lap a very favorable fiscal '23 performance and higher statutory tax rates are introduced in both the U.K. and Switzerland. However, we have multiple profit drivers and initiatives that will drive sustainable profit growth. Our U.S. health care business will be a significant profit driver, including the first full year of Summit Health, a maturing VillageMD clinic profile and strong actions to accelerate their path to profitability. We expect continued script volume growth and strong contribution from front-of-store initiatives. These include own brand penetration gains and the further expansion of our successful category performance improvement program. Lastly, the transformational cost management program will deliver at least $800 million of savings next year. Next, let's take a deeper look into 2024. We expect fiscal 2024 adjusted operating income to grow low to mid-single digits, led by the U.S. health care segment and solid execution in U.S. retail pharmacy. We are expecting U.S. health care to be the largest driver of total company AOI growth, as the business is rapidly gaining scale, and we will now accelerate the path to profitability. John Driscoll will provide much more color on the immediate actions we are taking to accelerate EBITDA delivery. We expect U.S. retail pharmacy AOI to be flat to down slightly due to lower COVID contributions of approximately $290 million and a $260 million step down in sale and leaseback gains. Absent these items, we anticipate solid core growth, led by transformational cost management program savings and expanding gross profit. Finally, we expect international AOI to decline year-on-year as we lap sizable real estate gains and lose the relatively small AOI contribution from the sale of our business in Chile. Core profit growth will be flat as the business manages through high levels of cost and labor inflation. That being said, our international business is well positioned for long-term success with market share gains and an advantaged and growing e-commerce presence. We do expect AOI growth to outpace EPS due to a higher tax rate and noncontrolling interest. Next, we'll look at U.S. pharmacy in more detail. Excluding COVID, we expect to grow pharmacy gross profit. Underpinning the growth is our differentiated tech-enabled operating model, which frees up capacity for pharmacists to spend more time on clinical programs and supporting our expanding pharmacy service offerings. We are projecting solid script growth benefiting from improved operating hours, increased access to lives and growth in specialty. We are integrating AllianceRx, community-based specialty pharmacies and Shields under a new go-to-market strategy with a payer-agnostic provider-centric approach. In addition, we have launched multiple programs across our pharmacy and U.S. health care business and continue to see engagement from payers and partners for clinical quality initiatives that leverage our integrated assets. Moving now to our U.S. retail business. Gross profit growth will be driven by low single-digit comp growth and continued margin improvement. We are creating significant value through category performance management, where assortment decisions should deliver at least $200 million of savings in fiscal 2024. We are accelerating our own brand penetration through innovation and increased points of distribution and display. Our own brands have margins that are significantly higher than national brands. We are creating more value for consumers as we scale our e-commerce platform and evolve our store formats including a new digital forward store concept and a health and wellness-focused store with favorable early feedback on both concepts. Let me now hand it over to John to discuss our U.S. health care strategy and profit growth drivers.John P. DriscollGood morning. As Roz and James outlined, while we're confident in the range and scale of our health care business, we are disappointed with the pace of our path to profitability. U.S. healthcare missed targets due to VillageMD and CityMD underperformance, directly related to reduced COVID, cold and flu season and softer market demand. We're taking immediate actions to drive improved profitability. We anticipate this year will remain a transition year as we take action to deliver value and drive profitability. We're rightsizing our cost structure through optimizing overhead and revenue synergies to better match market demand. We're raising and accelerating synergy capture goals. We believe that we can enhance Village growth and value by focusing on gaining density in existing markets to accelerate VillageMD's path to profitability and supporting the integration of our digital assets with our VillageMD platform and we continue to enhance our village management team. We've recruited Rich Rubino, a seasoned health care CFO to be the Chief Financial Officer of the combined VillageMD Summit business. Longer term, we're implementing a high-impact, 3-year plan to improve performance through an intense focus on operational excellence and cost optimization. Achieving our health care vision depends on each of our companies, delivering on their respective plans and relentless execution of harvesting growth synergies across the Walgreens portfolio. We're building a differentiated, value-based care delivery model that successfully integrates pharmacy and medical care for a value-based care market that will more than double by 2027. Walgreens has a unique right to win with our reach, consumer engagement and enterprise investments in primary care, specialty and care to the home. We continue to see the enhanced value of our individual health care assets connected to our core Walgreens pharmacy to create value for patients, providers and plans. A great example of that is our quickly scaling clinical trials recruiting business. Next, let me turn to Summit Health, where we see opportunity to drive meaningful AOI in U.S. health care. While we are obviously disappointed with the pace of unlocking the full value of Summit and CityMD, we expect Summit to contribute materially to profit growth in fiscal year '24. Leveraging WBA, we will invest in targeted marketing campaigns to increase the patient base at CityMD sites. Our continued focus on operational excellence and cost optimization should continue to improve growth and synergies from prior acquisitions. Finally, we are raising and accelerating the synergy capture goal from $150 million in 2027 to $200 million in calendar year 2026. Turning to VillageMD. Over the last few months, we've slowed the pace of clinic openings in new markets. As we've studied their performance, we have refocused our growth plans to leverage regional density to support more profitable growth. To achieve our strategic objectives of better engagement and lower cost of care in a more cost-effective manner, we are launching new virtual and asset-light models. We've expanded our marketing efforts to support patient panel growth in our clinics and are working with new leadership to accelerate cost control. We continue to be impressed by the performance of our more mature VillageMD markets risk performance and are focused on continuing to accelerate the conversion of our fee-for-service lives to our proven risk-based model. VillageMD is a high-quality care delivery model. As James mentioned, most of our newer VillageMD clinics are at an early stage of development. But if we focus on the performance of our more mature Medicare Advantage markets, where we've achieved an appropriate level of market density, including Arizona, Georgia and Houston, VillageMD has demonstrated the ability to bend the cost curve. We will focus on replicating this performance in other markets as we convert fee-for-service volume to our risk-based model, and we will also leverage our integrated care models with pharmacy and our other health care assets across the U.S. health care business. As part of our refocused U.S. health care approach, we aligned our go-to-market products for health systems and health plans under one team of seasoned health care executives with some encouraging short-term sales results noted on the slide. In summary, Walgreens remains the independent partner of choice for health plans and health systems through the combination of our legacy pharmacy platform with our portfolio of health assets. Our portfolio consistently delivers better outcomes at lower cost for plans, systems and patients, which we believe is well suited to meet the demands of a health care market that is quickly moving from fee-for-service to fee for value. While there is clearly work to be done, we now have the leadership, plans and organizational structure in place to rapidly advance our priorities. Now let me turn it back over to James.James KehoeThanks, John. Capital allocation priorities remain focused on core business investments, debt paydown and our dividend. We will continue to pursue disciplined returns-based organic investment in our core business, and we are simplifying our portfolio to unlock value and provide financial flexibility. We are very committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating and our dividend. Now let's take a quick look at the transformational cost management program. We are raising the cumulative 2024 savings target to $4.1 billion, and this is the sixth target increase since the program began. With $3.3 billion saved by the end of this year, we are projecting at least $800 million of savings in '24. Let me talk to a couple of the cost-saving initiatives. We just completed an organization restructuring, which included transforming our headquarters to better align our resources with our strategic priorities. This led to the elimination of more than 500 roles, representing around 10% of our corporate and U.S. support office workforce. Our pharmacy of the future operating model will drive significant savings. We are optimizing the model through our micro fulfillment centers, tech-enabled centralization of in-store activities and telepharmacy solutions. These initiatives will also elevate the role of the pharmacist and improve patient engagement. Finally, we will continue to optimize our locations and opening hours and expect to close an additional 300 locations in the U.K. and 150 locations in the U.S. As you have seen, we are accelerating our portfolio optimization to further simplify the business. We have fully exited from our Option Care Health position with overall proceeds of $1.2 billion since August 2022. Let me also highlight our recent monetization of AmerisourceBergen shares using a variable prepaid forward structure. Under the VPF approach, there is no EPS dilution until the contracts mature. We continue to receive dividends and we retain some share price upside. Please note that the remaining stake in AmerisourceBergen is worth approximately $5 billion. With that, let me now pass it back to Roz for her closing comments.Rosalind Gates BrewerThank you, James. Before we kick off Q&amp;A, let me sum up what you've heard. WBA has the right to win through our differentiated model, and we have the right strategy in place. We are now entering the next phase of our health care transformation with aggressive actions in motion to improve profitability. We are addressing current challenges head on and moving at a pace to deliver long-term shareholder value. We have the scale, we have the skill, we have the sense of urgency, and we have the right plans to drive sustainable profit growth ahead. Now I'd like to open the line for questions. Operator?Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan.Lisa Christine GillThanks for all the detail. The first area I just want to focus on is around your U.S. health care business. There is substantial growth as we think about going both into the fourth quarter and then into next year. John commented on the miss by both VillageMD and CityMD around performance, but also talked about utilization. We've heard on the opposite end where managed care is talking about utilization from a negative side, so can you help me to square that, one, when we think about VillageMD and we think about your Medicare Advantage lives and what you're seeing for utilization there. Is that a current headwind? And then secondly, when you think about things like CityMD that's not seeing respiratory or COVID visits, what do you think are the opportunities there? And is that part of the synergy pull forward that you're talking about for the $200 million as we think about 2026?John P. DriscollThanks, Lisa. I think it's -- utilization is actually sort of a mixed blessing for us. We're seeing consistently solid performance in terms of bending the cost curve at Village, and I think that positions us better and better as a managed care partner. We were hit with the CityMD utilization. I think that we're at the early stages of harvesting the embedded profitability of Summit and City. And the City hit on utilization in this quarter also hit our lab and ancillary business a bit, but we think that there's an opportunity on both the value-based side to integrate some of the lessons from Village at Summit and City because both of them have very high NPS. They are demonstrating the ability to reduce cost over time. And as we get at some of the cost synergies, I think you're going to see a significant improvement. I mean we are expecting a quarter-over-quarter improvement in health care EBITDA of 70% looking at Q4. So I think we've got opportunities on the cost side, but also on the value side to optimize our model.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank.George Robert HillJames, I guess a couple targeted at you. With OCF earnings below the dividend through 3 quarters, and there's lots of moving pieces that OP not expected to grow meaningfully next year. And we know there's the cash for ACA. I guess. So can you talk about, a, how the company is thinking about the dividend; and b, as it relates to Rx reimbursement pressure, I guess, can you talk about what the early expectations are for calendar '24? And are we expecting kind of the leg down in pharmacy reimbursement pressure to look like prior years?James KehoeLet me cover dividend first. And just I want to emphasize in '24, we are giving commentary that operating income will grow low to mid-single digit. We clearly have a lot of work to do on cash flow, and first one is EBITDA, so we see strong growth next year. And the second one is we're building out incremental working capital programs and we're significantly curtailing our capital expenditures. So I want to make it crystal clear, we are absolutely committed to the dividend, absolutely committed both to the dividend and/or investment-grade rating. And I would point out, we did highlight specifically in the prepared comments that our stake in ABC is still worth $5 billion. So we -- while we're going through the short-term transformation, we do have plenty of firepower going forward. Bear in mind, as you look at our numbers on cash flow, we're investing approximately $1 billion of free cash flow in health care this year. And as we move forward into the future, and it starts breaking even on an EBITDA basis, that $1 billion quickly becomes a cash flow generation, too. But we are getting into incremental and much more aggressive actions on capital and working capital in the short term. Your second question then was on calendar '24. The reimbursement -- okay, sorry about that. Reimbursement, as looking back over the last 18 months, the environment has been much more positive. I would say that we did comment and we've actually come in similar to that. We said that this year, the current fiscal year is an 85%. I saw a 15% step down on the previous year, so that is the net reimbursement pressure on the P&amp;L has improved. We actually don't want to give too much comments on future negotiations, but we see much more productive discussions with payers and providers in general, because we're bringing more value to the table, our ability to do medical adherence and other such activities and improve outcomes for payers has improved significantly over the last 2 years and it's starting to be more recognized in productive discussions. Maybe I'll ask Rick Gates, our Head of pharmacy to make some comments for repayments.Rick GatesYes. Obviously, we're in the middle of negotiations, so we can't comment a lot going into '24 at this moment through Medicare Part D and through commercial contracts, which are going on currently and into Q4. But just to reemphasize what James is saying, we're generally in line with expectations on reimbursement this year. We are benefiting from conversations across U.S. health care and pharmacy as they're looking at us as a holistic solution within the health care ecosystem. And we're continuously working on offsets for reimbursement pressure that we're seeing through improved procurement, increased prescriptions, obviously, are important ancillary services, but then also reducing cost to fill. And I just want to reemphasize the other point that James said is that we are overperforming or performing better in pay-for-performance-based contracts, which are obviously part of the reimbursement we get back as well. So I can't comment on '24, but we are in line with expectations for '23 at this moment.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Ann Hynes from Mizuho Securities.Ann Kathleen HynesGreat. So given health care is the main driver of growth next year, what do you think is the biggest risk embedded within that guidance? And then secondly, you commented in your prepared remarks that scripts were lower than expectations. Can you just decide for what is driven by maybe market weakness versus market share weakness versus maybe pharmacy hours now coming back to what were in your expectations?Rosalind Gates BrewerAnn, thanks for that question. I'm going to ask John to hit the first piece on health care, and then Rick and I will talk to you about the scripts business.John P. DriscollYes. Ann, I am really encouraged by the core growth across the portfolio. We've laid out exactly where the challenge is, which is in cost and profit opportunity, and we are laser-focused on executing to unlocking that value. So look for us, as I mentioned in the earlier answer to continue to unlock the embedded profitability of that part of the business. We see positive signs from all of the buyers. It's our responsibility to grow but also to grow and focus on profitable growth, and we will continue to kind of dig in there, and I'm confident that you will see consistent improved performance on that over time.Rosalind Gates BrewerAnn. Let me start off first, just give you a little bit of detail on where we are in our store performance. So at the end of the quarter, we had 1,600 locations on reduced operating hours. And we've recently optimized those hours in about 500 stores, bringing our current stores on reduced operating hours to roughly 1,100. We're continuing to see improvements in pharmacy staffing, resulting in almost 1,100 new pharmacists hired in the quarter. And then to the extent that the incremental pharmacists are hired in our most challenged markets, we've been returning stores to their regular full operating hours. One of the things that we're seeing is that the initial incentives worked, we're at the point now where we're seeing the limitation of available pharmacists. And so Rick, can you go into a little bit more detail on the actual script improvement?Rick GatesYes. And I think, Ann, you're trying to get at the 3% growth that we're talking about through fiscal year '23. I think we've always walked through, there's kind of 4 key drivers to that script comp growth for us. One is market growth. And I think what we've seen in Q3 is that we've seen a slowing of aggregate market growth from Q2 to Q3, which is impacting, obviously, a big part of our underlying performance is there. Roz talked about store hours returning to normal hours, which are lagging a little bit the pace that we had set, given what Roz talked through. But we are seeing some positives as well. The market access that we've contracted coming into this year is flowing through in a very positive way. We continue to have good conversations heading into next year. The adherence and care programs, we are seeing year-over-year growth. They are stagnated a little bit given some of the store hour operation impacts, but we are seeing positive growth year-over-year when you look at access and adherence as well. So although 3% is down from where we earlier guided to, I think the 2 things that are most impacting it are market growth, which has slowed quarter-over-quarter, and the store average returning to normal.James KehoeAnd then maybe I could add. We actually believe there will be significant core growth in the U.S. business next year as well because we'll be absorbing a year-on-year nonoperating headwind from lower sale and leaseback. And then in addition, we mentioned the $290 million headwind on COVID. And maybe go back to the tailwinds and headwinds in short. We have a couple of items you mentioned correctly, U.S. health care. There's a couple more transformational cost management program is at least $800 million of savings, and we've basically identified those savings already. Two, on the front of store business. We have $200 million on -- of CPI, and that's essentially more cost optimization and margin improvement. And then we have synergies in the U.S. health care business, so our cost optimization and savings next year as well in excess of $1 billion, so it's much more controllable and already defined. Now some of that will be eaten up by wages and inflation plus reimbursement pressure, but we're well advanced on savings -- controllable savings of over $1 billion, and a lot of that is in the U.S. business. We basically gave some examples of the cost reduction, just the headquarter restructuring. This was done on the corporate head office, and it was done on the U.S. support office. And those 500 reductions were done in the space of about 4 months, and the savings are in excess of $100 million, so we're moving at pace to address the challenges and really going after the cost envelope.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny from Bank of America.Michael Aaron ChernyMaybe, James, to stay on that thread, I understand the increase in cost savings targets, that's something I know that the company has been really focused on. When you look at that, you look at still what you have from the sale-leaseback contribution and ABC contribution. What does that mean for what the core underlying earnings of this business should be? And how does that factor into where underlying growth should continue versus your previously assume multiyear targets. I know we're not getting into more specific guidance on '24, but you do have the long-term targets already out there. So how does -- what you're doing now and especially how the core is growing factor into achieving those previously reported targets?James KehoeYes. Maybe I'll take it from another direction. And if we look forward to the fourth quarter, we've got a bunch of headwinds in the fourth quarter, and you could actually call out COVID, which is probably 20 points of a headwind and sale and leaseback another 20. So the guide we're basically giving is a slight decline in EPS, but the core growth is more like 30%, 40% growth in the fourth quarter, so we're seeing that the flywheel is working. We've had some pressure on margins in the short term in retail, but the flywheel is starting to perform. Then the second data point is we give -- as we discuss a low to mid-single-digit operating income growth over the entire course of next year, absorbing sale and leaseback and absorbing COVID and any other headwinds that are on the horizon. So if you subtract out those 2, the low to mid-single digit is more like a low teens growth in adjusted operating income, so where we see the flywheel coming back and coming back quickly. If you project that forward, you're right, the sale and leaseback gains run out in '24, so it is the last year. But by then, the improved profit prospects on the health care business, plus the flywheel working in the U.S. business more consistently should get us to those previous targets of low single digit. Now we're not guiding to that. We're not confirming guidance, but we see that the core earnings power is successively improving every quarter. And I think people will be very positively surprised by the quality of earnings, particularly in the fourth quarter of this year. And then going into the next year.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Lucas Romanski from TD Cowen.Lucas Cole RomanskiThis is Lucas on for Charles. Wanted to ask about the U.S. health care business and your appetite for taking on risk there. Last October, you talked about adding health plan partnerships and how the platform -- would enable you to take on risk eventually. Now you have 4 health plan partnerships and you've been able to show the ability to lower MLR from high 80s to low mid-70s in some regions. What are you guys seeing in terms of appetite from health plans in the market now that you have the bulk of your health care delivery assets in place? And then two, how are you thinking about increasing your exposure to risk over time and if you see that as a path to driving earnings growth for the U.S. Healthcare segment moving forward?John P. DriscollLucas, thanks for the question. It's John. We are seeing a remarkably robust appetite for risk of 2 different sorts. One is the per member per month capitated risk in your -- on the MA population, but whether it is performance risk on closing gaps in care or performance opportunities to earn and enhance the delivery of our specialty pharmacy business with the Shields. There is a consistent interest in products and services that in total, lower the cost of care and improve outcomes. And we are very encouraged by the demand across every constituency for every product we've got, whether it's Health Corners, VillageMD, City or Shields or CareCentrix, that the opportunity -- that the track record of performance around delivering on lower cost to care while keeping up a high NPS on the part of the patients and providers and delivering those results will allow us to honestly deliver a portfolio of risk-based and performance-based products that I think are going to be -- are going to build on our notion of being the independent partner of choice for health plans and health systems. So I think we will -- you'll see more and more news about that. and that's part of unlocking the embedded profitability of the assets we own.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse.Albert J. William RiceMaybe quickly, I know it's been missed a couple of times the goal for working capital optimization. Can you maybe expand a little bit more on what you think over time, the incremental cash flow opportunity might be there? And then as you talk about prioritizing debt paydown, what is -- can you give us any updated thoughts on how far you need to -- you feel like you need to go on debt pay down, maybe a leverage target? Any comments on either of those?James KehoeYes. I think on working capital, if you look back over, I'd say, a 5-year period, we've probably reduced working capital by $2.5 billion. Hopefully, it's not as if we haven't done it, but we're sitting on fairly high levels of inventory. We run a front of store above 90 days, which is on the high side. And the second part on pharmacy, we're above 30 days, and both of those for me personally are quite high. We've put in place big initiatives to address those. One is the micro fulfillment centers, which effectively will take a fair amount of inventory out of the 8,800 stores as we centralize into less than 20 centers. When we put together the program that was identified at almost $1 billion of working capital opportunity, we've probably captured 40% of that. And I just want to emphasize, this is a multiyear program we're running, but it's hundreds and hundreds of millions every year on working capital optimization driven by micro fulfillment centers. We have new forecasting systems going in. We're putting in a new inventory management system and perpetual inventory for pharmacy for the first time, and that's rolling out even as we speak. So we have huge initiatives rolling out that will really drive benefits next year. On debt, we're targeting investment-grade rating. We're not within our metrics right now. The target with Moody's is, I think it's [475]. And we have work to do to both improve our operating cash flow, which we just talked about. And then secondly, targeted paydown of debt to get within the metrics. And we expect to do so confidently expect to do so during the course of fiscal '24.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Anderson from Evercore ISI.Elizabeth Hammell AndersonI was wondering if you could talk through how you're thinking about the potential impact of 340B maybe both on the core -- U.S. pharmacy business and sort of what the potential impact could be there. But then also, if you could just really talk about how you're thinking about the potential opportunity in fiscal '24 from Shields in that business.Rick GatesYes. This is Rick, and I'll start and see, John must join me here. But as you look at 340B, we are very comfortable with our prior guidance and do expect 340B to actually be a slight up and production year-over-year in fiscal '23. Current assumptions still taking into account latest manufacturer actions and restrictions. I think there's 3 things to think about as we look at in Q4 is that we do know obviously and have a line of sight since October and the continued developments and restrictions and litigation that can negatively impact the business itself. However, we are working with covered entities who are starting to share data back in a more proactive way, which is opening up their impact to continue to get 340B value back to the governed entities. And third, we continue to work very proactively in the marketplace with covered entities that are still very active and signing up for contract pharmacy. So we do think that we can offset some of the headwinds as we're looking at it, but do still see a good line of sight into what we projected for this year, which is a slight growth. And John, I don't know if you want to add...John P. DriscollI think the Shields is actually -- turns out to be an advantaged position because it's not in the contract pharmacy business. It's really a specialty pharmacy services business for hospital based 340B related specialty pharmacies. And we continue to see strong demand and the sustainability of those contracts. And so we're highly confident that Shields is actually in a great position because of a just core growth of specialty pharmacy drugs and the need for hospitals to partner with a services platform that delivers a best-in-class adherence and integrates really well with hospitals that are -- even to manage those high need chronic patients.OperatorAnd your final question comes from the line of Eric Percher from Nephron Research.Eric R. PercherIt's been difficult to piece together the U.S. health care ramp from what was a $350 million loss to significant profit next year. Now looking at $600 million to $650 million, can you tell us net of the actions you're taking, how does fiscal year '24 look relative to the outlook 6 months ago when you closed? And then any insight on the contributions, which businesses and how they're coming together for the fiscal year '24 outlook?James KehoeYes. Eric, the base year -- so what we're looking at here is the base year has come in about 300 light versus the original expectations 9 months ago, and we've talked extensively about Summit and the some slowness at building patient panels at Village, and we have a series of actions to go address that. I think the best way you could model this out is versus the original goals, the year-on-year change, we believe is absolutely intact. So you might want to think of it in this way, we're probably 6 to 12 months behind, but it will be in 2024, it's unlikely we'll recover the $300 million loss in the base here, but the build year-on-year is intact and probably we would do slightly more. John, is that a fair...John P. DriscollI think that's the right way to look at it. I think, Eric, you should expect that we will -- we laid out that Q4 target of a 70% improvement over Q3. We're not prepared right now to give extensive '24 guidance. And I think we'd probably be [aloof] to give subsegment segment guidance because I think that would even be more confusing. But we are seeing, as I said, the revenue ramp and the demand in each of our markets for each of our companies. And we have taken and are taking swift action to unlock the embedded profitability and a lot of that is a line of sight. So on cost synergies, integration opportunities with solid demand. So I think you'll -- we'll be comfortable giving you more guidance, I think, in Q4, but we see incremental improvement month-over-month in each of these categories towards those targets.James KehoeYes. And just to reemphasize that, Eric, I think when John says the 70%, that means you take the EBITDA loss in Q3, multiply by 30%, and that's -- we will deliver, so we're getting very close to EBITDA breakeven in the fourth quarter, and we have decent line of sight to positive EBITDA for the segment in the first half of next year.OperatorAnd we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Roz Brewer for some final closing remarks.Rosalind Gates BrewerListen, thank you for your questions this morning on the next phase of our health care transformation, the evolution of our pharmacy retail business and also our capital allocation priorities. I hope you heard from us, we have a strong commitment to move swiftly to address our challenges head on and better executing on our priorities and moving at a faster pace to deliver the value to our employees, our shareholders and our local communities. That's important to us. The next phase of our health care transformation requires aggressive actions. And these actions are already in motion and they're focused on improving our profitability against our quality assets. And I want to reinforce that, that we're really committed, we feel good and strong about our investments we've made so far. So we're focused on turning the inherent growth of our assets into profitable growth, where we have embedded profitability in our portfolio already. So we have the scale and the skills and the next phase for us is to operate with urgency, the right plans and drive the growth ahead. So thank you for your time today.OperatorThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.]"

77,655e9bbd-fc73-3ff2-a349-0b4cbff35cb4,ADM,2023-06-28,15 Most Profitable Crops in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-most-profitable-crops-world-131440258.html,1687871680,STORY,['ADM'],"[In this piece, we will take a look at the 15 most profitable crops in the world. If you want to skip our analysis of the global food industry and stocks of food companies in general, head on over to 5 Most Profitable Crops in the World. Societal progress is often marked by a country shifting its economy from the primary to the secondary and tertiary sectors. The primary sector is made of activities that utilize natural resources to earn a living. This includes agriculture, mining, and forestry among others. A shift to the secondary industry brings high value outputs to a country, and the tertiary sector is made of office workers who often produce higher margin outputs such as software and financial services.However, just because farming might make someone less money doesn't mean it's going to go away. After all, no matter how many computers humans build, we still need to eat food. Simply put, one cannot eat a computer or the Internet. And so, the farming industry continues to prosper and tick along, helped by advances in technology that makes crops safer and more profitable. And the ubiquitous demand for food makes the industry worth trillions of dollars. According to data, the global food industry should be worth a whopping $9.43 trillion by the end of this year and is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.27% between 2023 and 2027.This growth is unsurprising given that global caloric consumption has grown over the past years and will continue to grow in the future as well. Data from the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) shows that from the 2,789 kilocalories that it stood at in 2000, global caloric consumption is slated to sit at 3,139 kilocalories by 2050 to mark a 12% growth.At the same time, not all crops are equally profitable. While some crops, such as corn and wheat are grown primarily for food, others are grown for profit. These crops are called cash crops, and the list of cash crops varies by country. In America, some cash crops grown are oranges, corn, and soybeans. In fact, America is one of the biggest producers and exporters of corn, and it produced 360 million tons in 2020. This accounted for a significant portion of global corn production, with global corn production in the next year (2021) sitting at 1.1 billion tons.Story continuesThe immutable global need for food has also led to some of the biggest companies in the world also being food companies. Some food stocks that belong to firms ranking high in the list of the world's biggest companies are The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP), McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), and Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ). And, contrary to the popular belief of being less profitable the bigger you get, these firms are also more profitable than the industry average. McDonald's has a profit margin of 26% while Coca-Cola has a profit margin of 22% - both of which are higher than the industry averages of 9% and 14.6%, respectively.Just as a small business is unlikely to grow into the next McDonald's, growing different kinds of crops have different requirements. And there are a variety of crops that beginning farmers can grow to ensure that their inputs and time yield favorable results that might even lead to some money flowing in. Some of the best cash crops that beginning and small farmers can grow include bamboo, mushrooms, garlic, and even Christmas trees!Apart from food companies, agribusiness and farming companies are also quite big. Some of the top agricultural companies, such as The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS), Corteva, Inc. (NYSE:CTVA), and Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) have market capitalization going in the billions of dollars. And, the biggest agricultural businesses in terms of revenue often rake in hundreds and billions of dollars each year in the form of net sales.At the same time, technology has also made an impact on the farming industry. One new trend is what is called vertical farming.  As the name suggests, this involves growing crops on vertical plans to squeeze out more yield per acreage. The U.S. government is investing millions of dollars to support innovation in agriculture, and the corporate world is already picking up the mantle. If you are interested in vertical farming, then some of the best stocks are are favored by hedge funds are The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (NYSE:SMG), Hydrofarm Holdings Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:HYFM), and AppHarvest, Inc. (NASDAQ:APPH).Finally, while the U.S. might lead the world in corn production, it isn't the world's biggest food producer per capita. In fact, the top five food producing countries per capita are Brazil, Paraguay, Australia, Argentina, and Ukraine.Finally, worries about inflation and recession are causing concern for nearly every industry in the economy. On this front, here's what the management of Archer-Daniels had to say during the firm's latest earnings call conference:Before we wrap up today, I wanted to share some insights into how we’re thinking about the remainder of 2023 and how we are positioning the company to take on the next phase of opportunities. We are confident that ADM will be able to deliver on our plans for 2023 despite some pockets of soft demand. Supply and demand shift are allowing ADM to flex our integrated value chain, in support of another strong year of results. We continue to advance partnership agreements with major players across multiple industries from regenerative agriculture to alternative proteins, to sustainable fuels, to plant-based industrial and personal care products. All of these partnerships are supporting ADM as we evolve at pace with the external environment to capture new growth opportunities.We see accelerated upsides emerging from product areas like biosolutions expected to grow at double-digit rates again this year. We have significant production capacity coming online within the year across our three businesses to support continued demand growth. And we’re driving forward the broad-based decarbonization agenda in our Decatur complex, which is unlocking both near-term and long-range value for our customers across multiple industries. With a combination of solid business performance in the core business, along with the strong growth opportunities across our value chain, we expect that we will be able to deliver between $6 to $7 in earnings per share in 2023 and based on the strength of our balance sheet and cash position, we continue to pursue opportunities to deliver both near-term value to shareholders while positioning ADM for its next phase of growth.With these details in mind, let's take a look at the most profitable crops in the world.15 Most Profitable Crops in the WorldPhoto by CDC on UnsplashOur Methodology To compile our list of the most profitable crops, we used the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) data to calculate the value per acre of 155 crops. Out of these, the top 15 most profitable crops in the world were chosen for this list.15 Most Profitable Crops in the World15. WatermelonsGross Production Value Per Acre: $5,776Watermelon is the fruit for the summer. It is one of the best sources of water on a hot day and helps keep people hydrated. Growing watermelons requires slightly alkaline or neutral soil with moderate temperatures. A beehive is also recommended to make sure that pests do not destroy or damage the crop.14. Peaches and NectarinesGross Production Value Per Acre: $5,805Peaches and Nectarines are almost the same food, with the only main difference between the two being that the former has the characteristic fuzzy skin while the skin of a nectarine is smooth. They are grown from trees, so first time growers will have to wait for the tree to fully grow before it produces the fruit.13. Pomelos and GrapefruitsGross Production Value Per Acre: $5,825Grapefruit is the cross breed of a pomelo with an orange. Like peaches, it is also grown on trees, and is known for its sweet and tangy flavor.12. Chilies and peppers, greenGross Production Value Per Acre: $6,186Green chilies and pepper are not for the faint of heart, at least when it comes to eating them. They are also some of the rare vegetables that have seen interest from psychologists, who believe that people who consume chilies can safely experience extreme emotions in a safe environment.11. Green GarlicGross Production Value Per Acre: $6,487Green garlic, despite what the name suggests, is not a special kind of garlic. Instead, its simply garlic that has not fully grown. Garlic itself is one of the most well known cash crops. Green garlic is one of the most beneficial foods for health, with high amounts of antioxidants.10. BlueberriesGross Production Value Per Acre: $6,683Blueberries are one of the few super foods, proponents of which claim that they can help with the immune system, diabetes, and overall health. They are grown all over the world, and can also be plucked from the wild.9. KiwifruitGross Production Value Per Acre: $6,850Kiwifruit is typically grown on canes which require careful pruning to ensure fruit health and yield. China is the biggest producer, but the fruit is grown all over the world across different continents.8. TomatoesGross Production Value Per Acre: $7,873 Tomatoes are the soul of most dishes, lending them a characteristic red color and a distinct tangy taste. They are quite easy to grow as well and can be grown at home in pots or in gardens.7. Cucumbers and GherkinsGross Production Value Per Acre: $10,226Cucumbers and gherkins belong to the same line of vegetables but are grown differently. The former is rather tasteless while the latter has a pickled flavor.6. CranberryGross Production Value Per Acre: $10,364Large cranberry fields are some of the best looking agriculture sites that you will come across. A vast sea of red, they are grown in areas with a shallow water table.Click to continue reading and see 5 Most Profitable Crops in the World.Suggested Articles:15 Countries That Produce the Most Solar Energy20 Countries with the Highest Wheat Consumption21 Best Selling Phones of All TimeDisclosure: None. 15 Most Profitable Crops in the World is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Delta Air Lines DAL, Alaska Air Group ALK, Southwest Airlines LUV and SkyWest SKYW.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Are Airline Stocks Becoming More Shareholder Friendly?The Zacks Airline industry was one of the hardest-hit corners in the investment space during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, things started to brighten from last year with the lessening of the severity of the pandemic, the subsequent easing of restrictions and the reopening of the global economy.Solid recovery of air travel demand, both domestic and international, has been benefiting theindustry. People are again booking flights, leading to higher passenger revenues and contributing to most airlines’ top line. Driven by increased passenger revenues, the financial health of airlines has improved.Moreover, the lifting of restrictions under the CARES Act has allowed airline companies to initiate shareholder-friendly activities. The restrictions, under the CARES Act, prohibited airline companies from paying dividends or buying back shares till Sep 30, 2022. With the restrictions no longer in place, Delta Air Lines, Alaska Air Group, Southwest Airlines and SkyWest have made use of their financial strength and resumed dividend payouts or share repurchases, in turn, highlighting their pro-shareholder stance.Delta Air Lines and Alaska Air currently carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while Southwest Airlines and SkyWest carry a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold) each. You can seethe complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Let’s take an in-depth look at these companies’ shareholder-friendly initiatives.Story continuesDelta Air Lines recently announced the resumption of its dividend payout. DAL’s board of directors has approved a dividend payment of 10 cents per share. The renewed dividend will be paid on Aug 7, 2023, to all its shareholders of record as of Jul 17, 2023. The move reflects DAL’s intention to utilize free cash to enhance its shareholders’ returns.This resumption reflects Delta's progress on its three-year financial plan (which includes debt repayment of more than $10 billion in the last two years).Southwest Airlines also decided to start paying quarterly dividends after a pandemic-induced hiatus of more than two years following the removal of the restrictions. In December 2022, LUV’s management announced that it was reinstating its quarterly dividend of 18 cents per share. With this, LUV’s board of directors declared its 177th quarterly dividend payout in May 2023. The dividend will be paid out on Jul 12, 2023, to its shareholders of record at the close of business on Jun 21, 2023.Alaska Air’s management resumed share repurchases this year. In first-quarter 2023, ALK purchased 413,554 shares for $18 million. The company expects share repurchases of at least $100 million in 2023.SkyWest, in first-quarter 2023, repurchased 5.1 million shares for $100 million (which reflected 10% of SKYW’s outstanding shares as of Dec 31, 2022). The shares were repurchased under SkyWest’s previously announced share repurchase program.Management’s decision to resume dividend payments and share buybacks reflects the stock’s financial strength. Such moves also indicate the company’s commitment to boosting shareholder value apart from its strong free cash flow-generating ability and underlining confidence in its business. These initiatives not only instill investors’ confidence in the stock but positively impacts its earnings per share.Year-to-date Price PerformanceAll the abovementioned stocks have gained with respect to price in the year-to-date period.Wrapping upWith passenger volumes likely to remain healthy, airlines are expected to remain in good shape financially. Consequently, shareholder-friendly activities are anticipated to gain further momentum.That airlines will continue to fly high is highlighted by the fact that the International Air Transport Association (IATA) doubled its current-year forecast for net profits for airlines across the globe. Passenger revenues are the biggest driver of the rosy projection for 2023. Per IATA, passenger revenues in 2023 are now anticipated to be $546 billion compared with the previous estimate of $522 billion. The revised revenue forecast indicates a 27% increase from the 2022 actuals.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

86,bce00b3f-8a95-3230-a054-ee220cab24e6,PM,2023-06-28,"New Study by KPMG Reveals Alarming Levels of Illicit Cigarettes in the EU, with France Accounting for Almost Half of the Consumption",Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/study-kpmg-reveals-alarming-levels-081200538.html,1687939920,STORY,['PM'],"[In 2022, the illicit market in the European Union continued its growing trend, rising by an estimated 0.7%, mainly driven by increases in countries like France and Belgium.France remains the largest illicit market in the EU and now accounts for 47% of total illicit cigarette consumption in the region. An estimated 8 billion illicit cigarettes consumed in France were counterfeited products.LAUSANNE, Switzerland, June 28, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Philip Morris International Inc. (PMI) (NYSE: PM) today warns about increasing rates of illicit cigarette consumption in the European Union (EU), which are depriving governments of billions in tax revenues and eroding tobacco control policies. PMI calls for a reassessment of policy choices that may be contributing to the year-over-year growth of the illicit market in the region and for innovative approaches that can help drive millions away from continued smoking to be considered.The 2022 KPMG annual study on illicit cigarette consumption in the EU, U.K., Norway, Switzerland, Moldova and Ukraine, commissioned by Philip Morris Products SA, reveals that 35.8 billion illicit cigarettes were consumed across the EU alone, causing governments the loss of an estimated €11.3 billion in tax revenue—8.5% more than in 2021. The growth of the illicit market in the EU was partly driven by the continued rise of counterfeit consumption, which reached its highest level ever recorded. Notably, the vast majority of counterfeits (61.5%) were consumed in France.""Some countries unwilling to embrace innovation and make better alternatives to cigarettes available to adult smokers who would otherwise continue smoking continue to rely on policies that have contributed to the current state of illicit trade. The cost of ignoring the negative impact of illicit cigarettes on adult smokers, and on public health, is too high to turn a blind eye to,"" stated Gregoire Verdeaux, senior vice president of External Affairs, PMI. ""It has truly become a ‘made in the EU’ problem, as fake cigarettes are being manufactured, distributed, sold, and consumed in countries within the EU, undermining efforts to reduce and eliminate cigarette smoking—and public health goals altogether.""Story continuesAccording to interviews with law enforcement agencies included in the KPMG report, the production and distribution of counterfeit cigarettes within EU borders is increasing, with criminal organizations centering their activities toward higher-taxed and higher-priced EU member states and gaining larger profits. Countries such as Belgium, Denmark, France, and Germany are witnessing a growth in cigarette seizures and raids on clandestine manufacturing operations.""The KPMG report clearly shows how the growth of the illicit cigarette market poses an existential threat to the industry’s sustainability and transformation in Europe. We can observe how the illicit cigarette problem in the EU has become highly concentrated in a handful of countries, where governments have not embraced innovative approaches to effectively deter millions from continued smoking,"" added Verdeaux. ""Traditional tobacco control policies are simply not enough. Aggressive fiscal policies, prohibitionist approaches, and lack of deterrence in countries like France and Belgium are only benefitting criminals and pushing adult smokers toward the black market.""Despite the overall illicit consumption increase, the KPMG study notes that the majority of EU members— 21 out of 27 countries—experienced a stable or declining share of illicit cigarette consumption in 2022. Excluding France, overall illicit consumption in the remaining markets in the study declined by 7.5%, largely due to decreases in Greece, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Romania. Particularly, in countries like Poland and Romania, illicit consumption reached the lowest-ever incidence since KPMG began publishing its annual studies.""Effective policymaking, fiscal calendars, deterrent penalties, and impactful enforcement are enabling several EU member states to experience a decline in the consumption of illicit cigarettes,"" said Massimo Andolina, president Europe region at PMI. ""In other countries, it is unfortunate to witness the legal market shifting toward one that is run by criminal networks, which attest to the failure of disproportionate tax increases, and regulatory frameworks that do not contemplate the principle of risk differentiation. The KPMG report should serve as a wake-up call for regulators and policymakers in the EU to consider that millions of consumers are relying on the black market to continue smoking.""Moldova and Ukraine were included in the KPMG report for the first time. The 2022 findings placed Ukraine as the second-largest market in Europe for illicit cigarette consumption, with 7.4 billion cigarettes, behind France’s 16.9 billion. The share of illicit cigarettes in Ukraine has followed an increasing trend since 2018—in 2022, one out of five cigarettes consumed stemmed from the illicit market. The third-largest illicit market in Europe is the U.K., with 5.9 billion illicit cigarettes, on the rise since 2020.""In these times of economic hardship, with inflation putting extra pressure on consumer purchasing power, we need robust law enforcement, comprehensive regulatory approaches and forward-thinking policies that can help improve the lives of millions of adults who continue to smoke,"" noted Verdeaux. ""This includes the adoption of differentiated policies on alternatives to cigarettes, including access to information about better alternatives, and smoke-free products that are available and affordable for all. No one should be left behind.""A detailed overview of the results and methodology of the KPMG report is available here.For more information about PMI’s illicit trade prevention efforts, visit PMI.com.Note to editorsFor PMI, eliminating the illicit tobacco trade has been a long-standing priority. We rely on the latest technology to secure our supply chain and protect our products, while implementing preventive and protective measures to fight illicit trade and working with public and private sectors to advance efforts against this global issue. PMI continues to support relevant regulations like the FCTC Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products and the EU Tobacco Products Directives’ tracking-and-tracing provisions.The KPMG report estimates the size and scale of illicit cigarette consumption, known as counterfeit &amp; contraband (C&amp;C), which includes illicit whites. The annual study defines these in its glossary as follows:- Contraband: ""Genuine products that have been either bought in a lower-tax country and exceed legal border limits or acquired without taxes for export purposes to be illegally re-sold (for financial profit) in a higher priced market.""- Counterfeit: ""Cigarettes that are illegally manufactured and sold by a party other than the original trademark owner.""- Illicit whites: ""Cigarettes that are usually manufactured legally in one country/market, but that evidence suggests have been smuggled across borders during their transit to the destination market under review where they have limited or no legal distribution and are sold without payment of tax.""More information about the share incidence of each illicit category is available on page 12 of the KPMG report.Forward-Looking &amp; Cautionary StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding regulatory, market, and industry expectations as well as business goals and strategies.

PMI's future profitability may also be adversely affected should it be unsuccessful in its attempts to produce and commercialize reduced-risk products or if regulation or taxation do not differentiate between such products and cigarettes; if it is unable to successfully introduce new products, promote brand equity, enter new markets or improve its margins through increased prices and productivity gains; if it is unable to expand its brand portfolio internally or through acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships; if it is unable to attract and retain the best global talent, including women or diverse candidates; or if it is unable to successfully integrate and realize the expected benefits from recent transactions and acquisitions. Future results are also subject to the lower predictability of our reduced-risk product category's performance.PMI is further subject to other risks detailed from time to time in its publicly filed documents, including PMI's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, and the Form 10-Q for the first quarter ended March 31, 2023. PMI cautions that the foregoing list of important factors is not a complete discussion of all potential risks and uncertainties. PMI does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that it may make from time to time, except in the normal course of its public disclosure obligations.Philip Morris International: Delivering a Smoke-Free FuturePhilip Morris International (PMI) is a leading international tobacco company working to deliver a smoke-free future and evolving its portfolio for the long term to include products outside of the tobacco and nicotine sector. The company’s current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products. Since 2008, PMI has invested more than USD 10.5 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies. In November 2022, PMI acquired Swedish Match - a leader in oral nicotine delivery - creating a global smoke-free champion led by the companies’ IQOS and ZYN brands. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized versions of PMI’s IQOS Platform 1 devices and consumables and Swedish Match’s General snus as Modified Risk Tobacco Products (MRTPs). As of March 31, 2023, PMI’s smoke-free products were available for sale in 78 markets, and PMI estimates that approximately 18.5 million adults around the world had already switched to IQOS and stopped smoking. Smoke-free products accounted for approximately 35% of PMI’s total 2023 first-quarter net revenues. With a strong foundation and significant expertise in life sciences, PMI announced in February 2021 its ambition to expand into wellness and healthcare areas and, through its Vectura Fertin Pharma business, aims to enhance life through the delivery of seamless health experiences.

HCA is aided by improved patient volumes, acquisitions of healthcare facilities and a commendable financial position. A positive business outlook for 2023 reinforces investors’ confidence in the stock.Top Zacks Rank &amp; Upbeat Price PerformanceHCA Healthcare currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The stock has soared 67.7% in a year, compared with the industry’s 53.7% growth. The Zacks Medical sector has declined 6.8% but the S&amp;P 500 composite has risen 13.9% in the same time frame.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFavorable Style ScoreHCA Healthcare carries an impressive Value Score of A. Value Score helps find stocks that are undervalued. Back-tested results have shown so far that stocks with a favorable Value Score in combination with a solid Zacks Rank are the best investment bets.Robust ProspectsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for HCA’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $18.10 per share, suggesting growth of 7.2% from the prior-year reported figure. The consensus mark for revenues stands at $63.4 billion, implying a rise of 5.3% from the year-ago reported number.The consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pegged at $19.69 per share, indicating an improvement of 8.8% from the prior-year estimate. The same for revenues stands at $66.7 billion, hinting at a 5.2% increase from the year-ago estimate.Decent Earnings Surprise HistoryHCA Healthcare’s bottom line outpaced estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the mark once, the average surprise being 9.04%.A Strong View for 2023HCA forecasts revenues within $62.5-$64.5 billion this year, the midpoint of which suggests 5.5% growth from the 2022 figure. Earnings per share are anticipated between $17.25 and $18.55, the midpoint of which indicates an improvement of 6% from the 2022 level.Key Business TailwindsWitnessing a CAGR of 6.2% over the past decade (2012-2022), the top line of HCA Healthcare continues to benefit on the back of a growing patient base. At the Goldman Sachs Global Healthcare Conference, an official of UnitedHealth Group UNH hinted toward the resumption of pent-up elective procedures, which were earlier temporarily put on hold due to COVID-induced volatilities. This brings a ray of hope for healthcare facility operators like HCA Healthcare.Story continuesHigher elective surgeries will bring about improved inpatient occupancy levels, thereby boosting the revenues of HCA Healthcare. Growing outpatient and emergency room visits are likely to continue providing an impetus to its top-line growth.A series of acquisitions undertaken over the years have broadened HCA’s healthcare portfolio, diversified income streams and expanded the nationwide presence of the hospital operator. In May 2023, the buyout of 41 urgent care centers located in Texas from FastMed, a private healthcare service provider, bore testament to HCA’s efforts to solidify its urgent care operations and expand its footprint across the state. The transaction is expected to be completed by this summer.To enable patients to receive enhanced healthcare services within the comfort of their home, the company has devised a solid telehealth services suite in place. HCA Healthcare also operates psychiatric hospitals in order to address the growing incidence of mental health issues among Americans. To pursue uninterrupted growth-related initiatives, a solid financial position is a dire need. The same is the case with HCA Healthcare which contains sufficient cash reserves and solid cash-generation abilities. It generated operating cash flows of $1,803 million in the first quarter of 2023, up 34.1% year over year. Robust cash flows also enable it to tactically deploy capital via share buybacks and dividend payments. Management approved a 7.1% increase in the quarterly dividend in January 2023.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks in the Medical space are Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. AMPH and Penumbra, Inc. PEN, each currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The acquisition of Oak Street Health is expected to advance CVS Health’s care delivery strategy for consumers. However, poor macroeconomic conditions and stiff competition are headwinds.In the past year, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 23% compared with the industry’s 23.3% fall and the S&amp;P 500’s 15.8% rise.The pharmacy innovation company, with integrated offerings across the entire spectrum of pharmacy care, has a market capitalization of $89.56 billion. The company projects a 6.4% growth for the next five years. It surpassed estimates in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 6.5%.Riding on current business growth and bullish near-term prospects, the company is worth retaining for now.Key Growth CatalystsHealth Care Benefit Shows Potential: Following the colossal acquisition of health insurance giant Aetna for a colossal sum of $70 billion, CVS Health introduced its Health Care Benefits business arm. This segment has been exhibiting continued strong momentum in the past few quarters. In the first quarter, the segment’s revenues increased more than 12%. Overall medical costs were well controlled and in line with expectations. Membership in the first quarter increased by 1 million members versus the prior year’s levels. The upside was primarily driven by the significant increase in the individual exchange business.Health Services Business Gaining Traction: In the first quarter, CVS Health achieved robust revenue growth within Health Services (previously known as the Pharmacy segment). Revenues were up 12.6% in the reported quarter, driven by pharmacy claims growth, specialty pharmacy and brand inflation. The upside was partially offset by continued client price improvements. Total pharmacy claims processed rose 3.7% on a 30-day equivalent basis, attributable to net new business in 2023, increased utilization and the impact of an elevated cough, cold and flu season.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn May 2023, CVS Health completed its acquisition of Oak Street Health. The buyout will broaden CVS' value-based primary care platform and improve patients’ long-term health through better outcomes and lower costs — particularly for those in underserved communities.Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness on a Growth Track: During the first quarter, the company noted that its considerable expansion in retail pharmacy led to significant market share increases over time. This demonstrates the benefit offered to pharmacy patients and the investments made to enhance their experiences. Front-store sales increased by 5% or nearly 8% on a same-store basis, thanks to growth in a number of categories, including consumer health items, personal care and cosmetics.DownsidesCompetitive Landscape: In spite of significant new client wins in the course of a strong selling season, intense competition and tough industry conditions are impediments. Major competitors such as Walgreens, Target and Wal-Mart are expanding their pharmacy businesses.

Discount retailers have made substantial inroads in gaining market share.Poor Macroeconomic Condition: Although prescriptions and related health care service providers like CVS stay out of general macro-economic turmoil, the recent debt crisis and sluggish economic conditions in the United States could impact consumer purchasing power.

The optimism led by a solid first-quarter 2023 performance and its slew of regulatory approvals are expected to contribute further. However, concerns regarding overdependence on Masimo SET and stiff competition persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has gained 18.7% compared with the industry’s 10.8% rise and the S&amp;P 500's 13.3% growth.The renowned global provider of non-invasive monitoring systems has a market capitalization of $8.59 billion. The company projects 3.7% growth for 2023 and expects to maintain its strong performance. Masimo has delivered an earnings surprise of 9.9% for the past four quarters, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Product Suite: We are upbeat about Masimo’s product pipeline. This month, the company announced that it is expanding its premium Denon brand to introduce its latest offering, Masimo AAT (Adaptive Acoustic Technology). The products offered are Denon PerL and PerL Pro True Wireless Earbuds featuring Masimo AAT.In May, it announced the global expansion of the HEOS platform, an iconic brand within its non-healthcare premium and luxury consumer audio business. The expansion enables an always-on connection to the Masimo Health secure cloud for 4 million devices.Regulatory Approvals: Masimo has been receiving regulatory approvals for its products over the past few months, raising our optimism. This month, the company announced that its patient-worn, continuous multi-parameter vital signs monitor, Radius VSM, had received the FDA’s 510(k) clearance.In April, Masimo announced the receipt of the FDA’s 510(k) clearance for its Rad-G with Temperature.Strong Q1 Results: Masimo’s solid first-quarter 2023 results buoy our optimism. The company recorded a robust uptick in the top line, its healthcare business and order shipments in the reported period. The expansion of the company’s installed base was also seen. On the first-quarter earnings call in May, Masimo’s management confirmed having new customers in its pulse oximetry business, and witnessed increasing traction for rainbow and advanced parameter products, which strengthened the healthcare revenues in the quarter.Story continuesDownsidesOverdependence on Masimo SET: Masimo currently derives the majority of its revenues from its primary product offerings like the Masimo SET platform, Masimo rainbow SET platform and related products. Thus, the company’s business is highly dependent on the continued success and market acceptance of its primary product offerings.Stiff Competition: Masimo operates in an intensely competitive medical device industry and is significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants. The Masimo SET platform faces additional competition from companies developing products for use with third-party monitoring systems and from companies currently marketing their pulse oximetry monitors.Estimate TrendMasimo has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings per share has moved north by a penny to $4.76.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s second-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $550.9 million, suggesting a 2.6% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

According to the Motley Fool, its stock has surged by 44% year to date and an impressive 137% over the past year, following a sharp decline of over two-thirds in value spanning 2021 and 2022. The significant gains can be attributed to the implementation of password-sharing fees and the introduction of a new ad-supported subscription option.Introduction of Paid SharingNetflix's introduction of paid sharing has sparked significant controversy. In the past, the streaming service tolerated password sharing as a way to promote its platform and potentially convert borrowers into direct subscribers. However, as Netflix's user base matured, the company decided to restricts account usage to the account holder and their household, offering an option to share the account with non-household members for an additional $7.99 per month.The move was welcomed by analysts, perceiving it as a nearly cost-free way to generate substantial incremental profit. Since implementing this change in May, Netflix's stock has surged, and there has been a notable increase in new subscriptions.Impact of Netflix's New Ad TierThe introduction of the ad tier is anticipated to offer long-term benefits by creating an additional revenue stream and supplementing subscriber payments. While the majority of subscribers are projected to stick with the ad-free tier, Netflix's ad-supported option has successfully attracted new subscribers.Since its launch just six months ago, the ad tier has already gained nearly 5 million subscribers as of May. Remarkably, in markets where it is available, over 25% of new subscribers are opting for the ad-supported tier.Entering the next phase of its content growth, the streaming company looks to optimize costs and enhance user engagement.Story continuesIncreasing Global ExpansionAs Netflix embraces a more deliberate strategy to enhance content engagement, the company’s push for global content comes up as a main driver for fuelling future growth. As per Yahoo Finance, Netflix Co-CEO Ted Sarandos reaffirmed the company's pledge to invest $2.5 billion in original Korean content within the next four years.Sarandos revealed that approximately 60% of Netflix users have viewed a Korean show, highlighting the significant viewership of Korean content. Currently, around two-thirds of Netflix subscribers originate from outside the United States.Generally, non-U.S. productions offer a cost advantage while upholding exceptional quality, which presents a favorable scenario for Netflix. The growing demand for international content, coupled with its increasing acceptance among U.S. audiences, further supports this trend.ETFs in FocusAgainst this backdrop, investors can play Netflix-heavy ETFs to ride the streaming wave. Below, we highlight a few ETFs with exposure to Netflix.MicroSectors FANG+ ETN (FNGS)The MicroSectors FANG+ ETNs is linked to the performance of the NYSE FANG+ Index, which provides exposure to a group of highly-traded growth stocks of next-generation technology and tech-enabled companies.

Their status as a hot commodity helped them land multimillion-dollar deals with streaming giants Netflix and Spotify, as well as voiceover deals, awards and primetime interviews—including an explosive conversation with Oprah Winfrey.https://www.youtube.com/embed/7oxlCKMlpZwPrince Harry’s bestselling memoir, Spare, broke sales records upon its release earlier this year, and the couple’s intimate and revelatory Netflix documentary, Harry &amp; Meghan, became the platform’s most-watched documentary debut in late 2022.Meanwhile, their production company Archewell’s multiyear Spotify partnership spawned Meghan’s Archetypes podcast, which was an instant hit when it premiered with an interview with tennis legend Serena Williams.“I loved digging my hands into the process, sitting up late at night in bed, working on the writing and creative. And I loved digging deep into meaningful conversation with my diverse and inspiring guests, laughing and learning with them, and with each of you listening,” Meghan said when the podcast was released.‘F***ing grifters’More recently, however, the Hollywood tide appears to have turned on the Sussexes.Earlier this month, the couple and Spotify announced that they had mutually agreed to part ways, meaning the 13-episode Archetypes podcast—the only content to come out of the $20 million deal—would come to an end.The series, which focused on issues holding women back and featured a plethora of celebrity guests including Mariah Carey and Paris Hilton, reportedly failed to hit targets despite its early success.Earlier this week, it was reported that pop superstar Taylor Swift declined a handwritten invitation from Meghan to appear on the podcast. The reasons behind the snub were not made clear.Story continuesAfter Archetypes was axed, Spotify executive Bill Simmons publicly denounced Harry and Meghan as “f***ing grifters,” suggesting on his own podcast that he had once had a difficult brainstorming session with Prince Harry over Zoom.Simmons has made no secret of his disdain for the royal, once describing being associated with the same company as Prince Harry as “embarrassing.”“What does he bring to the table? He just whines about s**t and keeps giving interviews,” he said in a 2022 interview. “Who gives a s**t? Who cares about your life? You weren’t even the favorite son.”United Talent Agency CEO Jeremy Zimmer told Semafor in an interview published on Monday that the problem the couple really had with Spotify was that “Meghan Markle was not a great audio talent, or necessarily any kind of talent.”“Just because you're famous doesn't make you great at something,” he said.Zimmer’s comments came amid multiple reports that the couple are in over their heads when it comes to media production.Prince Harry, meanwhile, reportedly pitched a podcast exploring childhood trauma’s impact on powerful men, with proposed guests including former U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin. It was one of many ideas the royal floated during his three-year partnership with Spotify—none of which materialized into podcasts—and led to a barrage of criticism when the nature of his ideas emerged.His struggle to conceptualize an idea for a podcast series meant the Sussexes failed to meet the terms of their deal with Sportify, according to the Wall Street Journal, which reportedly included an agreement that each of them would voice and have hands-on involvement with a podcast.Earlier this week, the WSJ reported that Harry and Meghan’s $100 million Netflix deal, like the Spotify partnership, has led to more cancellations and rejections than produced shows—with sources telling the news outlet that the streaming giant is unlikely to renew the deal when it ends in 2025.Their production company, Archewell, did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment.An animated children’s series called Pearl that the couple hoped to make for Netflix was ultimately canceled, with at least two other television ideas the duo proposed failing to be greenlit by the company, according to the WSJ.Live to Lead, Harry and Meghan’s second project for Netflix—which followed their eponymous fly-on-the wall documentary—failed to break into the streaming platform’s Top 10 chart. A Netflix documentary about the Invictus Games, one of Prince Harry’s most valued causes, is nearing completion.But the newspaper’s sources alleged that Netflix executives had been left dissatisfied with Archewell’s productivity, reportedly complaining that their initial documentary is all they have to show for the company’s costly partnership with the pair.U.K. newspaper The Sun also reported last week that the Netflix deal was unlikely to be renewed.“There is a less friendly attitude from some at the top,” a source told the outlet, adding that the “big bucks” the couple signed on for no longer exist in 2023’s streaming industry, which has taken a blow from unstable subscription numbers and a Hollywood writers’ strike.“The feeling is that the lemon has been fully squeezed,” the anonymous source told The Sun.A royal commentator, meanwhile, labeled the couple “a one trick pony” as far as Netflix is concerned, and told newspaper The Expressthat A-listers and corporations “are distancing themselves…because they seem to be a flop.”A Netflix spokesperson told Fortune on Tuesday, however, that the firm’s relationship with Harry and Meghan remains strong.""We value our partnership with Archewell Productions,” they said. “Harry &amp; Meghan was Netflix's biggest documentary debut ever, and we'll continue to work together on a number of projects, including the upcoming documentary series Heart of Invictus.""Anonymous sources who have worked with Harry and Meghan told the WSJ that the couple’s inexperience as producers, difficulties finding material that would gel with their brand and still drum up audience interest, and a general rejig in the media landscape after the pandemic, have all acted as barriers to their success. Their company lacks direction, insiders said, and often follows a “big idea, subpar execution” route.Richard Fitzwilliams, a U.K.-based royal commentator who has been following Britain’s Royal Family for decades, told Fortune in a phone call that losing the Netflix contract would be “very damaging” for Harry and Meghan. “You wonder who is advising them and [if they are] actually going to produce something with substance because obviously, these huge contracts, they want bang for their buck,” he said.“The thing is, most of the interest in them has been because they've gone rogue, because they launched—very successfully—a variety of attacks on the Royal Family, and the main interest is in that. [But] that's not inexhaustible, they could probably live off it for a few years. And what happens then?”If the Sussexes’ deal with Netflix does end up on the chopping block, Fitzwilliams said there is “a possibility of [them] doing very badly” in Hollywood.“If that's the case, I think they've a lot to worry about,” he added.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

It raised concerns about potential disruptions in global oil supplies.Considering the current situation, an investor might not feel encouraged to invest in the stock market. However, a prudent investor knows that this is the right time to buy stocks that are safe bets. To this end, we recommend stocks like Terex Corp, The TJX Companies,Linde PLC, Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance and Alaska Air Group, which bear low leverage. These picks can shield investors from incurring losses in times of crisis.Now, before selecting low-leverage stocks, let’s explore what leverage is and how choosing a low-leverage stock helps investors.In finance, leverage is a term used to denote the practice of borrowing capital by companies to run their operations smoothly and expand the same. Such borrowings are done through debt financing. But there remains an option for equity finance. This is probably due to the cheap and easy availability of debt over equity financing.However, debt financing has its share of drawbacks. Particularly, it is desirable only as long as it successfully generates a higher rate of return compared to the interest rate. So, to avoid considerable losses in your portfolio, one should always avoid companies that resort to exorbitant debt financing.The crux of safe investment lies in choosing a company that is not burdened with debt, as a debt-free stock is almost impossible to find.The equity market can be volatile at times and as an investor, if you don’t want to lose big time, we suggest you invest in stocks, which bear low leverage and are hence less risky.Story continuesTo identify such stocks, historically, several leverage ratios have been developed to measure the amount of debt a company bears and the debt-to-equity ratio is one of the most common ratios.Analyzing Debt/EquityDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders’ EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A lower debt-to-equity ratio reflects improved solvency for a company.With the second-quarter earnings cycle ahead of us, investors must be eyeing stocks that have exhibited solid earnings growth in the recent past. But if a stock bears a high debt-to-equity ratio in times of economic downturn, its so-called booming earnings picture might turn into a nightmare.The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors, it is prudent to choose stocks with a low debt-to-equity ratio to ensure steady returns.Yet, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors.Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here we present our five picks out of the 11 stocks that made it through the screen.Terex: It is a global manufacturer of aerial work platforms, materials processing machinery and cranes.

E-commerce, which has played a major role in driving sales, rose once again in June.

112,f00ab01c-7a5b-3091-a26b-ce0b165284d3,NEM,2023-06-28,20 Countries With Highest Gold Consumption By Year,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-countries-highest-gold-consumption-040517033.html,1687925117,STORY,"['GC=F', 'HG=F', 'RIO', 'GOLD', 'NEM']","[In this insightful article, we'll dive into the the list of 20  Countries With Highest Gold Consumption By Year, along with looking at the change in their gold trends over the years. If you want to skip the details, jump to 8 Countries With Highest Gold Consumption By Year.The countries with the highest gold consumption by year have exhibited consistency in the past decade. According to the World Gold Council, India and China were the largest gold consuming countries in 2010, and both nations maintained this status in 2022 with a consumption of 824.9 and 774 metric tons, respectively. Following China and India, are the United States, Saudi Arabia, Germany, Turkey, and Iran. However, strict quarantine measures in China and the Covid outbreak in India resulted in a temporary downturn in consumer-level purchases. China's gold demand reached an all-time low since 2010 to 641 metric tons in 2020. Likewise, India's gold consumption took a hit amidst the pandemic and plunged to 446 metric tons in 2020.Although countries with the highest gold consumption in the world have been the same over the past few decades, some variations can be there, with nations either escalating or curtailing their gold consumption. A considerable reflection in these patterns appeared after the global economic crisis in 2009, after which, central banks globally began to increase their gold reserves. Shifting towards maintaining and increasing gold reserves was a change from the earlier trend, where several international financial institutions and countries had been systematically selling their precious metal assets - the most notable instance of this being the United Kingdom's liquidation of a significant portion of its gold reserves in the late 90s. Which Industry Uses The Most Gold?According to World Gold Council data for gold consumption by country, the jewelry manufacturing industry uses the most gold. So much so that 63% (2,086 metric tons) of total global gold consumption by industry is funneled into jewelry making and fabrication. The jewelry industry's preference for gold is based on the metal's resistance to tarnish, malleability, and symbolic associations with opulence. Story continuesFollowing the jewelry industry, gold bars and coins also contribute to the highest gold consumption in the world. In these forms, gold functions predominantly as a hedge against economic instability, and an instrument for preserving wealth. How Much Gold Is Used Per Year Globally?The international demand for gold in 2022 amounted to 3,303 metric tons, which represents a resurgence post-pandemic in countries with the highest gold consumption by year. In 2020, the world's total gold consumption dropped to 2,301 metric tons, the lowest since 2010, owing to the economic halt in most countries. The main companies in the gold sector are Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO), Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD), and Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), among others. The Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO) is a London-based mining giant that explores, mines and processes mineral sources. The primary mineral sources that Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO) mines and processes are gold, diamond, and copper, among many others. Likewise, the Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD) is a mining stakeholder based in Toronto, Canada. Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD) explores and produces precious metals in 13 countries and focuses on high-margin products.The largest gold company is Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), which is based in Denver, Colorado. Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) has a current market cap of $33.84 billion.We have extensively covered the 10 Best Gold Stocks to Buy for Portfolio Diversification; give them a read to make wise financial decisions. Which Is The Biggest Purchaser Of Gold?The biggest single buyer of gold are the central banks in the world's leading economies,  such as the Federal Reserve in the United States, the People's Bank of China, and the Central Bank of India, which have continued to maintain and enhance their gold reserves. The central banks procure gold to diversify their reserves, manage risk, and strengthen economic stability. According to the World Gold Council, central banks' net purchases reached 1,136 metric tons in 2022, whose worth was estimated to be $70 billion. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) data shows that the United States maintained the largest gold reserve globally, with approximately 261.5 million troy ounces, followed by Germany and then the International Monetary Fund itself.Without further ado, let's head over to the list of countries with the highest gold consumption by year:20 Countries With Highest Gold Consumption By Year20 Countries With Highest Gold Consumption By YearOur Methodology We ranked the top 20 countries with the highest gold consumption by year based on their annual gold demand in ascending order. The Gold Demand Trends Full Year 2022 report by World Gold Council covers countries' annual gold demand. We used countries' gold demand as a proxy for their gold consumption since credible data on individual countries' gold usage was limited. We also discussed some countries' per capita gold consumption to put their average demand in perspective. However, the per capita figures may slightly vary based on the time they were calculated and the said country's population numbers used by the source. For ranking the countries, we averaged-out their gold consumption for three years leading up to 2022.Based on the finding of the World Gold Council's annual report, here are 20 Countries With the Highest Gold Consumption By Year:20. MexicoAverage Per Year Gold Consumption: 14 metric tons  Gold Consumption In 2022: 14.6 metric tons Gold Consumption in 2021: 14.1 metric tons Gold Consumption in 2020: 13.3 metric tonsAccording to our findings based on the World Gold Council report of countries with the highest gold consumption by year, Mexico's annual average gold consumption is 14 metric tons. Mexico's per capita gold consumption stood at 0.11 grams. Mexico's main gold consumption was in jewelry manufacturing, which reached slightly over 13 metric tons in 2022, followed by 1.5 metric tons in gold bars and coins. 19. Kuwait Average Per Year Gold Consumption: 16.16 metric tons  Gold Consumption In 2022: 18.9 metric tons Gold Consumption in 2021: 16.6 metric tons Gold Consumption in 2020: 13 metric tonsKuwait's annual consumption of gold is 16.16 metric tons, mostly because of the country's affinity towards gold jewelry. This figure, impressive on its own, becomes even more meaningful when viewed per capita as the country's per capita gold consumption is 3.80 grams, one of the highest in the world. 18. Canada Average Per Year Gold Consumption: 24.7 metric tons  Gold Consumption In 2022: 27.5 metric tons Gold Consumption in 2021: 26 metric tons Gold Consumption in 2020: 20.8 metric tonsCanada's average gold consumption is 24.7 metric tons per year, as per the World Gold Council. If we discuss per capita consumption, the average Canadian consumes 0.71 grams of gold annually. This reflects the integral role of gold in sectors like jewelry, investment, and technology and the country's relative affluence. 17. Australia Average Per Year Gold Consumption: 28.86 metric tons  Gold Consumption In 2022: 30.9 metric tons Gold Consumption in 2021: 28.7 metric tons Gold Consumption in 2020: 27 metric tons (approximately)Australia's gold consumption reached an average of 28.86 metric tons annually in 2022. Based on data on gold consumption by country in 2023 from the World Gold Council, this figure equates to a per capita gold usage of approximately 1.12 grams. 16. Egypt Average Per Year Gold Consumption: 31.8 metric tons  Gold Consumption In 2022: 38 metric tons Gold Consumption in 2021: 34.1 metric tons Gold Consumption in 2020: 23.3 metric tonsDespite an unstable economy and tough geopolitical situation, Egypt's average annual gold consumption is 31.8 metric tons. A major reason for such considerable gold consumption is the public's reliance on gold bars as savings. Moreover, the country's per capita gold consumption is approximately 0.36 grams which shows the cultural significance of gold in the nation's social fabric.15. United Kingdom Average Per Year Gold Consumption: 33.3 metric tons  Gold Consumption In 2022: 35.6 metric tons Gold Consumption in 2021: 34.8 metric tons Gold Consumption in 2020: 29.6 metric tonsThe United Kingdom is among the countries with the highest gold consumption by year. Its average annual gold consumption stands at 33.3 metric tons. The country's per capita consumption is 0.53 grams, which mirrors this trend on an individual level. Like other data on gold consumption by country 2023, the major gold consuming sectors in the UK are jewelry and gold bars/coins. Interestingly, the UK's gold usage in the form of gold bars and coins is higher than most other countries; in 2022, the country used 16.3 metric tons of gold for bars, biscuits and coins, among others.14.

But the more important aspect here is that UAE has the 2nd highest per capita gold consumption in the world that reaches 5.24 grams, just behind Switzerland. Such impressive gold usage indicates the UAE's strong purchasing power and the gold market's significance.12. Switzerland Average Per Year Gold Consumption: 43.4 metric tons  Gold Consumption In 2022: 43.7 metric tons Gold Consumption in 2021: 43.8 metric tons Gold Consumption in 2020: 42.9 metric tonsSwitzerland's average gold consumption is 43.4 metric tons per annum, impacted by the country's stable finance and jewelry sectors, both heavily reliant on gold.

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for General Dynamics Step By Step Through The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.62bUS$4.10bUS$4.33bUS$4.57bUS$4.72bUS$4.85bUS$4.97bUS$5.09bUS$5.21bUS$5.33bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x9Analyst x8Analyst x4Analyst x2Est @ 2.74%Est @ 2.55%Est @ 2.42%Est @ 2.33%Est @ 2.26% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3% US$3.4kUS$3.6kUS$3.5kUS$3.4kUS$3.3kUS$3.2kUS$3.0kUS$2.9kUS$2.8kUS$2.6k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$32bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$5.3b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.3%– 2.1%) = US$105bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$105b÷ ( 1 + 7.3%)10= US$52bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$84b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$212, the company appears quite undervalued at a 31% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at General Dynamics as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.871. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for General DynamicsStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Aerospace &amp; Defense market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.Significant insider buying over the past 3 months.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

Just as business activity and the shares of U.S.-centric casino gaming companies rebounded sharply once people felt comfortable to travel to Las Vegas and other U.S. regional gaming markets, we have felt that Macau business activity and the shares of Macau-centric casino gaming companies would follow in the footsteps of Las Vegas-centric and other U.S. gaming and lodging companies and inflect positively once people were permitted to travel to Macau more freely.China recently abandoned it’s Zero-COVID policy and removed travel restrictions in January 2023. We now believe both Wynn and Las Vegas Sands are well positioned to capitalize on China’s reopening.As of late 2022, business activity in Macau languished at only 10% to 15% of pre-pandemic levels compared to Las Vegas business activity which had already exceeded pre-pandemic levels.

The officials could not say where Zoetis had carried out its tests.Governments have increasingly considered vaccination in the past months to stem the spread of the virus, although some are resisting due to concerns it could hit exports to countries that have banned vaccinated poultry on fears infected birds could slip through the net.

(""Elliott""), which manages funds that have an investment of approximately $1 billion representing a more than 13% economic interest in NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NRG) (""NRG"" or the ""Company""), released a public letter today calling for a process to select a new CEO and to make enhancements to the Board of Directors at NRG.Under the current CEO, NRG has engaged in value-destructive M&amp;A and adopted a misguided home services strategy that the market has fully rejected. Since announcing the Vivint transaction, NRG’s stock has meaningfully declined every time management has made public statements that further emphasize its commitment to the home services strategy.In the letter, Elliott said NRG's recent half-measures, including the Investor Day, were ""wholly insufficient to remedy a deeply flawed strategy overseen by a leadership team unfit to execute."" Elliott noted that NRG agreeing ""to reduce growth investments to no more than 20% of NRG's excess free cash flow and to limit additional investment in Vivint"" constituted ""guardrails"" for the CEO, a concession, ""which never would have been made if Elliott had not published materials questioning the Company's direction."" Elliott stated that these guardrails ""limited continued investment in a bad strategy"" but clearly do not solve the fundamental issue around leadership of the Company. Given ""NRG's failure to uphold its promises to responsibly allocate capital in the past,"" Elliott wrote, investors do not find the Company's ""latest capital allocation commitments to be credible or the new capital allocation framework to be durable without management change and enhanced Board oversight.""The Company's recent actions, Elliott asserted, ""have served to make clear the true cause of the Company's underperformance: NRG's CEO has lost the confidence of the core investor base, and the Board lacks the will to make the right decision for the Company.""Story continuesIn its letter, Elliott urged the Board to take the necessary steps to address the crisis of confidence in NRG's leadership, which include:1. Immediately announcing and commencing a search for a CEO from externally sourced candidates who have the relevant operating experience to drive high-performance operations;2. Working with Elliott to add highly qualified directors to the Board who possess relevant experience in the power and energy sectors and can credibly guide the Company toward becoming a best-in-class operator; and3. Initiating a comprehensive business review, as outlined in Elliott's May 15 presentation. Elliott believes a significant opportunity exists to improve the Company's cost performance, refocus on its core businesses and increase capital return to shareholders.Elliott concluded its letter stating that it ""believes there is a readily actionable path to create more than $5 billion of value at NRG; however, it is clear that the realization of this value will require management and Board changes. We look forward to seeing through the implementation of these steps.""The full letter and other materials are available at RepowerNRG.com. The full text of the letter follows:June 27, 2023NRG Energy, Inc.910 Louisiana StreetHouston, TX 77002Attn: Dr. Lawrence Coben, Chairman of the BoardDear Dr. Coben and Members of the Board,We write to you again on behalf of Elliott Associates, L.P. and Elliott International, L.P. (together, with their affiliates, ""Elliott"" or ""we"") to share our perspectives and our proposed path forward for NRG Energy, Inc. (""NRG"" or the ""Company"").We are investors in NRG because of our belief in the Company's potential to become a best-in-class integrated power company and create substantial shareholder value. As we have indicated, Elliott believes there is a readily achievable path to create more than $5 billion of value at NRG. Following the publication of the Repower NRG Plan on May 15, we had hoped to find common ground with you on the causes for NRG's profound undervaluation and the actions needed to unlock the immense value-creation opportunity that we see at the Company. Unfortunately, the Company has instead chosen to announce a series of defensive half-measures – actions wholly insufficient to remedy a deeply flawed strategy overseen by a leadership team unfit to execute.These recent actions have served to make clear the true cause of the Company's underperformance: NRG's CEO has lost the confidence of the core investor base, and the Board lacks the will to make the right decision for the Company. All of the steps taken in the past few weeks – limiting the Company's ability to deploy capital wastefully, changing capital-allocation policy, and making non-specific promises to bring in more Board oversight – have confirmed that the Board is trying to put guardrails around a deficient leader. While the Board has been unwilling to acknowledge the Company's suboptimal leadership, its series of ""solutions"" will prove insufficient over time. Shareholders see it for what it is: a desperate attempt to prop up an underperforming CEO.We did not come to this conclusion lightly, but as we have relayed to you in our discussions, the right solution for what ails NRG must begin with the Board commencing a process to select a new CEO. This new CEO should be sourced from external candidates and possess the right qualifications and experience to enable the Company to reach its full potential. The balance of this letter lays out our significant concerns about the current CEO and the Board's oversight of management, concluding with our recommendation that the Board must act today to address the leadership problem at NRG.NRG's Recent Half-Measures Have Not Assuaged Investor ConcernsSince sending our presentation and letter to the Board on May 15, we have received feedback from dozens of former, current and prospective NRG investors, and there appears to be broad consensus that new management is necessary at NRG. Investors are deeply frustrated by the Company's poor operational performance and are highly skeptical of the home services strategy that the current CEO has championed. This frustration is reflected in the stock's deep and sustained underperformance over multiple years.This feedback has not been limited to Elliott's conversations with market participants. Following an extensive round of marketing meetings with investors, Bank of America published a note reflecting the same lack of confidence in NRG's management:""In our extensive investor conversations, it is apparent to us that NRG management has lost the support of a large share of the investor base."" – Bank of America, 6/7/2023[1]This erosion of trust, we believe, is partly the result of years of inadequate Board-level oversight; investors now question whether the Board that has enabled Mr. Gutierrez in his demonstrated pattern of value destruction can provide effective oversight on behalf of the Company's shareholders going forward.NRG's continuing undervaluation is a direct reflection of the market's continuing lack of confidence in management's ability to 1) prudently allocate capital over the long term and 2) execute operationally on a consistent basis. The Company's Investor Day presentation represented ""more of the same,"" reaffirming the status quo that has come to dominate the market's perception of NRG.NRG management has consistently broken its capital-allocation promisesManagement's articulation of the Company's ability to generate significant excess cash flow, and promises to return nearly its entire market value to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends over the course of three-to-five years is not new and is a commitment that investors have consistently heard from management since the Transformation Plan was first introduced in 2017. Consider the following direct quotes from NRG management on this matter:""After achieving our new target 3x net debt-to-EBITDA ratio, we expect the Transformation Plan to result in up to $6.3 billion in excess cash or capital available for allocation by 2020, with over 60% of this excess cash or approximately $4 billion expected in 2018."" – 2017 Transformation Plan Presentation, 7/12/17""The second scenario is around share buybacks. And if we were able to buy back our stock at the current share price, this would represent close to 80% of our market cap today, 80% in the next 5 years. I don't believe there are many businesses with the financial flexibility that we have. And we are absolutely committed to be excellent stewards of your capital."" – 2018 Investor Day, 3/27/18""Now if we were to put our $8 billion of excess cash into share buybacks, we would be buying back 80% of our market cap today. I don't believe there are many businesses with this sort of financial flexibility, and we are fully committed to being excellent stewards of your capital as we continue to evolve and execute our plan."" – Q1 2018 earnings call, 5/3/18""You can see in this scenario that over the next 5 years, we would generate over $8 billion of excess cash or 80% of our market cap, grow our annual free cash flow before growth by 50% and shrink our share count by 30%."" – Q3 2019 earnings call, 11/7/19""We expect to generate cash in excess of the financial needs of our business, almost equivalent to our current market capitalization over the next 4 years."" – 2021 Investor Day, 6/17/21NRG's promises at its recent Investor Day are no different:""We expect to return close to 100% of our current market cap in the next 5 years.""– 2023 Investor Day, 6/22/23If these statements were credible, NRG would have succeeded in retiring its entire market cap at some point in the six years since 2017, or in creating significant value for shareholders. But now, these promises ring hollow, and NRG shareholders' patience has not been rewarded: NRG's share price today is at the same level as it was five years ago.The reason for this is clear: NRG's management is not a disciplined allocator of capital and has always prioritized growth and M&amp;A over capital return. NRG's failure to uphold its promises to responsibly allocate capital in the past has caused investors to almost entirely dismiss its most recent commitments:""In fact, NRG put almost roughly [the] exact same number out in their 2018 analyst day but they only ended up doing half [of] that…there has been a chronic inability to get credit in the IPPs for consistent return of capital. Some of that is they've never just done it; they always get distracted with something else. 5 years is a long time and so we hope in the case of NRG [and] Vistra here they stay committed to the return of capital. History is kind of against them though because they generally have not."" – Wolfe ""Fleish on Fridays,"" 6/23/23NRG's previous capital allocation framework of 50% growth / 50% capital return has not served as an effective governor: Over the past three years, NRG has executed more than $9 billion of acquisitions (including Vivint) and repurchased less than $1 billion of stock. In light of the clear evidence to the contrary, investors will not find the latest capital allocation commitments to be credible or the new capital allocation framework to be durable without management change and enhanced Board oversight.2. NRG management has not met financial commitmentsNRG has also failed to meet its fundamental financial commitments, experiencing two consecutive years of meaningful earnings misses. In 2022, NRG missed its original EBITDA guidance by 16% whereas its closest peers each reported earnings in excess of original guidance. NRG's underperformance was driven by a number of company-specific operational issues, including outages at two of its key Texas power plants, which then called into question management's ability to manage the Company's core operations.Similarly, investors view with extreme skepticism management's ability to execute the new $150 million cost savings program. These doubts are well founded – there is little evidence that alleged savings from previous cost reduction programs have resulted in sustainable and auditable reductions in operating expenses, or translated into real earnings uplift. Despite claims that it has realized $900 million of cost savings since 2016, NRG's total non-fuel cost structure as reported on its audited 2022 financial statements is the highest it has been since 2016 despite a 40% reduction in generation capacity and the alleged realization of nearly $300 million of Direct Energy synergies. While Elliott believes that there is a readily achievable opportunity for more than $500 million of EBITDA-accretive efficiencies at NRG, we have no confidence that current management will be able to execute on any cost savings program and drive sustainable incremental earnings.Furthermore, over time, NRG has changed its financial disclosures in a way that reduces transparency around the key performance metrics of its generation and retail businesses, including segment cost performance and unit margin performance. There is growing concern that the Vivint acquisition will provide another opportunity for management to further obfuscate the performance of the Company's underlying business segments. This is symptomatic of a management team that holds little investor credibility; high-performing management teams welcome transparency and scrutiny, while underperforming management teams seek to limit investor insight into the business.Our skepticism in management's ability to execute is shared widely among market participants. While the Investor Day highlights NRG's attractive financial profile, cash generation ability and discounted valuation, there is exceedingly low confidence that the current management team is capable of achieving the targets the Company has laid out:""The stock still trades at a 35%+ FCF yield on the 2025 outlook, well above peers and the company's historical levels. This is indicative to us that investors have low confidence in the ability of the company to achieve these targets - We think the 'show-me' aspect of the story is focused on the Vivint Smart Home business given the more challenging competitive backdrop, currently low FCF conversion, and growth tied to as-of-yet unproven cross selling initiatives."" – Morgan Stanley, 6/23/23""The Analyst Day once again lacked any details on basic business drivers like margins, volumes, or business segment contributions. Mgmt. wasn't even sure if Vivint would be a new segment or intermingled. We think this reduces accountability and makes it harder to buy into a 5-year outlook, especially after hiccups in recent years."" – Wolfe, 6/22/233. The ""Gutierrez Guardrails"" plan does not address the root cause of NRG's issuesUnder the current CEO, NRG has engaged in value-destructive M&amp;A and adopted a misguided home services strategy. Since announcing the Vivint transaction, NRG's stock has meaningfully declined every time management has made public statements that further emphasize its commitment to the home services strategy:See NRG Stock Price image.By contrast, at the Company's recent Investor Day, NRG agreed to reduce growth investments to no more than 20% of NRG's excess free cash flow and to limit additional investment in Vivint. This concession – which never would have been made if Elliott had not published materials questioning the Company's direction – received a mildly positive response from the market because it limited continued investment in a bad strategy. NRG's market value remains nearly $2 billion below levels prior to the Vivint transaction, and NRG's trading multiple remains lower than at any point in recent history.To be clear, the Investor Day has not changed investors' perspectives on the Company's home services wager. The skepticism of the strategy was never borne out of a misunderstanding of Vivint or a lack of information, but rather a clear-eyed appreciation for the execution risk embedded within management's plan. The lack of further funding for the Vivint experiment, however, provided investors with some relief from management in its quest to commit ever-increasing amounts of capital to home services.Overall, the response to the Investor Day was muted and failed to translate into robust enthusiasm for the NRG story, because most of the investors with whom we have spoken see the ""Gutierrez Guardrails"" plan for what it is: a means of buying time for an underperforming CEO in the hopes that these deeper investor concerns about strategy and credibility will somehow vanish. Based on our experience, these concerns will not fade, but instead will grow stronger. After engaging with scores of other companies facing the same or similar issues, our experience is that such measures almost never work. Investors too clearly see what NRG's current CEO wants to do (speculative M&amp;A) versus what he has no passion for (operational excellence and capital return).In addition, the Board should not underestimate the amount of management time and distraction the continued pursuit of the challenged Vivint strategy will entail. Investors understand where managers prioritize their time, and if management focus and attention is not directed toward optimizing the core business, the result will be more underperformance. Long-time followers of the NRG story saw this dynamic play out with NRG's previous CEO. Indeed, we have seen countless situations in our decades of active equity investing where companies and boards have allowed the inertia of a failed acquisition to create a drag on performance for years.Eventually, however, the evidence becomes too overwhelming to ignore, and the boards of these companies must bring in new management to reset priorities and fix the mistake. There is no justification for the Board to let years go by before acting. NRG's current management has lost the confidence of the Company's shareholders, and the solution to the problem is clear, as we set forth below.Next StepsThe Company is once again at an important crossroads – it can either knowingly choose to once again put investors' capital in the hands of the current CEO, who over the past seven years has failed to deliver on NRG's financial and capital-allocation commitments, or it can entrust the Company to a new management team with a track record of capital discipline and high-performance operations. For investors, the right choice could not be clearer.To that end, we call on the Board to take the following measures to address the crisis of confidence in NRG's leadership:1. Immediately announce and commence a search for a CEO from externally sourced candidates who have the relevant operating experience to drive high-performance operations.2. Work with Elliott to add highly qualified directors to the Board who possess relevant experience in the power and energy sectors and can credibly guide the Company toward becoming a best-in-class operator.3. Initiate a comprehensive business review. As outlined in our May 15 presentation, we believe a significant opportunity exists to improve the Company's cost performance, refocus on its core businesses and increase capital return to shareholders.As we have indicated, Elliott believes there is a readily actionable path to create more than $5 billion of value at NRG; however, it is clear that the realization of this value will require management and Board changes. We look forward to seeing through the implementation of these steps.Sincerely,John Pike                                 Bobby Xu                             Partner                                     Portfolio ManagerAbout ElliottElliott Investment Management L.P. manages approximately $55.2 billion of assets as of December 31, 2022.

""Home prices peaked in June 2022, declined until January 2023, and then began to recover.  The National Composite rose by 1.3% in April (repeating March's performance), and now stands only 2.4% below its June 2022 peak.  Our 10- and 20-City Composites both gained 1.7% in April.Story continues""The ongoing recovery in home prices is broadly based.  Before seasonal adjustments, prices rose in all 20 cities in April (as they had also done in March).  Seasonally adjusted data showed rising prices in 19 cities in April (versus 14 in March).""On a trailing 12-month basis, the National Composite is 0.2% below its April 2022 level, with the 10- and 20-City Composites also negative on a year-over-year basis, but regional differences continue to be striking.  Miami's 5.2% gain made it the best-performing city for the ninth consecutive month, but in April Chicago toddled into second place with a 4.1% gain.  Atlanta (+3.5%) and Charlotte (+3.4%) round out the top four.  The next three positions are occupied by New York, Cleveland, and then perennial medalist Tampa, indicating a remarkable diversity among the top performers.  At the other end of the scale, however, the worst eight performers are all in the Mountain or Pacific time zones, with Seattle (-12.4%) and San Francisco (-11.1%) at the bottom.  The Southeast (+3.6%) continues as the country's strongest region, while the West (-6.9%) remains the weakest.""If I were trying to make a case that the decline in home prices that began in June 2022 had definitively ended in January 2023, April's data would bolster my argument.  Whether we see further support for that view in coming months will depend on the how well the market navigates the challenges posed by current mortgage rates and the continuing possibility of economic weakness.""Table 1 below shows the housing boom/bust peaks and troughs for the three composites along with the current levels and percentage changes from the peaks and troughs.2006 Peak2012 TroughCurrentIndexLevelDateLevelDateFrom Peak (%)LevelFrom Trough(%)From Peak(%)National184.61Jul-06134.00Feb-12-27.4 %301.05124.7 %63.1 %20-City206.52Jul-06134.07Mar-12-35.1 %307.43129.3 %48.9 %10-City226.29Jun-06146.45Mar-12-35.3 %320.87119.1 %41.8 %Table 2 below summarizes the results for April 2023.

Now, the tables have turned, and an anti-ESG movement is gaining power on Wall Street. If you want to ride that wave, it is time to consider anti-woke stocks.Essentially, anti-ESG groups want companies to avoid prioritizing ESG initiatives. In 2023, these groups have already filed 68 proposals related to this thinking… and Axios reports that companies now want to avoid ESG. In fact, one climate-focused insurance alliance has continued to see insurers bail as the backlash grows.With ESG investing on the outs, that creates a real “in” opportunity with anti-woke stocks. Here are three worth your attention right now:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOccidental Petroleum (OXY)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Occidental Petroleum website.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comAs one of the largest oil producers in the U.S., Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) ranks among the anti-woke stocks. It comes down to politics. According to a relatively recent Gallup poll, a staggering 71% of Republican voters stated they would never purchase an electric vehicle.Another reason why OXY ranks among the stocks benefitting from ESG backlash is scientific reality. While Democrats promise an electrified future, the current grid apparently can’t handle too many air conditioners running simultaneously.But somehow, the grid can handle everyone charging EVs? I don’t think so. Thus, OXY makes perfect sense, whether you want to invest in the anti-woke trend or not.Newmont (NEM)Newmont logo on a mobile phone screenSource: Piotr Swat/ShutterstockPrecious metal miner Newmont (NYSE:NEM) aligns perfectly with the ESG backlash that’s storming through American society right now. Fundamentally, Newmont’s case comes down to addressing hypocrisy.Generally, it’s probably not a stretch to assume that people don’t like the idea of slaughterhouses. At the same time, that filet mignon had to come from somewhere. It didn’t just materialize like that on your plate. And it’s the same principle with Newmont. Nobody wants to think about the horrible environmental impact and social inequities stemming from gold mining. But folks sure do like their shiny jewelry!Story continuesAnd it’s not just jewelry. That computer, phone or tablet that you’re using to read this article uses precious metals. It’s quite possible that the extraction process involved in getting those metals was not environmentally or socially friendly.Therefore, NEM ranks among the top stocks benefitting from ESG backlash. Because whether you want to invest in the anti-woke trend or not, Newmont might be permanently relevant.Tyson Foods (TSN)Tyson (TSN Stock) chicken in a package.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comListed in the holdings of the God Bless America ETF (NYSEARCA:YALL), Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) might not initially seem like a beneficiary of an ideologically motivated movement. Then again, Tyson does the chop-chop. Ranking among the world’s largest food companies and a recognized leader in animal protein, its business is certainly not for the faint of heart.However, the food that people throughout the world enjoy must come from somewhere. It’s an ugly job, but Tyson’s willing to do it.Adding to its “street cred” as one of the stocks to buy amid ESG backlash, Tyson successfully defended itself against a lawsuit that alleged seven employees contracted Covid-19 due to the company’s lax pandemic mitigation protocols.It does have a soft spot though. Per its website, Tyson offers plant-based meat products. So, it’s not full-on anti-ESG.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Foreign tourists can then pay with WeChat when traveling in mainland China.This comes after Mastercard announced last week that cardholders can link credit or debit cards to the Alipay digital wallet where they can finally “pay like a local”. Alipay is the mobile payment app owned by Ant.China’s mobile payment network became highly closed-off to overseas tourists since mobile apps became the predominant payment method in the country in the late 2010s, triggering a boom in ecommerce. Foreign visitors often find themselves unable to pay for things in China where many shops and restaurants now only accept mobile payment rather than credit cards or cash.Prior to the easy card linkage change, foreigners in China typically needed to set up a Chinese bank account to access Tencent’s and Ant’s mobile payment networks.Tencent and Ant had formed partnerships with Visa and Mastercard in 2019 to make foreign cards usable on their platforms. But as China closed its borders during the COVID-19 pandemic and international arrivals to the country plummeted, such initiatives had taken a back seat, two people familiar with the matter said.However, the plans have regained momentum as China began reopening this year. Under the new setup, international travelers can set up their foreign cards on these apps with a few simple steps.To be sure, Tencent’s and Ant’s partnerships with Visa and Mastercard in 2019 already allowed some overseas users to use their credit cards in China but at the time only select businesses were allowed to process international credit cards. Now, Tencent and Ant are opening up their entire ecosystems to foreign cards, allowing visitors to pay for a host of goods and services ranging from a quick meal at a food truck to life insurance.Story continues“Our efforts to further open payment services to visitors coincide with the full resumption of travel and tourism to China, as well as major upcoming international events in the country scheduled this year,” Tencent said in a statement on Wednesday.Overseas tourists including those from Hong Kong and Macau spent US$131 billion in mainland China in 2019, before the onset of the pandemic.Visa and Mastercard have not replied to Reuters’ requests for comments.While China’s mobile payment networks have been closed off to foreign-issued credit cards, domestically issued credit cards under Visa and Mastercard have long been supported.(Reporting by Josh Ye; Editing by Kim Coghill)]"

The amount remained unchanged sequentially. The dividend will be paid on Aug 9, 2023, to stockholders of record as of Jul 7, 2023.This will mark the third quarterly cash dividend payment of 57 cents per share and a year-over-year increase of 16.3%. Going by the trend and the company’s solid operations, more shareholder-friendly moves are likely to come in the following days. It has a lower-than-industry dividend yield, leaving high dividend growth prospects.Let’s delve deeper.Based on the closing price of $377.42 per share on Jun 26, the stock has a dividend yield of 0.6%, which is lower than the industry average of 0.8%. In the first quarter, it paid $545 million in dividends. Also, in the first quarter, MA bought back 8 million shares for $2.9 billion. It had $8.7 billion remaining under its share buyback program as of Apr 24, 2023. Its strong financial position enables it to take shareholder-friendly moves.In the trailing 12-month period, its free cash flow grew 0.8% to $10.2 billion. Mastercard exited the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $6.6 billion, which stands way higher than the current portion of long-term debt ($276 million). Given its prudent operations, its financial strength is likely to grow more in the future.The economic volatility is expected to decrease in the coming days as conditions improve, which will enable MA to maintain its momentum. The high inflation environment had somewhat held back spending growth and as the inflationary pressures are expected to diminish going forward, massive opportunities will come for companies like Mastercard.The cross-border volume growth is expected to continue supporting MA’s operations. The metric jumped 35% year over year (on a local currency basis) in the first quarter. Gross dollar volume or GDV was $2,108 billion in the first quarter, up 15% year over year on a local-currency basis. Our estimate for total GDV for 2023 indicates a nominal year-over-year jump of 4.6%, which will further support its top-line growth.Story continuesPrice MovementsShares of Mastercard have gained 14.8% in the past year compared with the industry’s 4.8% rise.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksMastercard currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 75% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of QUALCOMM. View our latest analysis for QUALCOMM ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About QUALCOMM?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.QUALCOMM already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of QUALCOMM, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in QUALCOMM. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.9% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.5% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.4% of the company stock.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of QUALCOMMThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of QUALCOMM Incorporated. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$159m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 25% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand QUALCOMM better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for QUALCOMM (1 doesn't sit too well with us!) that you should be aware of before investing here.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

Source: Visit FloridaBooking.com is rolling out an AI Trip Planner to U.S. members of its Genius travel rewards program on its mobile app starting Wednesday, the company announced.The company said the trip planner uses OpenAI’s ChatGPT as its foundation, as well as its own AI tools, rather than the rival Google Bard. That choice is somewhat surprising given Booking’s long relationship with Google, which counts Booking as one of its largest travel advertisers. On the other hand, critics have widely held Open AI’s ChatGPT in higher regard than Google Bard.Like Booking rival Expedia’s ChatGPT feature, Booking said its own AI Trip Planner, which is in beta, will entertain questions from travelers about destinations and accommodations.“Travelers can go back and forth between their chat with the AI Trip Planner and the Booking.com app interface as they consider options for their trip,” Booking’s announcement stated. “With just a tap on any accommodation they are interested in, they can complete the reservation, as the AI Trip Planner is directly integrated into the accommodation booking experience in the Booking.com app.”We haven’t actually tried Booking’s AI Trip Planner yet, and tomorrow’s release will be in beta with a limited set of users initially. So it’s tough to do a comparison with Expedia’s ChatGPT-based virtual assistant.Expedia’s chatbot doesn’t include pricing information or booking links. But travelers can save a chat, and they get redirected to the Expedia iOS app’s Trip’s feature, where they can begin the booking process.“Our primary aim at Booking.com has always been to leverage technology to make travel easier,” said Glenn Fogel, CEO of parent company Booking Holdings and Booking.com. “The recent developments with generative AI are accelerating the work we’ve been doing for years with machine learning to enhance and improve every aspect of the customer experience on our platform, whether it’s optimizing the right order to display a hotel’s photos to surfacing the most relevant reviews.

Kennedy (CVN 79) aircraft carrier. The awards have been offered by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C.The contracts, worth $393.2 million, are projected to be completed by Jul 31, 2025. Per the terms of the deals, Huntington Ingalls will be responsible for improving capability at ship delivery, defining unpriced change orders, and providing engineering and integrated logistics support for Pre-Commissioning Unit John F. Kennedy (CVN 79) aircraft carrier.Work related to these contracts will be carried out in Newport News, VA.Aircraft Carriers &amp; Huntington IngallsHuntington Ingalls’ Newport News unit is an expert in engineering, design and construction of U.S. Navy nuclear aircraft carriers (CVN). These CVNs are the largest ships in the U.S. Navy's fleet, with a displacement of more than 90,000 tons.The unit has designed and built the first next generation ship — Gerald R. Ford class (CVN 78) aircraft carriers — and over 31 aircraft carriers for the U.S. Navy since 1933, including all 10 Nimitz class (CVN 68) aircraft carriers currently in service.It continues to be the exclusive prime contractor for nuclear aircraft carrier refueling and complex overhaul (RCOH), with Huntington Ingalls being the sole designer and builder of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. Newport News is currently performing the RCOH of USS George Washington (CVN 73) and USS John C. Stennis (CVN 74).The aforementioned discussion reflects the solid position that Huntington Ingalls already enjoys in the nuclear aircraft carrier market. The company witnesses a strong inflow of contracts involving the production, RCOH and related support for CVNs. The latest contract wins are a bright example of that, taking HII a step closer to the scheduled delivery of CVN 79 in 2025.Looking AheadNations are strengthening their defense capabilities amid rising geopolitical tensions. In this context, demand for military ships that boast the features of next-generation technology-based warfare capabilities, has been gaining momentum. This is due to the system’s growing importance in military missions.Per a report from Mordor Intelligence, the aircraft carrier ship market is projected to witness a CAGR of more than 2% during 2023-2028. Such solid growth trends indicate ample growth opportunities for Huntington Ingalls, as it enjoys the lucrative position of a prominent aircraft carrier in the aforementioned market.A few defense primes that can gain from the expanding aircraft carrier market are General Dynamics GD, BAE Systems BAESY and Lockheed Martin LMT.Story continuesGeneral Dynamics’ NASSCO-Norfolk, a consolidation of two great shipyards, is a Master Ship Repair contractor providing high-quality and cost-effective maintenance and modernization for the U.S. Navy. With facilities in Bremerton, WA, in the Pacific Northwest, GD holds experience in more than 450 ships, a Master Ship Repair Agreement contract, and the maintenance and repair of aircraft carriers from the Navy's amphibious fleet.GD boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Dynamics’ 2023 sales indicates an improvement of 5% from the 2022 reported figure.BAE Systems designs and manufactures naval ships as well as state-of-the-art combat systems and equipment supporting those warships. The company played a key role in the design and construction of the Queen Elizabeth Class Aircraft Carriers, the largest warship in the United Kingdom. It also provides management and delivery of planned overseas support to the Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier.BAESY boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 13.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 sales indicates growth of 24.8% from the previous year’s reported number.Lockheed’s Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program Block 2 systems are used to upgrade warships like aircraft carriers’ electronic warfare capabilities so that warfighters can respond to evolving threats. The company also offers upgrade to the AN/SLQ-32 systems on U.S. aircraft carriers to determine if the electronic sensors of its potential foes are tracking the ship.LMT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.2%.

Other pockets of the market are working as well,"" Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.The SPDR S&amp;P Homebuilder ETF (XHB), which focuses on the US homebuilding industry, rose as much as 28.2% for the year, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 Index's 12.7% gain, according to a research note from DataTrek. It also closed at a new 52-week high on Tuesday.""Can a US recession really be just around the corner if homebuilding stocks just made a new high today?"" he asked. ""The short answer to the query posed above is 'no, obviously not.'""The file photo, workers construct new Pulte homes in Mesa, Ariz. PulteGroup, Inc. (AP Photo/Matt York, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Additionally, Colas noted, homebuilding stocks ""remain cheap to the market.""For instance, the average valuation of the fund's top 10 holdings based on forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate is 14.6x, compared with the S&amp;P 500 at 18.6x, Colas noted. That includes such homebuilders as PulteGroup (PHM) at 8.6x, Lennar (LEN) at 9.9x, D.R. Horton (DHI) at 12.2x, and NVR (NVR) at 15.6x.One big reason for the optimism for homebuilders — and among them — is the limited housing supply, Colas wrote, especially in the resale market. Homeowners have been reluctant to sell their homes and swap their low rates on their current mortgages for ones that are twice as high.As a result, buyers frustrated by the lack of choices among previously-owned homes are flocking to the new home market. In May, new home sales jumped 12.2% to a seasonally adjusted rate of 763,000 units from April, the government reported Tuesday. That was also up 20% from a year ago.Builders have responded by accelerating their development plans. In May, a strong housing starts print showed new construction of both single and multi-family units jumped 21.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.631 million units.Story continuesCitigroup analysts led by Anthony Pettinari wrote in a note to clients on Monday that current shortages in housing “may provide a multi-year tailwind for builders.”Builders foreshadowed this swing in fortunes in their latest earnings calls where they credited steady demand, tight resale inventory, and cooling price inflation on building materials for beating expectations and rosier outlooks.Colas echoed all these advantages in his note, along with the slowing of interest-rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.“And, if the Fed really is near the end of their current tightening cycle, then interest rates should decline in 2024 and beyond and support demand over the longer term,” Colas wrote.—Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Check Out These 2 Medical Names,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-stocks-positive-earnings-momentum-130007044.html,1687870807,STORY,['BAX'],"[Quarterly financial reports play a vital role on Wall Street, as they help investors see how a company has performed and what might be coming down the road in the near-term. And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Baxter International (BAX) earns a Zacks Rank #3 30 days from its next quarterly earnings release on July 27, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.61 a share.Baxter International's Earnings ESP sits at 0.99%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.61 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.60.BAX is part of a big group of Medical stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Abbott (ABT) as well.Abbott, which is readying to report earnings on July 19, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $1.04 a share, and ABT is 22 days out from its next earnings report.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Abbott is $1.04, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 0.21%.Story continuesBAX and ABT's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. See our latest analysis for Johnson &amp; Johnson The MethodWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$23.6bUS$25.8bUS$27.1bUS$28.1bUS$29.0bUS$29.8bUS$30.6bUS$31.3bUS$32.0bUS$32.7bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x8Analyst x7Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 2.73%Est @ 2.54%Est @ 2.41%Est @ 2.32%Est @ 2.26% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% US$22.1kUS$22.6kUS$22.2kUS$21.5kUS$20.8kUS$20.0kUS$19.2kUS$18.4kUS$17.6kUS$16.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$201bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$33b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.1%) = US$704bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$704b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$362bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$564b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$163, the company appears about fair value at a 19% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Johnson &amp; Johnson as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Johnson &amp; JohnsonStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Pharmaceuticals market.Shareholders have been diluted in the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatDividends are not covered by earnings.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For Johnson &amp; Johnson, we've put together three fundamental elements you should look at:Risks: We feel that you should assess the 5 warning signs for Johnson &amp; Johnson we've flagged before making an investment in the company.Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for JNJ's future outlook?

The Institute of Supply Management (ISM) reported that manufacturing PMI (purchasing managers’ index) came in at 46.9 in May. Notably, any reading below 50 indicates a contraction in manufacturing activities.This marked the sixth consecutive month of contraction in U.S. manufacturing activities after 30 months of expansion. The sub-indexes for new orders, production and backlog of orders remained below 50. Demand remains weak in the face of a higher interest rate regime adopted by the Fed and concerns about a near-term recession.However, not all manufacturing industries are suffering from demand shortages. The mining and construction industry and the farm equipment industry are doing well, defying the above-mentioned headwinds.Strong Demand for Mining and ConstructionThe intensifying global focus on shifting from fossil fuels to zero emissions will require a large number of commodities, which, in turn, will support demand for mining equipment in the years to come. The U.S. government's plans to increase investment in infrastructure construction, particularly in critical subsectors, such as transportation, water and sewerage, and telecommunications, should support demand in the coming years.The industry participants are investing in digital initiatives like AI, cloud computing, advanced analytics and robotics. Digital transformation aids organizations in boosting productivity and increasing efficiency, reliability and safety, thereby enriching customer satisfaction. With the pressing need to cut carbon emissions, companies worldwide are relying more on autonomous machinery.Solid Demand for Farm EquipmentGrowing demand for food to sustain the farm equipment industry and the need to replace aging equipment should spur demand. Farm size has been on the rise in the United States, which calls for more laborers. Given the escalation in labor costs every year, farmers are resorting to equipment to replace labor. Demand for agricultural equipment will continue to be supported by increased global demand for food, both from population growth and an increasing proportion of the population aspiring for better living standards.Story continuesCustomers are increasingly relying on advanced technology, smart farming solutions and mechanization to run their operations. Thus, industry participants are enhancing investments in launching products equipped with advanced technologies and features to keep up with customers' evolving demands.Initiatives to advance precision agriculture technology is likely to be a game-changer for the industry players, given its productivity-enhancing and sustainability benefits. Demand continues to grow for popular features, which include automatic guide machines in the field and equipment that plants seeds, and applies chemicals and fertilizers with exceptional accuracy.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five industrial products stocks.

The space has witnessed a total return of (9.7%) in 2023 so far against the S&amp;P 500’s gain of around 12.7%.With investors dumping risky assets in the wake of concerns about a slowing global economy, oil has broken below $70, while natural gas is trading under $3 on the expectation of comfortable temperatures and, therefore, lighter heating or cooling demand.Given the current state of affairs in the energy sector, it seems a wise investment strategy to search for stocks that provide a solid level of defense and often come paired with dividend payouts. A group of stocks that fulfill these criteria are the large caps — defined as companies with a market capitalization of $10 billion or more.The Williams Companies WMB, Phillips 66 PSX and Canadian Natural Resources CNQ should be on the watchlist of investors seeking large-cap energy exposure.Why Large Caps?These companies possess strong financial positions, established reputations, and enjoy extensive analyst coverage. Moreover, their consistent dividend payments make them popular among income-oriented investors. Investors seeking reliability and a solid track record will find these large-cap companies appealing.While these may offer less growth potential compared to their smaller counterparts, they compensate with a lower level of price volatility.

You can skip our detailed analysis, and head directly to the 10 Poorest Cities in Every State in the US.The United States is divided by its glaring income inequality, with slices of wealthy groups coexisting with pockets of poverty affected population across the country. Figures released by the U.S. Census Bureau stated the nationwide poverty rate at 11.6% in 2021, with nearly 38 million people living below the poverty line - $27,479 for a family of four.

You can read more about this in our article, 30 Richest Cities in the United States. Much of their wealth is due to the presence of big corporations in these cities. For example, American multinational financial services company Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) is based in San Francisco. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) was founded by William Boeing in 1916 in Seattle and the city’s office served as the headquarters of the company until 2001 when The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) moved the headquarters to Chicago.When it comes to states, California is the richest state in the United States, having a GDP of over $3.5 trillion – close to the size of India’s economy.

They also lagged some upbeat market forecasts, which included at least 30 orders expected by JPMorgan analysts.Investors were especially disappointed by the lack of orders from the booming Indian airline market, which handled an all-time high 500-plane transaction to Airbus and new orders to Boeing.""Given the significant announcements from Airbus, it's possible that Embraer shareholders feel frustrated,"" noted BTG Pactual analysts, who also have a ""buy"" recommendation for shares in the planemaker.SLOW BUT LUCRATIVEStill, a number of analysts remain bullish on the Brazilian company as a post-pandemic travel rebound continues to drive money inflow in the sector.BTG said it was important to note the sales to existing clients Binter and American Airlines were equivalent to 19% of Embraer's outlook of 65-70 deliveries this year, making them ""significant deals"".Those orders add to a backlog that remains robust, with the E2 aircraft seen as largely sold out for this year and 2024 after garnering new customers such as Royal Jordanian, Salam Air and Scoot recently.Story continuesDespite the overall slow pace of deals at the air show, investment research firm Zacks still touted them as ""lucrative"" and ""highlighting the reliability and efficiency this jetliner offers"".Other upbeat takes from the air show came from electric aircraft subsidiary Eve, which signed deals for the sale of up to 150 flying cars, as well as Embraer's deal to return to China by converting passenger jets into freighters.Shares in Embraer are still up 20% so far this year, and some analysts believe upside remains.""We believe that most of the pre-event excitement has already been adjusted in share prices,"" XP said. ""There is limited room for further pressure."" (Reporting by Gabriel Araujo; Editing by Conor Humphries)]"

The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Currently, DTE Energy has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Southern Co. has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).

The deal has been awarded by the U.S. Army.Valued at $712.3 million, the contract is an extension of a five-year contract the company clinched in 2020, with an extendable option for a sixth year. Per the deal, General Dynamics will deliver 300 Stryker DVHA1 combat vehicles to the U.S. Army.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?Nations have increased their defense spending on military equipment and various arsenals to strengthen their defense capabilities. The surge in the demand for defense products is primarily due to rising geopolitical tensions and amplified terrorist threats.Hence, combat vehicles equipped with varied offensive abilities form an integral part of any defense system. Buoyed by their defensive and offensive capabilities, combat vehicles have registered strong growth in demand and are likely to witness huge investments by nations to procure them.In such a scenario, General Dynamics’ Land Systems, the prime contractor of such remarkably efficient and technologically advanced combat vehicles, is likely to continue to witness a strong order inflow from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.Growth ProspectsPer the report from the Markets and Markets firm, the global armored vehicle market is projected to witness a CAGR of 3.1% during the 2022-2027 period. Such abounding growth trends indicate ample growth opportunities for General Dynamics as it enjoys a lucrative position in the production of combat vehicles.A few other defense primes that can reap the benefits of the aforementioned market growth prospects are BAE Systems BAESY, Northrop Grumman NOC and Raytheon Technologies RTX.BAE Systems’ Challenger 2 is heavily armored and highly mobile, designed for use in the direct fire zone. Its primary role is to destroy or neutralize the armor. It also has the ability to engage both hard and soft targets and can operate across a spectrum of high-intensity conflicts, counter insurgencies and peacekeeping roles.Story continuesThe long-term earnings growth rate of BAESY is projected at 13.7%. Shares of BAE Systems have rallied 19.7% in the past year.Northrop Grumman specializes in innovating low-cost, highly-reliable, precise weapons and ammunition for artillery and mortar systems, medium-caliber weapon platforms, battle tanks and individual soldiers.Northrop Grumman’s long-term earnings growth rate is projected at 3.8%. Shares of NOC have returned 2.3% value to investors in the past month.Raytheon, in collaboration with American Rheinmetall Vehicles, designed an infantry fighting vehicle, the Lynx OMFV Infantry Fighting Vehicle.

It still reaped the benefits of rival Adidas' disastrous breakup with the musician formerly known as Kanye West last quarter as well as demand for Jordan Retro and LeBron 20.Sales to wholesale customers, which made up nearly 58% of total Nike Brand revenues in fiscal 2022, have been on the decline as retailers cut back on orders and become more prudent due to a drop in discretionary spending among shoppers.In May, retailer Foot Locker, which has touted its 'renewed' relationship with Nike, also flagged declining sales, particularly for fashion-oriented sneakers.Barclays analysts noted Nike could see ""moderation, and potentially negative, wholesale channel growth"" in the fourth quarter.Still, analysts expect a stronger rebound in China to offset the hit to sales from cooling consumer appetite for higher margin products in the North American region and help retain its top spot as the world's leading sportswear brand.Story continuesTHE FUNDAMENTALS** Nike will report fourth-quarter earnings on June 29 after markets close** Nike is expected to report fourth-quarter revenue of $12.59 billion, a 2.9% rise from a year earlier, according to analysts polled by Refinitiv** Fourth-quarter profit per share is expected to be 67 cents** Analysts expect Nike's fiscal 2024 revenue to rise 6.4% to $54.23 billion and earnings per share to be $3.91WALL STREET SENTIMENT** Nike shares have risen nearly 3% in the last 12 months** The average rating of 38 analysts on Nike stock is ""buy"", with 24 rating it ""buy"" or higher - Refinitiv** The median price target is $135(Reporting by Ananya Mariam Rajesh in Bengaluru; Editing by Krishna Chandra Eluri)]"

Ravi Thanawala joining Papa John’s from Nike shows how CFOs can add value regardless of industry,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trading-sneakers-pizza-ravi-thanawala-104828966.html,1687862908,STORY,"['NKE', 'PZZA']","[Good morning.Companies are increasingly looking more at the overall skill sets of CFO candidates rather than whether those individuals have sector-specific experience, according to experts. One example? Ravi Thanawala.Papa John’s International (Nasdaq: PZZA), one of the largest pizza delivery companies with more than 5,700 restaurants in approximately 50 countries and territories, announced on Monday that Thanawala will join as CFO on July 24. Thanawala is currently CFO for Nike North America, the retail giant’s largest division, which reported fiscal year 2022 revenue of approximately $18 billion.Thanawala began his tenure at Nike North America almost seven years ago and took over as CFO in 2020. He previously served as the global VP and CFO of the Converse brand, and the global VP of retail excellence. Before Nike, he served as CFO at ANN Inc., the parent company of Ann Taylor, LOFT, and Lou &amp; Grey. On his LinkedIn page, it shows his career began at Balenciaga as a wholesale intern.A lack of food industry-specific experience certainly didn't deter Papa John’s from pursuing Thanawala, who brings with him “a combination of strategic financial leadership experience, operational acumen, and international expertise,” CEO and President Rob Lynch said in a company statement. “Ravi’s proven track record of leading companies with diversified business models and robust e-commerce platforms will be key to enabling our continued growth through both our corporate-owned and franchisee-led restaurants.”'More transferable'I asked executive recruiting experts what they’re seeing regarding more companies choosing CFOs from different sectors.“CFO candidates have always been open and willing to explore new industries,” says Shawn Cole, executive recruiter and president of Cowen Partners, an executive search firm. “It was the companies that had reservations. And to a certain degree, CFO skill sets are becoming more transferable with technology adaptation, standardized ERPs, and FP&amp;A. However, not all experience is transferable, and you have to find common ground between industries, service delivery, business size, and complexity.”Story continuesThis trend, Cole continued, also “speaks to two things: a lack of qualified candidates with industry experience, and looking outside their industry for best practices in an uncertain economy/business environment."" He added: ""There are only so many quick-service restaurants for Papa John's to pull CFOs from, and it's only natural for them to look outside the industry for transferable skill sets.""“In general,"" says Jenna Fisher, managing director and head of the CFO practice at the global firm Russell Reynolds Associates, ""I see a correlation between the size of a company and agnosticism around industry. Broadly speaking, bigger companies have the luxury of having lots of people on the bench and lots of people with endemic knowledge about the industry at the company already. What tends to be the more salient data point—for larger companies in particular—is the functional skill set that a CFO brings to the table.""That said, there are notable exceptions like “biotech and financial services, in particular, that have a very unique alphabet soup that is distinct to those industries, and they tend to be less fungible from an industry standpoint,” Fisher added.So why did Thanawala choose Papa John’s? A company spokesperson said Thanawala wasn’t available for an interview. But in the announcement, he said Papa John’s has a “people-first culture, differentiated brand, and innovative mindset,” and “vast whitespace available for development in the U.S. and internationally.” Chris Collins, who served as the interim principal financial and accounting officer and finance team leader since March, will resume his role as VP of Tax and Treasury. Collins took on the interim role after Ann Gugino resigned as CFO in March.Ultimately, Fisher tells me, the fact more companies are considering CFO candidates without industry-specific experience is “also somewhat correlated to what we've seen in terms of a lot of first-time CFOs getting the nod: It’s enabling this kind of next-gen talent to emerge.""Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.comThis story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

But in recent years, some drugmakers have been focusing on long-acting growth hormones to improve patient convenience.Ngenla in a late-stage-study showed that the once-weekly injection was non-inferior compared to Pfizer's approved growth hormone Genotropin, which is for daily administration.The FDA was initially expected to make a decision on Ngenla by October 2021 but had pushed it back by three months after Pfizer submitted some additional data on the drug.With the latest approval of Ngenla, Pfizer will compete with Ascendis Pharma's once-weekly growth hormone injection, Skytrofa, which was approved by the FDA in 2021.Ngenla is already approved for treatment of pediatric GHD in more than 40 markets, including Canada, Japan, and countries in Europe.

(NYSE: PFE) and OPKO Health Inc. (NASDAQ: OPK) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved NGENLA (somatrogon-ghla), a once-weekly, human growth hormone analog indicated for treatment of pediatric patients aged three years and older who have growth failure due to inadequate secretion of endogenous growth hormone. NGENLA is expected to become available for U.S. prescribing in August 2023.Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) is a rare disease characterized by the inadequate secretion of the growth hormone somatropin from the pituitary gland, affecting one in approximately 4,000 to 10,000 children.1,2 Without treatment, children will have persistent growth attenuation, a very short height in adulthood, and puberty may be delayed.1,2,3 Children living with GHD may also experience challenges in relation to their physical health and mental well-being.1,2,3""For more than 30 years, Pfizer has been committed to supporting children and adults living with growth hormone deficiency, beginning with the delivery of a medicine that has long been a part of the standard of care,"" said Angela Hwang, Chief Commercial Officer, President, Global Biopharmaceuticals Business, Pfizer. ""We are excited to bring this next-generation treatment to patients in the United States, continuing our commitment to helping children living with this rare growth disorder reach their full potential.""The FDA approval is supported by results from a multi-center, randomized, open-label, active-controlled Phase 3 study which evaluated the safety and efficacy of NGENLA when administered once-weekly compared to once-daily somatropin. The study met its primary endpoint of NGENLA non-inferiority compared to somatropin, as measured by annual height velocity at 12 months. NGENLA was generally well tolerated in the study and had a safety profile comparable to somatropin.Story continues""The approval of NGENLA will be significant for children with growth hormone deficiency in the U.S. It holds potential to reduce the treatment burden that can come with daily growth hormone injections,"" said Joel Steelman, M.D., Pediatric Endocrinologist, Cook Children’s Health Care System. ""As a new, longer-acting option that has the ability to reduce treatment frequency from daily to weekly, NGENLA could become an important treatment option that can improve adherence for children being treated for growth hormone deficiency.""""Throughout our collaboration with Pfizer, we have worked tirelessly toward our shared goal of helping children living with growth hormone disease and their families,"" said Phillip Frost, M.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, OPKO Health. ""We are proud of the clinical development program that supported the FDA approval of NGENLA and are excited about its potential for these patients and their families as it becomes available in the United States.""NGENLA is approved for the treatment of pediatric GHD in more than 40 markets including Canada, Australia, Japan, and EU Member States.The full Prescribing Information can be found here. If it is not currently available via this link, it will be visible as soon as possible as we work to finalize the document. Please check back for the full information shortly.About NGENLA (somatrogon-ghla) InjectionNGENLA (somatrogon-ghla) is a human growth hormone that works by replacing the lack of growth hormone in the body. NGENLA is taken by injection just below the skin, administered via a device that allows for titration based on patient need. Compared to the growth hormone GENOTROPIN® (somatropin), its action in the body lasts longer, enabling weekly injections instead of daily.In 2014, Pfizer and OPKO entered into a worldwide agreement for the development and commercialization of NGENLA for the treatment of GHD. Under the agreement, OPKO is responsible for conducting the clinical program and Pfizer is responsible for registering and commercializing NGENLA for GHD.About the NGENLA Clinical ProgramThe safety and efficacy of NGENLA (somatrogon-ghla) was demonstrated in a multi-center, randomized, open-label, active-controlled Phase 3 study (NCT 02968004). The Phase 3 study enrolled and treated 224 pediatric patients, treatment-naïve children with growth hormone deficiency who were randomized 1:1 into two arms: NGENLA (somatrogon-ghla) once-weekly at a dose of 0.66 mg/kg/day vs somatropin, once-daily at a dose of 0.034 mg/kg/day. The study met its primary endpoint of NGENLA non-inferiority compared to somatropin, measured by annual height velocity at 12 months.About Growth Hormone DeficiencyGrowth hormone deficiency is a rare disease characterized by the inadequate secretion of growth hormone from the pituitary gland and affects one in approximately 4,000 to 10,000 children.1,2 In children, this disease can be caused by genetic mutations or acquired after birth.1,4 Because the patient's pituitary gland secretes inadequate levels of somatropin, the hormone that causes growth, a child’s height may be affected and puberty may be delayed.1,2,5 Without treatment, affected children will have persistent growth attenuation and a very short height in adulthood.1,2 Children may also experience challenges in relation to physical health and mental well-being.1,2Important NGENLA (somatrogon-ghla) Safety InformationGrowth hormone should not be used in children after the growth plates have closed.Growth hormone should not be used in children with some types of eye problems caused by diabetes (diabetic retinopathy).Growth hormone should not be used in children who have cancer or other tumors.Growth hormone should not be used in children who are critically ill because of some types of heart or stomach surgery, trauma, or breathing (respiratory) problems.Growth hormone should not be used in children with Prader-Willi syndrome who are very overweight or have breathing problems including sleep apnea.NGENLA should not be used by children who have had an allergic reaction to somatrogon-ghla or any of the ingredients in NGENLA. Look for prompt medical attention in case of an allergic reaction.Some children have developed diabetes mellitus while taking growth hormone. Dosages of diabetes medicines may need to be adjusted during treatment with NGENLA. Children should be watched carefully if NGENLA is given along with glucocorticoid therapy and/or other drugs that are processed by the body in the same way.In childhood cancer survivors, treatment with growth hormone may raise the likelihood of a new tumor, particularly some benign (non-cancerous) brain tumors. This likelihood may be higher in children who were treated with radiation to the brain or head. Your child’s health care provider will need to check your child for a return of cancer or a tumor.Children treated with growth hormone have had increased pressure in the brain. If your child has headaches, eye problems, nausea (feeling like you are going to be sick), or vomiting, contact your child’s health care provider.NGENLA may decrease thyroid hormone levels. Decreased thyroid hormone levels may change how well NGENLA works. Your child’s health care provider will do blood tests to check your child’s hormone levels.Children treated with growth hormone should be checked regularly for low serum cortisol levels and/or the need to increase the dose of the glucocorticoids they are taking.In children experiencing fast growth, curvature of the spine may develop or worsen. This is also called scoliosis. Children with scoliosis should be checked regularly to make sure their scoliosis does not get worse during their growth hormone therapy.Use a different area on the body for each injection. This can help to avoid skin problems such as lumpiness or soreness.Growth hormone treatment may cause serious and constant stomach (abdominal) pain. This could be a sign of pancreatitis. Tell your child’s health care provider if your child has any new stomach (abdominal) pain.In studies of NGENLA in children with GHD, side effects included injection site reactions such as pain, swelling, rash, itching, or bleeding. Other side effects were the common cold, headache, fever (high temperature), low red blood cells (anemia), cough, vomiting, decreased thyroid hormone levels, stomach pain, rash, or throat pain.A health care provider will help you with the first injection. He or she will also train you on how to inject NGENLA.Rx onlyAbout GENOTROPIN (somatropin)GENOTROPIN is a man-made, prescription treatment option. The indications GENOTROPIN is approved for vary by market. GENOTROPIN is approved for growth failure due to GHD and adult GHD, Prader-Willi Syndrome, Idiopathic Short Stature, Turner Syndrome, Small for Gestational Age (with no catch-up growth), and Chronic Renal Insufficiency. GENOTROPIN is taken by injection just below the skin and is available in a wide range of devices to fit a range of individual dosing needs. GENOTROPIN is just like the natural growth hormone that our bodies make and has an established safety profile.Important GENOTROPIN (somatropin) Safety InformationSomatropin should not be used for growth promotion in pediatric patients with closed epiphyses.Somatropin is contraindicated in patients with active proliferative or severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy.Somatropin is contraindicated in patients with active malignancy. Because growth hormone deficiency may be a sign of pituitary or other brain tumors, the presence of such tumors should be ruled out before treatment is initiated. Somatropin should not be used in patients with any evidence of progression or recurrence of an underlying intracranial tumor.Somatropin in pharmacologic doses should not be used to treat patients with acute critical illness due to complications from open heart surgery, abdominal surgery or multiple accidental traumas, or those patients with acute respiratory failure due to an increased mortality. The safety of continuing replacement somatropin treatment for approved uses in patients who develop these illnesses has not been established.Somatropin is contraindicated in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome who are severely obese or have respiratory impairment.GENOTROPIN is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to somatropin or any of its excipients. Serious systemic hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and angioedema have been reported with postmarketing use of somatropin products. Patients and caregivers should be informed that such reactions are possible and that prompt medical attention should be sought if an allergic reaction occurs.New-onset Type-2 diabetes mellitus has been reported. Monitor patients with glucose intolerance closely; dosage of antihyperglycemic drug may need to be adjusted. Monitor carefully if somatropin is administered in combination with glucocorticoid therapy and/or other drugs metabolized by the CP450 pathway.In childhood cancer survivors, an increased risk of a second neoplasm, in particular meningiomas, has been reported in patients treated with somatropin after their first neoplasm, particularly those who were treated with cranial radiation. Children with certain rare genetic causes of short stature have an increased risk of developing malignancies. Practitioners should thoroughly consider the risks and benefits of starting somatropin in these patients and if treatment is initiated, should carefully monitor these patients for development of neoplasms. Patients should be monitored carefully for any malignant transformation of skin lesions.Intracranial hypertension (IH) has been reported in a small number of patients treated with somatropin. If papilledema is observed during somatropin treatment, treatment should be stopped and reassessed. Patients with Turner syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome may be at increased risk for the development of IH.Undiagnosed/untreated hypothyroidism may prevent an optimal response to somatropin, in particular, the growth response in children. Patients with Turner syndrome have an inherently increased risk of developing autoimmune thyroid disease and primary hypothyroidism. In patients with growth hormone deficiency, central (secondary) hypothyroidism may first become evident or worsen during somatropin treatment. Therefore, patients treated with somatropin should have periodic thyroid function tests, and thyroid hormone replacement therapy should be initiated or appropriately adjusted when indicated.Patients treated with somatropin who have or are at risk for pituitary hormone deficiency(s) may be at risk for reduced serum cortisol levels and/or unmasking central hypoadrenalism and should be monitored for reduced serum cortisol levels. In addition, patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement for pre-existing hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses following initiation of somatropin treatment and should be monitored for reduced cortisol levels and/or need for glucocorticoid dose increases.Progression of scoliosis can occur in patients who experience rapid growth. Patients with scoliosis should be monitored for manifestation or progression during somatropin therapy.Slipped capital femoral epiphyses may occur more frequently in patients with endocrine disorders (including GHD and Turner syndrome) or in patients undergoing rapid growth. Any pediatric patient with the onset of a limp or complaints of hip or knee pain during somatropin therapy should be carefully evaluated.Somatropin should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed and with caution in nursing mothers because it is not known whether somatropin is excreted in human milk.Subcutaneous injection of somatropin at the same site repeatedly may result in tissue atrophy. This can be avoided by rotating the injection site.Cases of pancreatitis have been reported rarely in children and adults receiving somatropin treatment, with some evidence supporting a greater risk in children compared with adults. Published literature indicates that girls who have Turner syndrome may be at greater risk than other somatropin-treated children. Pancreatitis should be considered in any somatropin-treated patient, especially a child, who develops persistent severe abdominal pain.In clinical trials with GENOTROPIN in pediatric GHD patients, the following events were reported infrequently: injection site reactions, including pain or burning associated with the injection, fibrosis, nodules, rash, inflammation, pigmentation, or bleeding; lipoatrophy; headache; hematuria; hypothyroidism; and mild hyperglycemia.In clinical studies of 273 pediatric patients born SGA treated with GENOTROPIN, the following clinically significant events were reported: mild transient hyperglycemia; 1 patient with benign intracranial hypertension; 2 patients with central precocious puberty; 2 patients with jaw prominence; and several patients with aggravation of preexisting scoliosis, injection site reactions, and self-limited progression of pigmented nevi. Anti-hGH antibodies were not detected in any of the patients treated with GENOTROPIN.Deaths have been reported with the use of a growth hormone in pediatric PWS patients with severe obesity, history of upper airway obstruction or sleep apnea, and/or unidentified respiratory infection. Therefore, all patients with PWS should be evaluated and monitored for signs of upper airway obstruction, sleep apnea, and respiratory infections, and have effective weight control.In clinical trials with GENOTROPIN in pediatric patients with PWS, the following drug-related events were reported: edema, aggressiveness, arthralgia, benign intracranial hypertension, hair loss, headache, and myalgia.Somatropin may increase the occurrence of otitis media in Turner syndrome patients. In 2 clinical studies with GENOTROPIN in pediatric patients with Turner syndrome, the most frequently reported adverse events were respiratory illnesses (influenza, tonsillitis, otitis, sinusitis), joint pain, and urinary tract infection. The only treatment-related adverse event that occurred in more than 1 patient was joint pain.In 2 clinical studies with GENOTROPIN in pediatric patients with ISS, the most commonly encountered adverse events included upper respiratory tract infections, influenza, tonsillitis, nasopharyngitis, gastroenteritis, headaches, increased appetite, pyrexia, fracture, altered mood, and arthralgia.In clinical trials with GENOTROPIN in adults with GHD, the majority of side effects were symptoms of fluid retention, including peripheral swelling/edema, arthralgia, pain and stiffness of the extremities, myalgia, paresthesia, and hypoesthesia. Generally, these were transient and dose-dependent.In women on oral estrogen replacement, a larger dose of somatropin may be required to achieve the defined treatment goal.Elderly patients may be more sensitive to the action of somatropin, and therefore may be more prone to develop adverse reactions.The cartridges of GENOTROPIN contain m-Cresol and should not be used by patients with a known sensitivity to this preservative.Subcutaneous injection of somatropin at the same site repeatedly may result in tissue atrophy. This can be avoided by rotating the injection site.Health care providers should supervise the first injection and provide appropriate training and instruction for the proper use of all devices for GENOTROPIN.Rx onlyFor the full Prescribing Information for GENOTROPIN, please visit http://labeling.pfizer.com/ShowLabeling.aspx?id=577.Pfizer Inc.: Breakthroughs that Change Patients’ LivesAt Pfizer, we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

This move lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 1.15%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.63%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 7.23%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the drugmaker had lost 1.89% over the past month. This has lagged the Medical sector's gain of 2.4% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 3.08% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Pfizer as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be August 1, 2023. On that day, Pfizer is projected to report earnings of $0.63 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 69.12%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $14.01 billion, down 49.51% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $3.35 per share and revenue of $68.1 billion. These totals would mark changes of -49.09% and -32.13%, respectively, from last year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Pfizer should also be noted by investors. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant. Pfizer is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Story continuesValuation is also important, so investors should note that Pfizer has a Forward P/E ratio of 11.02 right now. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 14.76, which means Pfizer is trading at a discount to the group.Investors should also note that PFE has a PEG ratio of 1.22 right now. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. PFE's industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.75 as of yesterday's close.The Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry is part of the Medical sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 90, which puts it in the top 36% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

It also has Rybelsus, its pill for Type 2 diabetes, which the company is also studying for treating obesity.Results from a Phase 3 trial show the pill, at a higher dosage, was effective in reducing weight by 15% for participants.Novo Nordisk's greatest competition remains Eli Lilly (LLY). The two are already fierce competitors in the diabetes care and insulin space, and Eli Lilly has a number of competing products on the market and in the pipeline.Eli Lilly announced Phase 2 data last week for its oral candidate, orforglipron, showing up to 14.7% weight loss. On Monday, it revealed Phase 2 data for its experimental weight loss injection, retatrutide, showing up to 24% weight loss.The Eli Lilly &amp; Co. corporate headquarters are seen in Indianapolis on April 26, 2017. (AP Photo/Darron Cummings, File)The latter is a different subclass of drugs but shows better data than the company's current Type 2 diabetes injectable, Mounjaro. Eli Lilly is also pursuing FDA approval for Mounjaro as a weight loss option for those without diabetes.Pfizer (PFE), meanwhile, is finding its footing in the oral treatment race. Pfizer said it would pursue its twice-daily pill, danuglipron, over its once-daily candidate, lotiglipron, due to concerns of elevated liver damage risk in early-stage trials. The company is moving the drug into Phase 2 to figure out the most effective dosing but said it will also work on trying to make it a once-daily pill in order to compete with Rybelsus and orforglipron. In that regard, Pfizer is a laggard.Meanwhile, insurance coverage remains a hurdle to access. Due to concerns that patients may have to stay on the drugs forever to keep the weight off, insurers are wary of covering them. And though a new study showed half of US adults would be willing to pay $100 per month for a weight loss drug, the cost of Wegovy and Ozempic ranges from more than $800 to more than $1,300 out of pocket.Story continuesFollow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhemClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

In primetime hours, FBN delivered its highest rated quarter since 2020 while CNBC delivered its worst quarter since 2006 with total viewers, since 1992 with the younger 25-54 demo and 2005 with A35-64. Notably, FBN’s market open and close programs, Kudlow and Varney &amp; Co., remained the two highest-rated business news programs.As the markets reacted to news regarding the debt ceiling, the aftereffects of the Silicon Valley Bank collapse and inflation, FBN proved to be the channel viewers turned to as the network continued to best CNBC during key dayparts. Kicking off the pre-market coverage, Maria Bartiromo’s Mornings with Maria (weekdays, 6-9 AM/ET) outpaced CNBC’s signature franchise program Squawk Box, seeing a 2% viewer advantage during the pivotal morning hours this quarter. The trend continued during Stuart Varney’s market-open show Varney &amp; Co. (weekdays, 9 AM-12 PM/ET), which marked five straight quarters beating CNBC’s Squawk on the Street. The second highest-rated show in business, Varney delivered a 31% advantage over CNBC (FBN: 255,000 vs CNBC: 195,000 P2+) this quarter. Rounding out the business day, Neil Cavuto’s CAVUTO: Coast to Coast (weekdays, 12 PM/ET) garnered 154,000 viewers, The Big Money Show (weekdays, 1 PM/ET) banked 130,000 viewers, Making Money with Charles Payne delivered 140,000 viewers and The Claman Countdown (weekdays, 3 PM/ET) scored 152,000 viewers, all ranking among the top 20 business news programs.Post-market coverage delivered strong gains led by Larry Kudlow’s eponymous program, Kudlow (weekdays, 4 PM/ET). Notching six consecutive quarters as the highest-rated program in business news, Kudlow also overtook its competition for the seventh straight quarter by a striking 61% percent with 264,000 viewers compared to CNBC’s 164,000 for Closing Bell. Elizabeth MacDonald’s The Evening Edit (weekdays, 5 PM/ET) amassed 164,000 viewers, outperforming its CNBC competition by 9% and showcasing an 8% year-over-year advantage. Dagen McDowell and Sean Duffy’s newly minted The Bottom Line (weekdays, 6 PM/ET) swept its timeslot with 139,000 viewers, a 12% advantage over CNBC’s 124,000. The program also picked up its second back-to-back quarter win since launch.Story continuesBartiromo’s weekly primetime program Maria Bartiromo’s Wall Street (Fridays, 7-7:30 PM/ET) ushered in 71,000 viewers while Barron’s Roundtable/WSJ at Large with Gerry Baker (Fridays, 7:30-8 PM/ET) posted 2% year-over-year growth. The fourth season of FBN Prime, FOX Business Network’s weekday primetime programming slate, performed especially well with the introduction of the iconic series COPS (Thursdays, 8-11 PM/ET). Measured in the younger demos, COPS was FBN Prime’s first show to beat CNBC for the season, and year-over-year, saw a 33% advantage in viewers, a 200% advantage with A25-54 and a 69% advantage with A35-64. My Dream Car (Tuesdays, 8-11 PM/ET) recorded a 30% year-over-year advantage with total viewers.Additionally, FBN ended the second quarter of the year delivering five of the top 10 cable news programs with affluent audiences amongst the 25-54 demo. Stuart Varney’s American Built (Mondays, 8-11 PM/ET) placed first with viewers’ incomes totaling a median of $212,100. Maria Bartiromo’s Wall Street (Fridays, 7-7:30 PM/ET) placed second with a median income of $169,300. Varney &amp; Co., Mornings with Maria and Making Money with Charles Payne each delivered median incomes greater than $145,500.

Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off.

Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while five have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 79 cents per share to 71 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Fox Corporation right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether International Business Machines' current trading price of US$131 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at International Business Machines’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for International Business Machines What's The Opportunity In International Business Machines?According to my valuation model, International Business Machines seems to be fairly priced at around 8.97% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy International Business Machines today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $120.52, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. What's more, International Business Machines’s share price may be more stable over time (relative to the market), as indicated by its low beta.What does the future of International Business Machines look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for International Business Machines. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in IBM’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on IBM, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing International Business Machines at this point in time.

The transaction is likely to bolster IBM's IT automation capabilities, empowering enterprise leaders to generate incremental value across the technology domain.Apptio is a well-established, profitable leader in technology business management and FinOps, serving in excess of 1,500 clients, including more than half of the Fortune 100. The company has built strong partnerships and integrations with industry giants such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Salesforce, ServiceNow, Oracle and SAP. This aligns with IBM's commitment to fostering an open partner ecosystem.In today's fast-paced digital landscape, organizations are undergoing rapid digital transformations, resulting in the expansion of IT environments across various public and private clouds and multiple service providers. To effectively manage this increased complexity, businesses are turning to Apptio's solutions, which offer integrated and simplified visibility into technology spend across hybrid and multi-cloud environments, labor and associated resources. By combining Apptio's offerings with IBM's IT automation software and Watson AI platform, organizations worldwide will gain the ability to optimize and streamline enterprise IT spend while achieving tangible financial and operational improvements.Apptio's core offerings, delivered as software-as-a-service (SaaS), comprise ApptioOne, Apptio Cloudability and Apptio Targetprocess. ApptioOne provides hybrid cloud spend management and optimization capabilities, enabling organizations to analyze, optimize and plan IT spend. Apptio Cloudability offers visibility and optimization for public cloud spend, connecting multi-cloud and SaaS infrastructure with cloud financial management best practices. Apptio Targetprocess provides agile investment planning capabilities, ensuring alignment of development resources with business outcomes.IBM's acquisition of Apptio will provide clients with a comprehensive technology business management platform, effectively functioning as a ""virtual command center"" for spend management and optimization across their entire technology landscape. Furthermore, Apptio's anonymized IT spend data, amounting to $450 billion, will unlock valuable insights for clients and partners.The acquisition reflects IBM's ongoing commitment to hybrid cloud and AI. It is expected to yield significant synergies in critical growth areas such as automation, Red Hat, IBM's AI portfolio and IBM Consulting. Additionally, Apptio will benefit from IBM's extensive global presence and established partnerships with leading systems integrators.The transaction, expected to close in the latter half of 2023, is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. By joining forces, IBM and Apptio are poised to create a win-win scenario, propelling both companies to newer heights in the rapidly evolving landscape of technology optimization and management.IBM expects its growth to be driven primarily by analytics, cloud computing and security services. A better business mix, improving operating leverage through productivity gains and increased investments in growth opportunities will likely drive its profitability.However, IBM’s current, heavily time-consuming business model transition to the cloud is likely to be a headwind in the near term. Although the public cloud market is expected to be one of the fastest-growing IT categories, with about 25% to 30% CAGR over the next five years, IBM is unlikely to keep up with its competitors. High integration risks from a continuous acquisition spree are potent challenges.In addition, weakness in its traditional business and foreign exchange volatility remain significant concerns. Also, higher profit on lower revenues indicates that the company has been cutting costs to maintain profits. We believe that the scope for further cost-cutting is limited. Consequently, if costs are further reduced, there could be a negative impact on product quality. It could also lead to an additional delay in launching products, denting its long-term growth potential to some extent.The stock has lost 8.1% over the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 6.8%.

198,ee76933a-7329-3608-9182-332b9530ea4b,IBM,2023-06-28,Dubai: Launching a Crypto Regulatory Arm to Become a Global Financial Power,CoinDesk,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dubai-launching-crypto-regulatory-arm-113729132.html,1687865849,STORY,['IBM'],"[Dubai and its sibling hub Abu Dhabi were rated tops in the regulatory structure, the most heavily weighted criterion at 35% of the total score. But the impact was blunted by the UAE’s bottom-quintile crypto adoption score, indicating that the larger population of the UAE is not as crypto-savvy as the residents in these two hubs. Despite the low overall drivers category score, Dubai cemented its place in the top five with high scores in opportunities category, which measured per-capita crypto events, companies and jobs. The emirate also achieved the second-highest quality of life score in our entire sample. Part of the enablers category, quality of life was the second-heaviest weighted criterion, at 15% of the total score.For more on the criteria and how we weighted them, see: How We Ranked CoinDesk’s Crypto Hubs 2023: Our Methodology.(Ian Suarez/CoinDesk)The biggest names in crypto seem to be gravitating to Dubai, the largest city in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Binance co-founders Changpeng “CZ” Zhao and He Yi have made it their home, Coinbase’s Brian Armstong has met with its regulators. And Wazirx, one of India’s largest exchanges, is moving its headquarters there. It seems Dubai’s master plan to enter the top echelon of global financial centers, joining New York, London and Hong Kong, is working.Dubai has been growing as a business and financial services hub for the Middle East over the last few decades by embracing innovation. That’s particularly evident in how it approached crypto with deliberation and intention.Read Crypto Hubs 2023: Where to Live Freely and Work SmartIn 2014 the local government engaged IBM to advise it on new technologies, Saqr Ereiqat, then IBM’s head of public sector consultancy in Dubai, said. He described how conversations kept coming around to blockchain, which eventually led the city-state to officially announce in 2016 that it was discussing a legal framework for cryptocurrencies. Six years later in March 2022, Dubai established the Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA), the world’s first independent crypto regulator.Story continuesAs the crypto industry’s demands for clear regulation in the United States are met with a slew of lawsuits from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the UAE has emerged as a viable alternative. “It's unfortunate, the U.S.’ current position on the [crypto] space,” Bader Al Kalooti, executive director of Binance MENA, told CoinDesk. “But that doesn't mean that the rest of the world isn’t open to crypto. And Dubai and other markets in Asia have opened the doors.”According to the Dubai Statistics Center, as of 2022, over 3.2 million of the Emirate’s total ~3.5 million population is non-Emirati, making it a “melting pot of people” as Al Kalooti explained. With such a diverse population, blockchain technology has numerous use cases in the city, ranging from remittances for those working in Dubai and sending money home or facilitating the flight of capital for those taking refuge from unstable economies.Expansive use casesWhat makes Dubai and the United Arab Emirates unique as a crypto hub is that “it offers a home for all those types of use cases,” Al Kalooti said. Indeed, shortly after establishing VARA, the government unveiled the Dubai Metaverse Strategy and its intention to create “one of the world’s top 10 metaverse economies as well as a global hub for the metaverse community.” The country aims to attract 1,000 blockchain and metaverse companies and create 40,000 virtual jobs by 2030.Situated in proximity to Northern Africa, Asia and Europe, Dubai is not just a travel destination for those seeking a beach vacation, but also fosters global networking and collaboration. The city is the host of GITEX (Gulf Information Technology Exhibition), a leading tech conference featuring blockchain and Web3 as two of its 18 focus areas, that according to local reporting had 170,000 attendees in 2022. There is no shortage of crypto events in Dubai, including Binance Blockchain Week and Dubai Fintech Week.After leaving IBM, Ereiqat co-founded Dubai-based Crypto Oasis, which develops blockchain ecosystems modeled after the Crypto Valley in Zug, Switzerland, the No. 1 spot in CoinDesk’s Crypto Hubs 2023. For those looking to build a team in Dubai, Ereiqat said, “the UAE’s most unique element is the access to talent [...] within three hours you have access to three billion people.”]"

This led to robust first-quarter 2023 results, wherein the bottom and top lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved year over year.The company’s adjusted earnings of 54 cents per share surged 86.2% year over year. Net sales grew 5.9% to $2,346.3 million. On a constant-currency basis, net sales rose 8.2%, driven by favorable price and sales mix, offset by a slight decline in financial volume.Net sales per hectoliter increased 6.1% on a reported basis and 8.4% on a constant-currency basis, driven by strong net pricing and a favorable sales mix stemming from premiumization.Additionally, an uptrend in the Zacks Consensus Estimate echoes the same sentiment. Earnings estimates for GPS’s current financial year have increased 4.6% to $4.54 over the past 30 days.Let’s Delve DeeperMolson Coors is on track with its revitalization plan focused on achieving sustainable top-line growth by streamlining the organization and reinvesting resources into its brands and capabilities. The company intends to invest in iconic brands and growth opportunities in the above-premium beer space; expand in adjacencies and beyond beer; and create digital competencies for commercial functions, supply-chain-related system capabilities and employees.To facilitate these investments, TAP plans to generate savings of $150 million by simplifying its structure. The company is also building on the strength of its iconic core brands. Additionally, its cost-saving program, announced in 2020, targets delivering cost savings of $600 million over three years.Strength in Coors Light, Miller Lite and Coors Banquet resulted in total industry share growth in the United States, driven by brand positionings and better marketing. Molson Canadian and Carling beer in the U.K., and national champion brands witnessed significant market share gains.The company remains committed to growing its market share through innovation and premiumization. With a view to accelerating portfolio premiumization, it has been aggressively growing its above-premium portfolio in the past few years. The company highlighted that it is making efforts to change the shape of its product portfolio and expand in growth areas.Its U.S. above-premium portfolio witnessed sales that outpaced its U.S. economy portfolio, driven by rapid growth of its hard seltzers, the successful launch of Simply Spiked Lemonade, and the continued strength in Blue Moon and Peroni’s.Story continuesDriven by these factors, 2023 sales are projected to grow year over year in the low-single digits on a constant-currency basis, in line with our estimate of 1.5% growth. Underlying EBT is likely to grow year over year in the low-single digits on a constant-currency basis.Consequently, shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have gained 27.8% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 0.1%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research However, Molson Coors’ worldwide first-quarter brand volumes fell 2.1% to 16.2 million due to sluggishness in America, as well as EMEA&amp;APAC. Financial volumes declined 0.2% to 17 million hectoliters due to lower volumes in the Americas, partly offset by increased EMEA&amp;APAC volumes.Cost inflation related to materials, conversion and energy costs, and mix impacts of portfolio premiumization led to a rise in COGS per hectoliter of 22.7% on a reported basis and 7.4% in constant currency. Also, it has been witnessing weakened consumer demand across the beer industry due to pricing actions. Management expects global inflationary pressures to create a headwind.ConclusionWe believe that brand strength, product innovation, pricing actions, the premiumization of its global portfolio, and the revitalization plan will offset cost woes and drive growth further for Molson Coors.

Others are investing in lithium refining or ventures to recycle the silvery-white metal from used batteries.A shortfall in lithium supplies would be an obstacle for plans to ramp up sales to tens of millions of electric vehicles a year. It is fueling political conflict over resources and complaints about the environmental cost of extracting them.“We already have that risk” of not being able to get enough, GM’s chief financial officer, Paul A. Jacobson, said at a Deutsche Bank conference in mid-June.“We’ve got to have partnerships with people that can get us the lithium in the form that we need,” Jacobson said.Ford Motor Co. has signed contracts stretching up to 11 years into the future with lithium suppliers on two continents. Volkswagen AG and Honda Motor Co. are trying to reduce their need for freshly mined ore by forming recycling ventures.Global lithium output is on track to triple this decade, but sales of electric SUVs, sports cars and sedans that rose 55% last year threaten to outrun that. Each battery requires about eight kilograms (17 pounds) of lithium, plus cobalt, nickel and other metals.“There will be a shortage of EV battery supplies,” said Joshua Cobb, senior auto analyst for BMI.Adding to uncertainty, lithium has emerged as another conflict in strained U.S.-Chinese relations.Beijing, Washington and other governments see metal supplies for electric vehicles as a strategic issue and are tightening controls on access. Canada ordered three Chinese companies last year to sell lithium mining assets on security grounds.Story continuesOther governments including Indonesia, Chile and Zimbabwe are trying to maximize their return on deposits of lithium, cobalt and nickel by requiring miners to invest in refining and processing before they can export.GM is buying direct access to lithium by investing $650 million in the Canadian developer of a Nevada mine that is the biggest U.S. source. In return, GM says it will get enough for 1 million vehicles a year.Conservationists and American Indians are asking a federal court to block development of the Nevada mine, which the Biden administration has embraced as part of its clean energy agenda. Opponents say it might poison water supplies and soil and pollute nesting grounds for birds.Despite rising output, the industry may face shortages of lithium and cobalt as early as 2025 if enough isn’t invested in production, according to Leonardo Paoli and Timur Gul of the International Energy Agency.“Supply side bottlenecks are becoming a real challenge,” Paoli and Gul said in a report last year.Automakers might be putting in their own money to reassure “notoriously risk-averse” miners, according to Alastair Bedwell of GlobalData. He said miners are reluctant to “go all out” on lithium until they are sure the industry won’t switch to batteries made with other metals.Even if they do, developing lithium sources is a yearslong process.Worldwide lithium resources are estimated at 80 million tons by the U.S. Geological Survey.Bolivia’s are the biggest at 21 millions tons, followed by Australia with 17 million and Chile with 9 million.Forecasts of annual production range as high as 1.5 million tons by 2030. But demand, if EV sales keep rising at double-digit annual rates, is forecast to increase to up to 3 million tons.EV sales took off in 2021, more than doubling over the previous year to 6.8 million, according to EV Volumes, a research firm. Last year’s sales rose to 10.5 million.China accounted for 60% of last year’s sales, two-thirds of production and three-quarters of battery manufacturing.President Joe Biden last year announced an official goal for half of all new cars sold in the United State to be electric or other zero-emissions technology by 2030.As sales rise, so does official anxiety, especially in Washington and Beijing, about access to lithium and other minerals and the potential for strategic competition.Volkswagen’s battery unit, PowerCo, signed an agreement with Canada last August to develop suppliers of “critical raw materials” including lithium, cobalt and nickel.The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, in a statement welcomed cooperation with “close friends” on “raw material security.”China’s government has accused the United States, Canada, Japan and other governments of misusing phony security concerns to hurt Chinese competitors in electric cars, smartphones, clean energy and other emerging technologies.Other governments welcome Chinese investment. China’s biggest lithium producer, Ganfeng Lithium Co., bought Argentina’s Lithea Inc. last year for $962 million.About two-thirds of the world’s lithium comes from mines. That involves crushing rock and using acids to extract metals. It leaves toxic heaps of chemical-laced tailings.The rest is extracted from salt lakes or salt flats. That can require vast evaporation ponds.The industry is working on technology to extract lithium from hot springs and clay deposits with less environmental impact.As they ramp up supplies, automakers face another bottleneck: Lack of refining capacity to purify raw lithium into battery material.Tesla Inc. is building a refinery in Texas. Others including BMW AG are buying stakes in refiners.As for GM, “I don’t know” whether it will build its own refinery, Jacobson said.]"

GM has entered into an agreement with Element 25 whereby the latter will supply up to 32,500 metric tons of manganese sulfate annually. This will support General Motors’ goal of producing more than 1 million electric vehicles (EVs) in North America.As part of the deal, GM will provide Element 25 with an $85 million loan to partly fund the construction of a new facility in Louisiana. This facility, set to begin production in 2025, will be the first of its kind in the United States. It will process manganese concentrate from Element 25's mining operations in Australia to produce battery-grade manganese sulfate, a crucial component in lithium-ion battery cathodes.General Motors’ agreement with Element 25 demonstrates its commitment to scaling up EV production in North America and investing in battery raw materials, processing and components. This investment not only ensures a reliable supply but also brings numerous benefits, including favorable commercial terms and the creation of thousands of new jobs in the United States, Canada, and countries covered by free trade agreements, such as Australia.Element 25 plans to invest around $290 million to construct a 230,000-square-foot facility, with site preparation scheduled to commence in the third quarter of 2023 and the plant expected to be operational by 2025.GM continues to strengthen its domestic supply base for EV production, not only by securing a steady supply of manganese sulfate but also by directly investing in other key commodities like lithium and nickel, as well as cathode active material (CAM) and CAM precursor.Additionally, GM and its joint venture partners are actively installing 160GWh of battery cell manufacturing capacity in the United States, while suppliers are relocating production of permanent magnets and other EV components to North America. These initiatives have already resulted in the creation of thousands of jobs in various states and provinces, including California, Louisiana, Nevada, Texas, Ohio, Michigan, Tennessee, Ontario and Quebec.Story continuesGeneral Motors currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

However, this encouraging announcement on Jun 22 did not cause any significant movement in the share price of either company.Let’s delve deeper into the news.The collaboration aims to expand the hydrogen locomotive program and demonstrates the long-term viability of hydrogen as a solution for reducing emissions in the rail industry. As a first step, CSX plans to convert one of its diesel locomotives using a hydrogen conversion kit developed by CP, with the work taking place at CSX's locomotive shop in Huntington, WV.This partnership is significant as it brings together two major railroad operators in North America to address the industry's most significant source of greenhouse gas emissions — diesel-powered freight locomotives. By converting these locomotives to run on hydrogen fuel cells and battery technology, the joint venture aims to provide an effective alternative fuel solution that can contribute to a lower carbon economy.The collaboration builds on the progress made by CP in developing North America's first line-haul hydrogen-powered locomotive. CP announced its plans in December 2020 and successfully retrofitted a diesel freight locomotive with hydrogen fuel cells and battery technology. The prototype made its first movement in late 2021 and has since completed over 1,000 miles of testing in revenue service. CP has also deployed a second hydrogen locomotive for testing in terminal operations, with plans for it to enter service later in 2023.The announcement reflects a significant step forward in the development of hydrogen locomotive technology and highlights the commitment of both companies to sustainable transportation solutions. Moreover, the adoption of hydrogen technology in the rail industry could have broader implications. If successful, the joint venture's efforts to reduce emissions from freight locomotives may attract favorable attention from regulators, environmental organizations and stakeholders increasingly focused on decarbonization. This positive perception could create opportunities for CP and CSX to secure government funding, grants, or incentives, further supporting their sustainability initiatives.Story continuesHowever, the deployment of hydrogen locomotives is still in its early stages and there may be challenges and uncertainties along the way. Factors such as infrastructure requirements, scalability and cost-effectiveness will play a crucial role in determining the long-term success and impact of hydrogen locomotives in the rail industry. Investors should closely monitor the joint venture's progress, technological advancements, regulatory developments and market dynamics to assess the potential impact on the stocks of CP and CSX.Zacks Rank &amp; Some Key PicksBoth stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

During first-quarter 2023, occupancy in Las Vegas reached 95%. The upside was primarily driven by strong leisure, group and convention demand. CZR revealed that it began witnessing the pre-COVID return of conventions and groups to Las Vegas.The company is optimistic about booking trends as it is witnessing increased bookings for group and convention room nights. It expects the return of the group and convention business and entertainment offerings to drive incremental demand in the Las Vegas market. In 2023, our model expects revenues from Las Vegas operations to rise 7.7% year over year.CZR is gaining from increased focus on digital efforts. During the first quarter of 2023, it emphasized certain tech enhancements to boost product offering and drive better customer engagement.

LYV is likely to benefit from pent-up demand for live events, Venue Nation portfolio and the sponsorship and advertising business. Also, focus on new client additions bode well. However, rise in operating expenses are a concern.Let us discuss the factors that highlight why investors should retain the stock for the time being.Growth CatalystsShares of Live Nation have gained 28.6% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 13% growth. The company is benefiting from pent-up demand for live events and robust ticket sales. During the first quarter of 2023, the company sold $72.6 million in fee-bearing tickets, up 41% year over year. the upside was primarily backed by solid North America concert ticket sales growth (35%) and international concert ticket sales growth (65%). Also, it recorded benefits from new client additions. Backed by solid consumer demand and increased ticket volume, gross transaction value (GTV) during the quarter came in at $7.7 billion, up 60% year over year. Going forward, the company anticipates increased Live Nation concert ticket sales and additional sales from ancillary revenue streams, including insurance, upgrades and other upsells.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIncreased focus on Venue Nation portfolio bodes well. In 2023, the company emphasized on hosting nearly 3 million fans at 1,000 shows. It is optimistic in this regard and anticipates the initiative to drive long-term growth and profitability across its businesses.The company is affirmative about its growth prospects in 2023. Robust fan engagement will likely continue into 2023, as arenas, amphitheaters and stadiums are expected to witness growth in their show count and ticket sales relative to 2022 levels. For concerts, the company stated that it has already sold more than 90 million tickets (as of May 2023), up 20% year over year. In terms of tickets, the company is likely to benefit from the market pricing trend.The company emphasizes sponsorship and advertising businesses to drive growth. In first-quarter 2023, total revenues from Sponsorship &amp; Advertising business came in at $170.1 million, up 47% from $115.7 million reported in the previous year. The upside was primarily driven by the reopening of international markets, the increase in high-profile artists (that attract premium marketing partners) and the expansion of our venue network. Also, it stated benefit from new partnerships, including Google Pixel, PayPal and Levi's. Given the strength in consumer demand (for the upcoming shows) and confirmed sponsorship activity (of more than 80%), the momentum will likely persist in the upcoming periods.Story continuesConcernsThe company has been bearing the brunt of increased expenses for some time. The downside is compounded by noticeably high costs (caused by expanded operations) and higher selling, general and administrative expenditures (due to compensation costs brought on by increasing staff year over year). In first-quarter 2023, total direct operating expenses were $2,115.6 million compared with $1,071 million reported in the prior-year quarter. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the same quarter were $690.3 million compared with $570.2 million reported in the prior-year period. The company is cautious of cost overruns related to the development and expansion of live music venues.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksLive Nation currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector are as follows:Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.

In fact, an increasing number of Americans are traveling and more people are planning to go on vacations through 2023.This comes despite higher air ticket prices and hotel tariffs as people are ready to shell out more. Traveling, which had almost come to a standstill in 2020 due to the pandemic, rebounded strongly in 2022, and this year, too, people want to travel at least as much as last year.More Americans TravelingAccording to a Forbes Advisor survey, 87% of the respondents plan to travel as much as they did in 2022, while 49% plan to travel more. Understandably, young people are more inclined toward traveling.Among those who plan to travel more, 59% are between 18 and 26. Among them, 45% traveled at least once or twice in 2022, while 22% traveled on three or more occasions.This means a large number of people plan to travel more than three to four times this year. Also, all types of trips are popular this year. The survey also shows that more than 50% of those traveling plan to go on vacations or pleasure trips, which include road trips, beach vacations and trips.High prices have been posing a major challenge for the travel industry but people are willing to spend more knowing that costs are a lot higher than in 2022. Among those who plan to travel this year, 45% have a higher budget, while 28% have the same budget. Most people plan to spend $4,000 or more on traveling and vacationing this year, while 28% plan to have a budget between $2,000 and $3,999.Hotels, airlines and other leisure companies had a solid holiday season in 2022 as millions of Americans went on vacations after staying almost indoors for two years owing to the pandemic. The trend seems to be continuing this year too.Inflation, too, has been showing signs of easing and the Fed has finally paused its interest rate hikes. Lower borrowing rates thus bode well for both the vacationers and the travel industry. Given this situation, it would be ideal to invest in hotels, leisure, and airline stocks, which tend to benefit from the travel boom.Story continuesOur ChoicesGiven this situation, it would be wise to invest in these four stocks.

We believe Jeff has been an astute allocator of capital and has created tremendous shareholder value over the long term. Jeff will be retiring from SBA at the end of 2023.We believe a series of issues are likely to temper SBA’s growth in the next few years, including higher debt refinancing costs, wireless carrier decommissioning, headwinds from the company’s Latin American operations, and perhaps foreign exchange headwinds. Our sense is that the company’s annual cash flow growth will decelerate from 14% in 2022 to just 3% in 2023 and remain at modest annual growth rates over the next few years. The company’s high leverage, approximately 6.9 times net debt to cash flow, will limit the company’s ability for share repurchases and external growth opportunities.”Story continuesSBA Communications Corporation (NASDAQ:SBAC) is not on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

230,f766f3e0-4169-3251-b455-20bc847d9098,RF,2023-06-28,7 Stocks to Sell Immediately Before the Bubble Bursts,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-sell-immediately-bubble-012744480.html,1687397264,STORY,"['UBS', 'RF', 'SOFI', 'VNO', 'NVDA']","[Deciding on which stocks to sell before a bubble burst depends on first defining where bubbles exist. That’s difficult to predict as the U.S. economy continues to confound even the best economic minds. That’s not to say there aren’t high-risk bubble stocks to sell. There are. In fact, despite positive signs, bubbles continue to exist everywhere. Macroeconomic factors suggest the U.S. economy is not healthy overall. U.S. debt remains sky-high at the government level. The deficit is growing and recent theatrics in Congress haven’t changed anything for the better. In addition, bubbles extend to credit card debt, car loan debt, student loan debt, the housing market, the commercial real estate market, and tech stocks that have propped up a surging stock market. A severe recession remains entirely possible. Whether that occurs or not it makes sense to drop riskier stocks currently. High-Risk Bubble Stocks: Wells Fargo (WFC)Figurines of two little men in suits looking at downward stock arrow going through the floorSource: shutterstock.com/Black SalmonInvestors should seriously consider dropping Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). Trust in banks has taken a hit in 2023. Among big banks, only JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) has been spared in 2023. That’s largely due to its size and the leading role it played when regional banks collapsed months earlier. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe point here is that Wells Fargo was already suffering a lack of trust prior to the most recent meltdown. The company already got caught for creating fake accounts in order to make its operations appear stronger than they were. It’s a wild and concerning thing to do for any bank, especially one of the largest in the U.S. The bank was trying to put that scandal behind it. It clearly did a poor job as it recently was fined $1 billion for overstating its progress in cleaning up that scandal. I believe it’s fair to state that Wells Fargo is not a trustworthy bank at this point. Given that you shouldn’t inherently trust banks overall, that’s probably saying something. Again, consider Wells Fargo a high-risk bubble stock to sell now.Story continuesHigh-Risk Bubble Stocks: Regions Financial (RF)Grayish photo of investor's hands hovering over laptop with red stock graph showing downward arrow overlayed on top of the imageSource: shutterstock.com/Leonid SorokinRegions Financial (NYSE:RF) is a regional bank and stock that offers a catch-22 in terms of investing. It’s also another high-risk bubble stock to sell. The company appears to be doing well based on its first-quarter results. Earnings are up, revenues increased by 22%, and it seems to be heading toward a better place. That’s the magic of increased interest rates that increase net interest income. Regions Financial serves the southeast, deep south, and midwest. But it is most concentrated across Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and Florida. Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia all happen to be among the states that struggle the most with credit card debt. So, with credit card debt above $1 trillion and a clear bubble at hand, Regions Financial is at risk. Commercial real estate and mortgage loans make up roughly one-third of its outstanding loans. Those are bubbles of their own. The overall picture for RF stock is a high-risk bank exposed to serious bubbles that continue to brew.  High-Risk Bubble Stocks: SoFi Technologies (SOFI)little girl holding a stock chart with athumbs down. stocks to avoidSource: ShutterstockThe clearest reason to sell SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI) stock today is simply that it has gotten too hot, too quickly. The stock was one of the big winners to emerge from the debt ceiling deal. That deal set a clear date for the resumption of federal student loan payments. SoFi Technologies, which holds significant student loans, is a clear beneficiary of the deal then. Share prices basically doubled due to the discussions and deal. So, investors should sell it in order to simply capture their profit. But that’s not really why I’m bearish on SOFI stock. Instead, I believe that SoFi Technologies now suffers from the real risk that the restart of repayments won’t be as strong as analysts believe. There’s a very real risk that strained student loan holders will default in record numbers in the coming months. They were already defaulting at record rates prior to the pause. They have less money now than they did then so it only makes sense that things are going t get worse. Vornado Realty Trust (VNO)a frustrated man with a white board behind him that features a black downward arrowSource: ShutterstockI’ve written about Vornado Realty Trust (NYSE:VNO) as a stock to avoid several times recently. I continue to believe it should be avoided today. The commercial real estate firm is heavily concentrated across office spaces in New York, Chicago, and San Francisco. It should be high on any list of commercial real estate bubble stocks. Vornado Realty Trust has postponed dividend payments until the end of 2023. REIT stocks use high-yield dividends to lure investors. When they pay things are great. It was paying a very high 11%. That income now no longer exists. In the first quarter, Vornado’s net income was five-fold. San Francisco has recently been in the headlines as hotels close after failing to make payments. Cracks are emerging in the commercial real estate sector. Vornado’s markets also suffer from being in geographies in which workers have much more sway. Return-to-office mandates aren’t going to go over well in San Francisco, New York, and Chicago. It all spells continued trouble and bigger losses. Nvidia (NVDA)earningsSource: ShutterstockIf there is a single tech stock at the most risk, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has to be it. The emergence of AI has catalyzed a recent surge across the tech industry. That surge has been powerful enough to raise markets overall, accounting for a great percentage of overall market gains of late. Nvidia’s chips have emerged to be a keystone to the generative AI progress that promises to rapidly increase productivity and revenues along with it. The firm’s huge Q1 earnings release and second-quarter guidance took it from a potential AI champion to the clear winner. Concerns of an AI bubble cropped up as soon as earnings were released. They died down and NVDA shares jumped higher again. I’m not saying investors should dump Nvidia now. I have no way to accurately say it’s going to cool off. Honestly, I thought it would stay at $390 but I was wrong. It’s now at $430. Yet, more and more bears are emerging drawing comparisons between AI and the Dot com bubble. It’s almost moot to say take profits now. I’m sure most readers will have done that if they’ve been lucky enough to buy it months ago. Yet, it’s fair to warn that buying in now is clearly risky. Armour Residential REIT (ARR)a keyboard with a greet enter key marked sell, representing overvalued stocks to sellSource: ShutterstockArmour Residential REIT’s (NYSE:ARR) price chart tells investors a great deal about the stock. Inflation concerns that cropped up in late 2021 and culminated in rate hikes beginning in March of 2022 correlate nicely with its arc. Share prices have more than halved since then. Funnily enough, the company was arguably doing worse prior to Fed rate hikes. Its net loss in the first quarter of 2022 totaled $66.43 million. It narrowed to $34.35 million in the first quarter of this year. That was mostly on account of securities trading discrepancies during those two respective periods. Net interest income dropped by a factor of three. That means interest rate increases are hurting the firm.  What’s particularly troublesome is that the company almost brags about raising $181 million in capital by issuing 30 million new shares in the first quarter. There are only 190 million in total. That should be dilutive. The dividend yielding 18.4% is a siren song that investors should avoid. Vornado Realty Trust, just above, should tell investors all they need to know in that regard. UBS Group (UBS)sell written on a chalkboard representing overvalued stocks to sellSource: ShutterstockUBS Group (NYSE:UBS) emerged as a winner as U.S. regional bank meltdown contagion spread to Europe and claimed Credit Suisse. UBS was forced to save Credit Suisse by regulators. It initially bristled at the prospect of doing so but the result is that there is no one single European money manager for the global elite. The forced merger will result in tens of thousands of jobs lost as UBS sheds Credit Suisse employees in the aftermath. As sympathetic as I am to them, that’s no reason to suggest it’s time to sell UBS. Frankly, it should benefit share prices due to the implied increase in efficiency. The reason is that it isn’t a well-run bank despite its association with the global elite and a previously untouchable Swiss banking sector. Multiple financial metrics indicate real distress. In particular, UBS’ equity-to-asset ratio is very weak. The lower the ratio, the more likely a bank is to be reliant on debt financing. UBS’ ratio is worse than 9 out of 10 banks. Further, it simply doesn’t create value as revealed by a return on investment of 0%.  On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Foreign tourists can then pay with WeChat when traveling in mainland China.This comes after Mastercard announced last week that cardholders can link credit or debit cards to the Alipay digital wallet where they can finally “pay like a local”. Alipay is the mobile payment app owned by Ant.China’s mobile payment network became highly closed-off to overseas tourists since mobile apps became the predominant payment method in the country in the late 2010s, triggering a boom in ecommerce. Foreign visitors often find themselves unable to pay for things in China where many shops and restaurants now only accept mobile payment rather than credit cards or cash.Prior to the easy card linkage change, foreigners in China typically needed to set up a Chinese bank account to access Tencent’s and Ant’s mobile payment networks.Tencent and Ant had formed partnerships with Visa and Mastercard in 2019 to make foreign cards usable on their platforms. But as China closed its borders during the COVID-19 pandemic and international arrivals to the country plummeted, such initiatives had taken a back seat, two people familiar with the matter said.However, the plans have regained momentum as China began reopening this year. Under the new setup, international travelers can set up their foreign cards on these apps with a few simple steps.To be sure, Tencent’s and Ant’s partnerships with Visa and Mastercard in 2019 already allowed some overseas users to use their credit cards in China but at the time only select businesses were allowed to process international credit cards. Now, Tencent and Ant are opening up their entire ecosystems to foreign cards, allowing visitors to pay for a host of goods and services ranging from a quick meal at a food truck to life insurance.Story continues“Our efforts to further open payment services to visitors coincide with the full resumption of travel and tourism to China, as well as major upcoming international events in the country scheduled this year,” Tencent said in a statement on Wednesday.Overseas tourists including those from Hong Kong and Macau spent US$131 billion in mainland China in 2019, before the onset of the pandemic.Visa and Mastercard have not replied to Reuters’ requests for comments.While China’s mobile payment networks have been closed off to foreign-issued credit cards, domestically issued credit cards under Visa and Mastercard have long been supported.(Reporting by Josh Ye; Editing by Kim Coghill)]"

Some investors want quick trades, while others may buy a stock for regular dividend payments.However, one of the most fruitful methods for compounding capital over the long run is to buy and hold compounder stocks, even better if you can purchase them at a discount.What is a Compounder Stock?A compounder stock is a company with high return on invested capital, a robust franchise, recurring revenues, intangible assets, pricing power, and low capital intensity. These are companies that have exhibited exceptional long-term returns, and regularly outperform during economic downturns. They remain resilient during tough economic times because their products are necessities, with wide margins, and very regular purchases or usage.Visa , Automatic Data Processing and Alphabet all have the qualities of a compounder stock, and currently enjoy high Zacks Ranks, further improving near-term expectations. Additionally, they are all trading below their respective long-term average valuations, making them very appealing investment options.VisaVisa is a quintessential compounder stock. Visa boasts gross margins of 99%, net margins of 50%, and functions essentially as a tax on debit and credit card purchases. Using Visa products is a non-discretionary decision, and Visa cards are sometimes used multiple times per day, whether it’s a recession or boom time.This near monopoly status on consumer payment processing has led to very strong and steady returns for V stock. Over the last 15 years Visa has compounded at an annual rate of 18%, leading to an 11x return over that period.Visa also has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Analysts have almost unanimously upgraded their earnings estimates for Visa across timeframes. Current quarter earnings are projected to grow 6% YoY and FY23 earnings are expected to climb 14.5% YoY.Story continuesVisa is currently trading at a compelling discount to its historic valuation. At 26.4x one-year forward earnings it is above the market average of 20.2x, but below its 10-year median of 28x. While this isn’t a huge discount, it is rare that quality companies like this trade far below their average.AlphabetAlphabet is of course the parent company to Google, the world's principal search engine, online advertising platform, and leading technology company. GOOGL as well fits pristinely into the compounder stock category, with wide margins, strong brand, and is minimally affected by economic cycles.Over the last 20 years Alphabet has compounded at an impressive 22.2% annually, returning a total of 4,500% over that time.GOOGL has enjoyed some slight revisions higher in its earnings estimates over the last 90 days earning it a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). FY23 earnings estimates have increased by 5% over the last three months and are forecast to grow 18.6% YoY. Earnings are expected to grow by 14.5% annually over the next 3-5 years for the technology giant.Alphabet is currently trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 21.9x, which is just above the market average of 20.2x, and below its 10-year median of 26.5x. At the beginning of 2023 GOOGL’s forward earnings multiple traded down to its 10-year low, and even now it is still at a compelling valuation.Automatic Data ProcessingFounded in 1949, Automatic Data Processing is one of the leading providers of cloud-based human resources solutions.

Additionally, the stock yields a 2.3% dividend yield, which has increased by 11.1% annually over the last five years. Showing its commitment to returning cash to shareholders, ADP management has also diligently bought back shares in the company, reducing the share count by 15% over the last ten years.Advanced Data Processing is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 26.4x, which is above the market average of 20.2x, and below its 10-year median of 28x. You can see all these stocks consistently trade above the market average, and for good reason. Because they are such stellar companies, their earnings are expected to grow faster than the market average, earning them premium valuations.Bottom LineWhile none of these stocks offer bargain valuations, they are companies with some of the most consistently growing earnings in the market. Because of that, they rarely trade at significant discounts. However, today they are below historical averages, making them appealing to investors with a longer time frame and penchant for these types of stocks.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

The collaboration, led out of Asia Pacific, marks the first time Visa, the world's leading company in digital payments, and SAP, one of the world's market leaders in enterprise application software, join forces to bring to life an innovation to embed payments into the SAP ecosystem through SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP).(PRNewsfoto/Visa)Around 99 per cent of the world's largest companies are SAP customers.[1] This collaboration sets the stage for Visa and SAP to explore embedded finance in the B2B market, helping integrate a financial journey into business operations. Visa estimates that opportunities to digitise B2B payment flows today represent more than $50 trillion across Asia Pacific.[2]For Visa, the move is in line with its strategy to increase its footprint in the B2B space, supporting broader money movement flows between individuals, businesses and governments, beyond consumer payments. This includes accounts receivable and payable flows, corporate payments with card-based solutions and cross-border payments.""The movement of money is becoming increasingly digital, but the bulk of transformation has been focused on the consumer space,"" Stephen Karpin, Regional President of Asia Pacific, Visa, said.  ""There is an urgent need to modernise the way enterprises pay and enhance the B2B payment experience. Our collaboration with SAP is an exciting step in making B2B payments simpler and more intuitive as organisations can make payments immediately on SAP platforms with their Visa corporate cards, instead of having to leave their existing enterprise ecosystem and to navigate the different payment methods that their vendors accept. B2B payments needs to be intuitive, speedy and fuss-free, so organisations can spend time and resources on other aspects of their businesses.""Story continuesFor SAP, this move is meant to enhance its customers' experience in using SAP's software to run their businesses. Running on SAP BTP, the B2B payment services will offer convenient Visa payment services to SAP customers. Injecting more automation into payments – which marks the last mile of procurement – will help enterprises drive further efficiency in their purchasing journey as they make payments securely within a few clicks.""Our collaboration with Visa endeavours to streamline and simplify the B2B payment process and drive further efficiencies for our joint customers. Embedding Visa payment into the SAP ecosystem aims to scale and accelerate digital commerce; together empowering enterprises, from small businesses to government agencies and non-profit organisations, to make secure payments with just a few clicks, transforming the last mile of procurement,"" said Paul Marriott, President of SAP Asia Pacific Japan.The embedded finance solution will be offered initially to SAP customers in Australia, India, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam, with plans to roll out across other markets in the region.Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) is an innovation platform optimised for SAP applications in the cloud that brings together application development and automation, data and analytics, integration, and artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities into one unified environment. Through this new collaboration, Visa and SAP will help bridge working capital gaps in the supply chain. Under its suite of Commercial &amp; Money Movement Solutions, Visa will deliver capabilities through SAP BTP to route commercial payments to all suppliers, whether they accept card payments or not. This solution will help businesses who are Visa cardholders make payments seamlessly and utilise their cardholder benefits, be it domestically or cross-border.  The collaboration will also help to further digitise and speed up B2B payments across Asia Pacific's supply chains. Many businesses in Asia Pacific, especially smaller ones that tend to lack the resources to digitalise B2B payment acceptance, do not yet accept commercial card payments. It can be challenging for card-enabled businesses to pay digitally as they resort to traditional, manual and time-consuming payment methods such as cash and cheques. It also affects the cash flow for both payers and suppliers as transactions via traditional payment methods tend to take a longer time to process and complete.SAP and SAP products and services mentioned herein as well as their respective logos are trademarks or registered trademarks of SAP SE in Germany and other countries.Please see https://www.sap.com/copyright for additional trademark information and notices. All other product and service names mentioned are the trademarks of their respective companies.About VisaVisa (NYSE: V) is a world leader in digital payments, facilitating payments transactions between consumers, merchants, financial institutions and government entities across more than 200 countries and territories.

236,99655662-a2ed-3571-871b-8aa8527bccea,V,2023-06-28,Why Nvidia's price volatility has one strategist trimming his holdings,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/why-nvidias-price-volatility-one-195439895.html,1687895679,VIDEO,"['PGR', 'NVDA', 'V', 'GOOG', 'GOOGL']","[Financial and tech stocks are climbing on boosted valuations, but whose growth is here to stay? Aptus Capital Advisors Portfolio Manager David Wagner breaks down his top stock picks, including his outlook on tech giants Alphabet and Nvidia after AI trends injected volatility into the space.Video Transcript[MUSIC PLAYING]- Investors piling back into tech stocks today, coming on the heels of yesterday's move to the downside, while our next guest is warning not to be fooled by some of these recent moves, they certainly have been the outperformers so far this year. He's actually pointing to some other areas to focus on for future investments, joining us now, we want to bring in David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors. David, it's great to see you here, so you're coming with some picks that you see an opportunity with for the second half of the year. When it comes to some of the moves that we've seen in tech, you actually like two names outside of tech, let's start with Visa, your first pick, why do you like it? Why are they positioned well?DAVID WAGNER: Yeah, I definitely think it's time more for the average stock to succeed and more some of what they're calling the Magnificent Seven, maybe, just to take a little bit of break. But simply put, Seana, you know, I believe that the combination of double-digit revenue growth with mid-team EPS growth and the stock trading at a historical discount on its multiple, well, that's going to check a lot of boxes for me here in this market, all though I do think that investors have been a little bit confused around Visa's recent stock performance, I think that really stems from the expectations that volumes are going to decline into the future. I mean, if you look at the Bank of America data coming out in May and April, it did point to some weakness on consumer spending, well, at least, decelerated right now, so, yeah, dollar volumes are definitely making people think that, you know, Visa may not be a really exciting place to be right now. I mean, yes, it's already an overcrowded name, but I think that a lot of these problems are definitely getting discounted in the valuation right now, the stock trades at only-- only a 30% premium to the S&amp;P 500 when it tends to trade at a 50% premium right now. So in all told, I do think that the company's ability to protect on the bottom line in a variety of macro-scenarios, alongside a reasonable valuation, is definitely a reason to remain invested in this name or add to a position.Story continues- Let's talk about the names you're trying to avoid because there's lots of parts through. These have been real favorites here, at least in the first half of the year. Two stocks you say you want to avoid are big tech, Google, let's start with that one because they've recently received two downgrades, the latest one coming from Bernstein, it's interesting to see these notes coming out, talking about the concerns about AI on their search ad business, not necessarily their ability to compete on the technology of AI, how do you view that?DAVID WAGNER: Yeah, it's probably more of a tepid check here for me because I'm probably going to sound a little bullish on Google here right now because it's a wonderful stock to really own for the long-term, if I had some type of portfolio where it was more of a set it and forget it, you know, over the next three to five years, I would happily own Google in it. But I do think, in the near-term, that there's going to be some short-term headwinds here, especially after the recent price movement, I mean, most of all, I do think the stock looks fairly value-- fairly valued as the narrative here has definitely caught up with the fundamentals. But yeah, that's definitely has allowed this company to, you know, be up 40% since its market bottomed back in November, but it does appear, as you just mentioned, that, you know, Google Search market position is definitely under increasing threat from Microsoft.And then you have a potential, you know, for some type of financial problems from integrating Baird into Google Search, basically, you know, the company's risking us creating some near-term air pockets on the revenue side by cannibalizing some, you know, prime real estate for their generative AI results, which is definitely going to take away ad space from its buyers. But you know, I think it's kind of, probably, dangerous, you know, there is some danger-- I guess, it's probably the better way of saying it-- in moving to the sidelines on a name like Google because it screens really well, I mean, the company has a ton of cash, it's trading, you know, like, 20 times forward expectations, and the company still could see, definitely, a pathway to a 12% revenue growth, KGA, actually, over the next few years. But really, from my seat, I think that the risk associated with this competition in search and then some potential margin misses definitely outweighs the potential upside, actually, from just some topline beats here.- David, another name that you're seeming to avoid, Nvidia, that's, like, up 185% since the start of the year, why is this as good as it gets? At least for now?DAVID WAGNER: Yeah, I-- I probably trimmed this a little too early, but I'm actually still in this name, I love the name, you know, long-term, but I'm probably going to continue to collect some gains here. And I'm not going to-- I'm going to mention, it's not solely because of that massive move you just mentioned there, Seana, but really, more, it's just the injection in a portfolio from a price-volatility standpoint, you know, given that the stock is probably very highly valued in the eyes of many people. I mean, we all know that this is really just more of a narrative type of stock right now, and in the AI space, there's going to be winners, and there's going to be losers because, you know, it's a potentially very, very large market, so we know that there's probably going to be wild prices in valuations, some wild pricing just at the individual stock level.And that's probably what you're going to get here in the video, especially, as I mentioned, with its valuation, but I think it's also important for investors, really, to understand the bull case here, and that's definitely around [INAUDIBLE] because I do think that GPU will continue to drive positive earnings revisions into the future because, what we've learned from past cycles is that, data center cycles, they don't just last one year, so that last earnings report on their Q2 guidance, probably, isn't one-time in nature. But the biggest reason, as I mentioned before there, Seana, that I'm on the sidelines is that, there's probably going to be some air pockets in this price because that's a risk of buying a name at this valuation of what they're trading at right now. If there is an air pocket on some type of earnings guidance, which is probably inevitable at some type of point, you know, you could see the stock going back 20%, but like I mentioned before, I-- I own the name, I've trimmed the name, but that's really because I don't want to subject a lot of my investors to all that price volatility within a portfolio.- David, is that something that's specific to Nvidia, though, because we've seen a lot of choppiness in Nvidia's competitors as well, especially given the enthusiasm around AI? Is it specifically the concern around these air pockets that you talked about with NVIDIA? Or can you sort of put that thesis to some other names like an AMD and other chip makers?DAVID WAGNER: Yeah, I think that's a comment that-- a blanket comment that can be tossed across a multitude of names, look at Marvell, look at AMD, you know, look at AVGO. And if I were to play one there, [INAUDIBLE] I probably would be playing more Broadcom right now, which-- which I do own, more so because of the valuation, it's trading closer to 17, 18 times while, you know, Nvidia is trading, actually, at a lower than historical multiple of about 46 times, it's still below, like, an AMD and a Marvel. So I believe that-- you know what, people here, over the last 10 years, have believed that price presages price movements, when in fact, over longer periods of time, price doesn't always presage price movements, it's valuation is one of the best drivers to presage future outperformance.- All right, David, before we let you go, let's get to your last pick that you actually like right now, you think it's positioned well in the insurance family progressive, what is the edge that you see in Progressive against some of its competitors?DAVID WAGNER: Yeah, Seana, I really, really like Progressive right now, probably a little too much, to be quite honest, but I believe that their positioning and profitability of Progressive really makes it a category killer, I mean, the company benefits from size, it benefits from scale, I mean, just look at the long-standing track record of its superior underwriting prowess, and then, you also have a company that's experienced its fastest growth in about 21 years, which is aided by its dominant brand name and, you know, its multiple distribution channels. I think that the misunderstood part here-- why it's only trading at 17 times-- is that, auto insurance pricing works on a two-year lag, you know, go back two, three years, you had a substantial increase in used car pricings since COVID, but you had these higher loss ratios because these companies weren't compensated from an increase of premiums just yet because they had that two-year lag. But now, we're starting to see, actually, the exact opposite, you're starting to see used car pricing come down and appear to where actually auto insurers are getting some type of tailwinds from rate increases, just look what's going on in California, in that case, but you know, that's really increasing the revenue, and that's increasing profitability, with a healthier combined ratio. I think the knock on PGR is probably the exact knock you're going to give on NVIDIA, it's going to be valuation, but I think, here, in this case, investors are miscategorizing the name because, yes, it's an insurer, it's a financial, but I don't see it as a financial at all, I actually see it as more of a consumer staple, in my opinion. And if you look at it versus consumer staple peers, whether you're going to throw out a Colgate, a P&amp;G, a Pepsi, it actually trades closer to the lower end of its range-- of its two-year range, actually, by 2 standard deviations, so I would actually say this is more of a relative value here, especially if you're looking to become more defensive in your portfolio positioning without giving up some type of earnings power.- And it certainly hasn't seen much move since the start of the year, up just over 1%, we'll see if the second half is better than the first. All right, David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors, thanks so much.]"

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis of the key to franchise growth and see the top 5 franchises, head straight to the 5 Biggest Franchises In The World.The world has witnessed the remarkable rise of franchises, a business model that has thrived for decades and propelled numerous brands to unprecedented heights. With their tried-and-true formula, these franchises have cemented their status as global behemoths, capturing the hearts and wallets of consumers worldwide. From renowned fast-food empires to iconic retail giants, the most prominent franchises like Starbucks, McDonald's, and The UPS Store, among others, have become synonymous with success, leveraging their devoted customer base, a distinct brand identity, and a proven blueprint for expansion. These powerhouses stand as a testament to the enduring allure and profitability of the franchise model, exerting their influence and dominating industries on a global scale. Replication and Expansion: The Key to Franchise Growth When it comes to growing a franchise, replication, and expansion are the keys to success. By replicating successful models and expanding into new markets, company owners can increase their reach and profitability. Replication not only ensures consistency but also maximizes profitability. Standardized procedures and practices streamline operations, which leads to reduced costs and increased income. According to recent financial statistics, franchises that use replication strategies have seen a 34% profit increase. Expansion, on the other hand, opens up new growth opportunities. Franchises can explore new markets and product lines to stay ahead of the curve and adapt to changing consumer needs. By expanding into international markets, franchises can tap into the growing global economy and increase their revenue streams. Recent financial data shows that franchises that have expanded their reach have seen a 45% increase in profits. Story continuesInternational Influence: Franchises Making a Global Impact In today's global economy, franchises are a lucrative business model. McDonald's, for example, reported a revenue of $23.18 billion in 2022, a testament to its success on a global scale. Similarly, Starbucks reported a net income of $3.28 billion in 2022, indicating its popularity among coffee lovers worldwide. These figures demonstrate the financial rewards of tapping into the global market. With the potential to expand their customer base and increase revenue growth, theses top franchises in the world are set to continue significantly impacting the worldwide economy. According to the International Franchise Association (IFA), the franchise industry has been experiencing consistent growth in recent years. In 2021, the total economic output of the franchise sector was estimated to be $787.5 billion in the United States alone. The franchise industry also employed over 8.3 million people, significantly contributing to job creation. When it comes to profitability, franchising can offer attractive financial opportunities for franchisees and franchisors. Franchise profitability is predominantly influenced by average sales, typically falling between $400,000 and $1.4 million annually for traditional brick and mortar franchises, as stated by the American Franchise Academy.However, financial performance can differ based on factors such as industry, location, and the specific franchise system. Each franchise's profitability may vary, so it's crucial to consider these individual factors when assessing potential returns on investment.Navigating the Financial Landscape of Franchise Investments Franchises, often counted among the largest and most profitable businesses in the world, offer enticing prospects for financial success. Opening a franchise entails a significant financial commitment, including franchise fees and setup expenses that vary depending on the franchise. Initial investments can range from modest amounts, such as $24,000 for Century 21 Real Estate, to substantial sums like the $118 million required for a Marriott Hotel franchise.Beyond the initial investment, franchisees bear ongoing financial responsibilities, including annual licensing fees and royalties paid throughout their business venture. These financial commitments are integral to the franchise model, ensuring the necessary support from the franchisor while offering the potential for considerable returns to driven entrepreneurs.  With that out of the way, we move on to the list of the biggest franchises in the world.

241,5e8a5a3c-9bc6-3149-87f3-dc85432127ef,MAR,2023-06-28,25 Most Unfriendly Countries in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/25-most-unfriendly-countries-world-173251182.html,1687887171,STORY,"['DAL', 'MAR']","[In this article, we’ll take a look at the 25 Most Unfriendly Countries in the World. For a quick overview of the top ten, head over to the 10 Most Unfriendly Countries in the World.The world can be a wonderful place, full of opportunities for discovering unique cultures, fascinating histories, and charming landscapes. However, our experiences across different countries can swing from warm, friendly encounters to feeling somewhat unwelcome.This doesn’t mean a country inherently harbors unfriendly citizens. The concept of friendliness is subjective, which can be a blend of cultural misunderstandings, historical context, and personal bias.For instance, certain traditions or communication styles may appear unfriendly to outsiders, but they might be social norms for locals. In Nordic countries like Finland and Demark, people value personal space and privacy, but tourists may see it as unfriendly behavior.The Happiest Countries in the World report confirms this cultural conflict, showing that Nordic countries top the charts in terms of citizen happiness. But they may not always rank high on the expat’s friendliness scale. When it comes to the most visited countries in the world, France, Spain, Mexico, and Türkiye seem to top the results.Friendless and Tourism IndustryTourism is considered the backbone of many economies around the globe. The direct contributions to a nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) through visitor expenditures on accommodation, food and drink services, entertainment, shopping, and transportation can be extensive.In 2022, the travel and tourism sector contributed 7.6% to the global GDP and supported about 22 million new jobs. This highlights the massive potential of tourism as a driver of economic growth and job creation.For example, the Caribbean region’s tourism industry contributed approximately 13.7% to its GDP and created around 17.1 million jobs in 2023. Likewise, the tourism industry in Thailand contributed 19.7% to its GDP in 2019. This is attributed to Thailand's vibrant culture, exotic beaches, and renowned hospitality, which attract millions of tourists each year.Story continuesWhen we talk about the potential of the tourism industry, travel titans in the industry have an influence on the perception of countries worldwide. When you start planning a trip, your first contacts are usually travel industry companies, be it airlines, hotels, or travel agencies. Now, if these interactions are smooth and positive, you're already stepping into your journey with a smile. In your mind, the destination becomes associated with friendliness.But imagine the reverse. A hiccup with your flight or hotel booking could cast a shadow on your view of the destination, tagging it as 'unfriendly' even before you've had a chance to interact with the locals. It's fascinating how these early experiences with travel giants can frame our perception of an entire country.Take airlines, for instance. Companies such as Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), United Airlines, and Ryanair connect people from different parts of the globe. Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), for example, manages over 4,000 daily flights in more than 275 places worldwide. They're also known for being on time more than any other North American airline. Every year, about 200 million customers fly with Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL). That's what makes Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) one of the top-rated airlines in America.Hotel chains like Marriott International (NYSE:MAR), Hilton Worldwide, and InterContinental Hotels Group also play an important role in shaping the narrative of friendliness. A tourist’s impression of friendliness often starts with their accommodation – the reception at the front desk, the housekeeping service, and the local recommendations from the concierge – all these interactions shape a guest’s perception.Let's take the example of Marriott International (NYSE:MAR). As one of the world's most expansive hotel chains, Marriott International (NYSE:MAR) stretches across more than 138 countries. It not only offers travelers a comfortable place to rest their heads but also serves as a gateway to connect with and explore diverse destinations worldwide. This hospitality titan, with Marriott International’s (NYSE:MAR) consistent service and commitment to guest satisfaction, often sets the tone for travelers’ experiences in these countries.Online travel agencies also have their roles in shaping the friendliness perception of a country. Countries that offer accessible online booking systems often seem more approachable and easier to navigate.Consider Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB), a platform that streamlines the booking process for travelers with more than 6 million active listings spanning over 100,000 cities worldwide. The user-friendly interface of the Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) app allows travelers to secure a booking in less than 11 minutes, on average.Imagine a country without access to convenient online booking platforms like Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB), or with platforms that are hard to use. Problems like booking difficulties, poor customer service, or inaccurate local stay information can sour a traveler's initial impression. This negative start can lead tourists to perceive their destination as less friendly, even before they've set foot in the country.25 Most Unfriendly Countries in the WorldFedor Selivanov/Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of the ""Most Unfriendly Countries in the World,"" we based our ranking on three credible indexes: the Visa Acceptance Index, the Global Peace Index, and the Danger and Safety Index.Each of these indexes gives us different insights into how friendly or 'unfriendly' a country might seem to outsiders. We selected countries that were included in all these indexes. Each country's score was determined based on a weighted average of its positions in these three indexes. Specifically, the weight distribution was as follows:Visa Acceptance Index: 40%Global Peace Index: 30%Danger and Safety Index: 30%We first normalized each country's score within each index to range from 1 (most unfriendly) to 24 (least unfriendly). We then applied the weights mentioned above to calculate the overall 'unfriendliness' score for each country.The countries were subsequently ranked in ascending order of their friendliness scores, with the country possessing the lowest score ranked (1) as the 'most unfriendly'.When we refer to a country as 'unfriendly' in our article, we're basing it on these three indexes. It's a mix of how easy it is to visit the country, how safe it is, and how well it's set up for tourists.Below is our list of the most unfriendly countries in the world.25 Most Unfriendly Countries in the World25. BeninInsider Monkey Score: 24 The high poverty rates, reports of crime, and instances of civil unrest in Benin can make it seem less than welcoming to outsiders. Travel advisories warning about risks in certain regions further contribute to its image as an unfriendly country.24. GuyanaInsider Monkey Score: 23Despite its natural beauty, Guyana struggles with high crime rates and social unrest, creating a potentially unwelcoming environment for tourists. The lack of reliable public services and violent crimes add to its image of an unfriendly country.23. Saudi ArabiaInsider Monkey Score: 23The strict laws and customs in Saudi Arabia might seem overwhelming to those unfamiliar with its culture. However, Saudi Arabia is gradually opening up to tourism, with historic sites like Al Khobar and the futuristic city project NEOM.22. AlgeriaInsider Monkey Score: 22Ongoing political unrest and irregular terrorist attacks in Algeria can create a sense of hostility. Travel restrictions in certain areas, coupled with occasional social unrest and strikes, contribute to the country's unfriendly reputation.21. Burkina FasoInsider Monkey Score: 21Despite its vibrant cultural scenes, Burkina Faso faces increasing security threats and political unrest, which can create an hostile environment for visitors. Risks include terrorism, crime, and kidnapping, particularly for those traveling outside the capital, Ouagadougou.20. TurkmenistanInsider Monkey Score: 20The closed-off nature of Turkmenistan, due to its strict regulations and limited press freedom, can make it seem unfriendly to outsiders. Difficulties in obtaining travel permits and restrictions on independent travel further add to this perception.19. Guinea-BissauInsider Monkey Score: 19 Guinea-Bissau grapples with frequent political turmoil, widespread corruption, and poor public services, making it one of the most unfriendly countries for expats and tourists. The safety concerns, crimes, and lack of tourism infrastructure contribute to the country's unfriendly image.18. VenezuelaInsider Monkey Score: 18 The ongoing political and economic crisis in Venezuela, along with high crime rates and shortages of basic necessities, contribute to its reputation as an unfriendly country. The often-volatile political situation and concerns about safety can make traveling to the country challenging.17. NigerInsider Monkey Score: 17Niger faces significant challenges due to its socio-economic conditions, harsh desert environment, and the risk of terrorist attacks, especially near its borders. These issues, along with poor infrastructure and health services, create an intimidating environment for visitors and make Niger one of the most unfriendly countries in 2023.16. PakistanInsider Monkey Score: 16While Pakistan is known for its breathtaking landscapes, it grapples with political instability and security concerns, creating a potential perception of hostility. Incidences of terrorism and crime add to the perception of Pakistan as an unfriendly country.15. MyanmarInsider Monkey Score: 15Myanmar's ongoing political unrest, including military coups and widespread protests, results in an unstable environment. Reports of human rights abuses and travel restrictions, especially in conflict-affected regions, contribute to the country's unfriendly reputation.14. RussiaInsider Monkey Score: 14Despite its rich history and cultural heritage, Russia might come off as unfriendly to some due to its political tension with certain countries and colder climate. It also has strict visa regulations and reported intolerance towards certain group, which contributes to the country’s reputation as challenging and unwelcoming. Moscow, a city in Russia, is also ranked as one of the most unfriendly cities in the world. 13. CameroonInsider Monkey Score: 13Despite Cameroon's remarkable cultural and geographic diversity, it can seem unfriendly due to political unrest and increased crime rates. The threats of kidnapping and violence, especially in the northern region, along with frequent protests and strikes, make the environment more unfriendly for tourists.12. EritreaInsider Monkey Score: 12Eritrea, despite its rich cultural heritage and stunning coastline, faces international isolation and human rights issues. Its strict travel regulations, wrongful detentions, mandatory military service, and limited freedom of expression contribute to a perception of an unwelcoming atmosphere for tourists.11. MaliInsider Monkey Score: 11Mali is steeped in historical significance, but it's plagued by frequent terrorist attacks, high crime rate, and political instability. These risks, alongside severe travel advisories and the existence of dangerous areas controlled by extremist groups, make Mali a challenging destination for outsiders.Click to continue reading and see the 10 Most Unfriendly Countries in the World.Suggested Articles:30 Most Visited Cities by American Tourists20 Happiest Cities in the World35 Best Destinations in the World for Cultural TourismDisclosure.

In fact, an increasing number of Americans are traveling and more people are planning to go on vacations through 2023.This comes despite higher air ticket prices and hotel tariffs as people are ready to shell out more. Traveling, which had almost come to a standstill in 2020 due to the pandemic, rebounded strongly in 2022, and this year, too, people want to travel at least as much as last year.More Americans TravelingAccording to a Forbes Advisor survey, 87% of the respondents plan to travel as much as they did in 2022, while 49% plan to travel more. Understandably, young people are more inclined toward traveling.Among those who plan to travel more, 59% are between 18 and 26. Among them, 45% traveled at least once or twice in 2022, while 22% traveled on three or more occasions.This means a large number of people plan to travel more than three to four times this year. Also, all types of trips are popular this year. The survey also shows that more than 50% of those traveling plan to go on vacations or pleasure trips, which include road trips, beach vacations and trips.High prices have been posing a major challenge for the travel industry but people are willing to spend more knowing that costs are a lot higher than in 2022. Among those who plan to travel this year, 45% have a higher budget, while 28% have the same budget. Most people plan to spend $4,000 or more on traveling and vacationing this year, while 28% plan to have a budget between $2,000 and $3,999.Hotels, airlines and other leisure companies had a solid holiday season in 2022 as millions of Americans went on vacations after staying almost indoors for two years owing to the pandemic. The trend seems to be continuing this year too.Inflation, too, has been showing signs of easing and the Fed has finally paused its interest rate hikes. Lower borrowing rates thus bode well for both the vacationers and the travel industry. Given this situation, it would be ideal to invest in hotels, leisure, and airline stocks, which tend to benefit from the travel boom.Story continuesOur ChoicesGiven this situation, it would be wise to invest in these four stocks.

The research finds that newlyweds would rather gift-givers skip traditional presents in favor of financial gifts toward the purchase of a home, but many feel obligated to register for traditional gifts they don't want.Among those surveyed who have created a wedding registry in the last 24 months, 85% say they would have preferred to have received money toward a down payment on a home, rather than a physical gift. If they could do it again differently, they would – 80% say that if they were creating a gift registry today, they would include an option for people to gift them money toward home buying expenses, such as a down payment, a mortgage payment or closing costs.But despite the desire for financial gifts to be used toward a home purchase, both newlyweds and gift givers are stuck in a traditional gift-giving cycle.People are registering for – and giving – gifts they don't want out of obligationEighty-two percent of those surveyed who've recently created a wedding registry say they felt obligated to register for traditional gifts, such as home furnishings, dishware, etc., with 53% saying they felt very obligated to register for traditional gifts.This is causing most (88%) of those surveyed who've recently created a wedding registry to register for gifts they didn't really want:46% registered for gifts they didn't want because they felt obligated to have traditional gifts on their registry40% registered for gifts they didn't want because their fiancé/spouse wanted them35% registered for gifts they didn't want, but planned to return them for money to use on what they really wantStory continuesThe obligation to traditional gifting goes both ways:80% of those who've recently created a wedding registry say they've felt obligated to buy a traditional gift for a wedding they attended70% say they would prefer to buy a traditional gift for a wedding they attendTimes, they are-a-changinSeventy-two percent of those surveyed who've recently created a wedding registry included options on their registry for people to contribute financially to a specific large-ticket item, such as a honeymoon, and 22% said they didn't include this option, but would have liked to.This corresponds with more people being willing to give money toward home buying as a gift at weddings they attend, with 30% of those surveyed now being open to giving such gifts:16% would prefer to gift money toward a home down payment14% have no preference between a traditional gift and money toward home buying expenses""Over the last few years, homebuyers have been facing a number of challenges, most notably around affordability due to high home prices and mortgage rates,"" said Clare Trapasso, executive news editor at Realtor.com®. ""We're seeing buyers get creative with how they cobble together the necessary financials, from tapping into down payment assistance programs, to asking for help from family and friends. Adding a home buying gift option to a wedding registry is a great way for people to crowd-source these often hard-to-come-by funds. It allows their loved ones to celebrate one of the biggest moments of their lives while helping them to achieve homeownership.""With mortgage rates expected to remain elevated, putting pressure on buyers' budgets at least through the end of this year, coupled with continued low for-sale inventory, competition for housing will remain strong and buyers will need to continue getting creative to afford to buy this year.Survey MethodologyThe research was conducted by Censuswide, with 2,291 respondents in the U.S. including 755 people who have created a wedding registry in the last 24 months.

Available in two paid tiers.NEW YORK, June 27, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Verizon Business is elevating its fixed-wireless business internet offering with all new native security features and a cloud-based router management dashboard, giving customers remote self-service capability to address performance, security, and visibility needs in one centralized location. The solutions are available to businesses of all sizes as simple-to-add enhancements to Verizon fixed-wireless plans, with nothing to install and no special equipment or in-house IT support necessary.Verizon Business Internet PortalAt no additional charge to Verizon Business Internet customers, the Verizon Business Internet Portal allows businesses to monitor and self-manage their entire portfolio of fixed-wireless connections, without relying on service calls or IT experts. The Portal is accessible from virtually anywhere via verizon.com and using a customer’s existing My Business credentials. The cloud-based interface means large enterprises can centrally monitor and control vast device deployments, and small and medium businesses can easily scale up as they grow, without depending on IT support to manage connections.Verizon Business Internet Portal capabilities include:Performance monitoring and diagnostics for all routers, regardless of manufacturer: router online/offline status, signal strength, speed testing, and Wi-Fi health check with performance management, including historical data reporting, performance improvement recommendations, and equipment upgrade capabilitiesCritical network-management features: remote Wi-Fi password management, device rebooting, and enhanced view and management of devices connected to your network, including IP addressesAdvanced settings: local administration lock, save/restore router configurations, IP passthrough, firewall settingsBulk configuration management for customers with multiple Verizon Business Internet linesStory continuesThe Portal’s remote accessibility is also a significant advantage for hybrid or highly distributed work environments. Firms can manage equipment spanning their own physical locations and the work-from-home/WFX deployments afforded to remote employees. Beyond being able to monitor and make network-critical changes through the Portal, organizations can also order replacement devices for routers needing to be upgraded.Verizon Business Internet SecurityHoused in the Business Internet Portal, Verizon Business Internet Security comes in two tiers of service as a paid enhancement to LTE or 5G Business Internet plans. The embedded, network-native security features can be activated immediately with nothing new to install, and management is clear and intuitive via the Verizon Business Internet Portal. The two tiers of VBIS service are:Verizon Business Internet Security Plus ($10 per line per month), which includes ransomware protection, phishing prevention, anti-malware, malicious website blocking, security insights and reporting via the Verizon Business Internet Portal, and more.Verizon Business Internet Security Preferred ($20 per line per month), which includes all Plus features plus enhanced, customizable protections such as content filtering, block/allow for specific URLs, block/allow for specific IP addresses, and advanced security configuration enablement via the Verizon Business Internet Portal.Verizon Business Internet Security solutions offer protection for devices on the same router and can block fixed devices from visiting malicious websites or downloading malicious content, a common challenge for small and medium businesses especially. By placing a layer of security at the Internet gateway, threats can be intercepted before ever reaching the end device. The Verizon Business Internet Portal logs and reports blocked threats, so you can see your Verizon Business Internet Security solutions at work for you every day.Executive and Analyst CommentsDebika Bhattacharya, Chief Product Officer, Verizon Business, on the Verizon Business Internet Portal and Verizon Business Internet Security:“With these enhancements, Verizon Business' fixed-wireless offering has never been more compelling or more distinguished in the marketplace. The Verizon Business Internet Portal and Verizon Business Internet Security make management and cybersecurity simple, easy to use and accessible for our business customers. There's no installation, no IT support, and no headaches, and users gain more control and better visibility into the security and performance of their connections and devices, all on one dashboard.”Debika Bhattacharya, on Verizon Business Internet Security:“Verizon Business Internet Security can benefit companies of any size. Large enterprises can secure vast deployments of equipment with an embedded layer of defense that can be activated immediately and seamlessly. But these solutions are especially beneficial for small and medium-sized businesses, which don’t always have the resources or internal expertise to manage their security. Verizon’s Data Breach Investigations Report released earlier this month revealed that the cost of cyberattacks like business email compromise and ransomware are on the rise, with the latter doubling over the last two years. This is especially worrying for small and medium-sized businesses, considering they are more likely than large businesses to have their credentials stolen (54% to 37%), resulting in other malicious actions like ransomware. Verizon Business Internet Security helps head off these vulnerabilities at the pass by taking the guesswork out of cybersecurity set-up and offering protection the second our customers turn it on.”Jason Leigh, Research Manager for Mobility &amp; 5G Services at IDC:“Business fixed wireless access [FWA] connections are expected to grow at a 39% CAGR over the next five years, reaching 5.3 million business FWA lines in use by 2027, with much of that growth coming from multi-location businesses, such as banking, healthcare, construction, and retail. Yet for those businesses utilizing multiple FWA lines, deployment and oversight of FWA has previously been a case-by-case, site-by-site process. A singular, cloud-based management portal allows a business, no matter the size of its IT operations, to easily monitor and configure the entire scope of its FWA connectivity remotely — from router passwords to policy management — and is essential to realizing the flexibility, scalability, and ease of use promise that FWA offers,” says Jason Leigh, Research Manager for Mobility &amp; 5G Services at IDC. “And incorporating a network-native security service streamlines the ability of businesses to secure their operations, and further accelerates the value that businesses can realize through the adoption of FWA.”Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE, Nasdaq: VZ) was formed on June 30, 2000 and is one of the world’s leading providers of technology and communications services. Headquartered in New York City and with a presence around the world, Verizon generated revenues of $133.6 billion in 2021. The company offers data, video and voice services and solutions on its award-winning networks and platforms, delivering on customers’ demand for mobility, reliable network connectivity, security and control.VERIZON’S ONLINE MEDIA CENTER: News releases, stories, media contacts and other resources are available at verizon.com/news.

Nearly 3,000 new households and businesses will have access to Verizon’s Fios network as part of one of the biggest network upgrades in our history.“Verizon is focused on delivering high-speed internet service and the major economic benefits that it can provide, especially in unserved and underserved areas,” said Kwame Trotman, Vice President of Wireline Network Operations-Mid-Atlantic South Region for Verizon. ‘Our commitment to the Commonwealth of Virginia continues as we offer residents of these counties access to our 100% fiber Fios internet service to fuel how they work, live and play.”This rural broadband project is built in partnership with the commonwealth of Virginia and the counties, in conjunction with the Federal Communications Commission, to deliver fast, fiber broadband service to residents in rural parts of the commonwealth. The $15 million expansion in Caroline and Greensville includes $6.1 million in funding as part of the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA). More than 120 miles of fiber – the equivalent of running fiber between Richmond and Virginia Beach – will be deployed in connection with the build.“We are delighted to be awarded this grant which will improve and enhance Greensville County’s infrastructure towards building a true 21st century gigabit-class network,” said Dr. Charlette T. Woolridge, Greensville County Administrator. “Greensville County has historically faced challenges due to slow, sporadic and limited broadband services.

However, the company does not expect the additional restrictions to have an immediate material impact on its results.""With an update on export controls now expected, investors will assess just how limiting the new rules will be for chip makers' sales,"" said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets, Hargreaves Lansdown.""A handful of tech companies pack a huge punch on Wall Street due to their sheer size, so any wobble in confidence reverberates on indices.""Rising expectations over the advancements in AI have helped Wall Street climb this year, with Nvidia at the pole position on the S&amp;P 500 index, gaining 187% so far this year.But the sharp rise in shares has also sparked doubts over lofty valuations.Nvidia is trading at 47 times its expected 12-months earnings, while AMD is at a 31.2 multiple and Intel at 31.8, way above the S&amp;P 500's multiple at 19, according to Refinitiv data.Story continuesThe Philadelphia chip index has surged more than 42% so far this year, far ahead of the benchmark index's 14% rise.Across the Atlantic, Nordic Semiconductor, Dutch chipmaker ASML, Milan-listed STMicroelectronics, however, closed between 2.3% and 6.4% higher.(Reporting by Medha Singh in Bengaluru; additional reporting by Akash Sriram in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur and Vinay Dwivedi)]"

That is because the Jan 19, 2024 $15.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Fox Corporation shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Fox Corporation is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Broadcast Radio and Television  industry that ranks in the Bottom 22% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while five have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 79 cents per share to 71 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Fox Corporation right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

(AP) — Attorneys for Gov. Ron DeSantis, a state agency and his appointees to a revamped board that governs Disney World are asking a judge to dismiss a federal lawsuit in which Disney claims its free speech rights were violated by the takeover of its governing district. The lawsuit states this happened in retaliation for Disney's opposition to the so-called “Don't Say Gay” legislation championed by the Florida governor.Attorneys for DeSantis, the secretary of the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity and the DeSantis appointees to the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District filed motions Monday asking that Disney's lawsuit in federal court in Tallahassee either be dismissed, put on hold or that they be dropped as defendants.The federal court lacks jurisdiction over the Republican governor and the state agency's secretary, who are immune to the lawsuit, and the governor and secretary don't enforce any of the laws at issue so Disney lacks standing to pursue its claims, attorneys for the state of Florida argued in their motion to dismiss.The motion also argues that DeSantis has legislative immunity which protects him from actions taken while conducting “legitimate legislative activity.”“Although Disney has grabbed headlines by suing the Governor, Disney — like many litigants before it who have challenged Florida’s laws — has no basis for doing so,” the motion states.In their motion, the DeSantis' appointees to the Disney World governing board asked a federal judge to either dismiss the case or put it on hold until after some of the same issues raised in the federal lawsuit are resolved in state court where the board has a lawsuit pending against Disney.The DeSantis appointees took over the Disney World governing board earlier this year following a yearlong feud between the company and DeSantis. The fight began last year after Disney, beset by significant pressure internally and externally, publicly opposed a state law banning classroom lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in early grades, a policy critics call “Don’t Say Gay.”Story continuesAs punishment, DeSantis took over the district through legislation passed by Florida lawmakers and appointed a new board of supervisors to oversee municipal services for the sprawling theme parks and hotels. But before the new board came in, the company made agreements with previous oversight board members who were Disney supporters that stripped the new supervisors of their authority over design and construction.In response, DeSantis and Florida lawmakers passed legislation that repealed those agreements.Disney sued DeSantis and the five-member board, asking a federal judge to void the governor’s takeover of the theme park district, as well as the oversight board’s actions, on the grounds they were violations of the company’s free speech rights.The board sued Disney in state court in an effort to maintain its control of construction and design at Disney World.DeSantis, who announced his campaign for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination in May, has used the fight with Disney to burnish his “anti-woke” credentials and demonstrate his ability to push a conservative agenda.___Follow Mike Schneider on Twitter at @MikeSchneiderAP]"

Last May, the economy added 339,000 jobs, well above the consensus target of 190,000. On paper, this print sounds incredibly favorable for the broader sentiment. However, it also means that more dollars chase after fewer goods, which is inflationary. Therefore, high-potential stocks before a rate hike might outperform in the long run.In addition, the real M2 money stock – while falling sharply against its peak – continues to be elevated relative to pre-pandemic norms. Put another way, there’s still plenty of money floating around due to Covid-19-related stimulus and support programs. The Fed has to address this matter. Otherwise, inflation may run indefinitely hot, which then bolsters stocks to buy pre-Fed decisions.Of course, both individual Americans and policymakers prefer kicking the can down the road. That’s one of the main risk factors here. Nevertheless, economic stability is at risk, the central bank must get serious. On that note, below are stocks to invest in before Fed rate hikes.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDUKDuke Energy$91.65MCYMercury General$31.26MTBM&amp;T Bank$122.15Stocks to Buy Before Rate Hike: Duke Energy (DUK)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Generally speaking, a large swathe of market sectors tends to respond well to falling interest rates. Basically, this framework implies expansion at a lower cost. However, if you anticipate the opposite trajectory, utility giant Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) represents one of the best stocks to buy before rate hike. Cynically, that’s because rate hike or not, customers will need to pay their utility bills.Put another way, DUK ranks among the stocks to buy pre-Fed decision because it enjoys a natural monopoly. Due to the steep barrier to entry of the utilities sector, prospective competitors don’t even bother trying. Therefore, it gives Duke breathing room.Story continuesSure enough, like other utility plays, Duke doesn’t enjoy the most sterling financials. However, it does deliver consistent profitability, again because people have little choice but to pay up. That’s why it’s one of the high-potential stocks before rate hike.Finally, Wall Street analysts peg DUK as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $105.30, implying nearly 16% upside potential.Mercury General (MCY)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Los Angeles, California, Mercury General (NYSE:MCY) and its subsidiaries represent a multiple-line insurance organization. Predominantly, according to its public profile, Mercury offers personal automobile and homeowners insurance through a network of independent producers in many states. As well, it offers renters and business insurance. Since the January opener, MCY slipped over 10%.Despite the red ink, MCY should be one of the top stocks to buy before Fed action. While Mercury doesn’t quite have a natural monopoly, it benefits from a hostage or captive audience. For example, most states in the U.S. require some form of auto insurance. With relatively few trusted players in the game, Mercury enjoys a large, realistically addressable market. For full transparency, the company’s major drawback is its financials. While insurance companies also don’t distinguish themselves usually in this field, Mercury appears particularly challenged.That said, Raymond James analyst Charles Peters pegs MCY a buy with a $40 price target. If it gets there, we’re talking about nearly 30% growth potential. Thus, it’s one of the stocks to invest in before Fed rate hikes.M&amp;T Bank (MTB)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comEasily the riskiest stocks to buy before rate hike on this list, M&amp;T Bank (NYSE:MTB) inherently suffers a credibility cloud. A bank holding firm, M&amp;T operates over a thousand branches in 12 states across the eastern U.S. Its footprint extends from Maine to Southern Virginia. In other words, it’s a regional banking firm, which of course poses risks.On one hand, three regional banks failed this year. Plus, the first two failures temporarily sparked panic though the federal government responded quickly to the crisis. However, it’s important to realize that while the mainstream media hasn’t focused on the story as much, the crisis itself isn’t over. One of the concerns is that future shocks – such as deteriorating commercial real estate – could disproportionately impact smaller entities.However, M&amp;T ranks among the larger regional institutions. In addition, a possible combination of economic stability and higher rates could help lift its profitability. Lastly, analysts peg MTB as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $152.63, implying 25% upside potential. Therefore, we could be looking at one of the high-potential stocks before rate hike.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

The MG software facilitates efficient simulation and real-time tuning of multi-devices, incorporating complex RF sub-circuits and netlists that employ layout parasitic extraction files. Furthermore, the software framework encompasses model verification and report generation.By streamlining data organization, simulation and display, this software solution enables engineers to dedicate more time and effort to the crucial task of RF modeling. With improved efficiency and accuracy, Samsung Foundry is poised to enhance its process design kits and accelerate the development and launch of innovative semiconductor products.Electronic devices form the fulcrum of Internet of Things (IoT) services, wireless devices, data centers and 5G technologies. The rapid adoption of these devices is increasing the demand for electronic testing equipment. Further, technological advancements in mobile communications, semiconductors and automotive markets are likely to drive growth. Moreover, the rising demand for power management applications is a key catalyst for Keysight.

That is because the Aug 18, 2023 $40 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Colgate-Palmolive shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Colgate-Palmolive is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Soap and Cleaning Materials industry that ranks in the Top 10 of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, four analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one analyst has revised the estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 74 cents per share to 75 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Colgate-Palmolive right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. In other words, investors can purchase Comcast's shares before the 3rd of July in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 26th of July.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.29 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$1.16 per share to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Comcast has a trailing yield of 2.8% on the current share price of $41.48. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. As a result, readers should always check whether Comcast has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. Check out our latest analysis for Comcast If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. It paid out 84% of its earnings as dividends last year, which is not unreasonable, but limits reinvestment in the business and leaves the dividend vulnerable to a business downturn. We'd be concerned if earnings began to decline. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 42% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with shrinking earnings are tricky from a dividend perspective. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. With that in mind, we're discomforted by Comcast's 22% per annum decline in earnings in the past five years. When earnings per share fall, the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid also falls.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Comcast has lifted its dividend by approximately 14% a year on average. The only way to pay higher dividends when earnings are shrinking is either to pay out a larger percentage of profits, spend cash from the balance sheet, or borrow the money. Comcast is already paying out 84% of its profits, and with shrinking earnings we think it's unlikely that this dividend will grow quickly in the future.The Bottom LineIs Comcast an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? The payout ratios are within a reasonable range, implying the dividend may be sustainable. Declining earnings are a serious concern, however, and could pose a threat to the dividend in future. Overall, it's hard to get excited about Comcast from a dividend perspective.However if you're still interested in Comcast as a potential investment, you should definitely consider some of the risks involved with Comcast. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 3 warning signs for Comcast you should know about.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

With the support of these digital case workers:More than 65 percent of survey respondents said they obtained Internet access or a computer or tablet at home; among Hispanic and Black Americans, this increased to 72 percent.More than 85 percent of all respondents said they used the Internet more frequently.Almost half surveyed obtained better healthcare, and 40 percent received support with basic needs like food, rent, and housing.1 in 3 found a new job or earned a higher income.""The positive impact Digital Navigators have is astounding. Their success proves that to close the digital divide we need to connect with people in person to grow their comfort and confidence with technology and going online,"" said Bret Perkins, Comcast Senior Vice President of External &amp; Government Affairs. ""By funding the creation of a Digital Navigators program with our dedicated community partners, we are one step closer to closing the digital divide in Tallahassee and making sure that everyone here has the access and skills needed to take advantage of the Internet’s vast resources.""Story continuesAccording to the National Skills Coalition, 92% of jobs require digital skills yet nearly one-third of U.S. workers do not have foundational digital skills — disproportionally impacting low-income communities and people of color.The Rotary Club, Neighborhood Association, Leon County Schools and additional supporting partners will launch #TallahasseeConnects, a nine-month campaign to train and dispatch Digital Navigators to help Southside residents sign up for free or low-cost in-home internet services, including the federal Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) and Comcast’s Internet Essentials program.Digital Navigators will also encourage residents to undergo digital skills training at the Apalachee Ridge Estates Technology &amp; Learning Center, which has been a Comcast Lift Zone since May 2021. Lift Zones are WiFi connected spaces at the facilities of Comcast community partners where residents and students can get online.""We are thrilled about expanding our partnership with Comcast today,"" said Christic Henry, President of the Greater Apalachee Ridge Estates Neighborhood Association. ""Not only did we launch our Tallahassee Connected campaign, but the Inaugural Digital Equity Forum allowed community stakeholders and residents to gather and speak openly about the challenges of not being connected and how we can work together to resolve digital inequities.""About Comcast CorporationComcast Corporation (Nasdaq: CMCSA) is a global media and technology company.

Built-in prompts help customers get the best results while helping reduce undesirable side effects such as factual errors and bias. With Oracle Cloud HCM, customers use their own data to refine models for their specific business needs – each customer's dedicated generative AI models are only tuned on the customer's own proprietary data.

The new generative AI capabilities can summarize the key elements of content for simple and impactful consumption. An example includes providing a summary of the employee's performance for submission in the employee's regular review cycle based on feedback gathered across the year from the employee, peers, or managers, and goal progress and achievements.""We have already identified more than 100 high-value-added scenarios for generative AI in HR.

Oracle will put a button on many of the fields in the software that will automatically generate draft text for things like job listings or performance goals.Putting the AI assistant in the form of a button rather than chatbot that answers open-ended prompts written by human users is meant to ensure the buttons ""produce a good result and a safe result,"" said Rich Buchheim, vice president of product management for Oracle Adaptive Intelligence Applications.Buchheim said the resulting text will still need to be approved by a human.""We don't expect generative AI is going to write your goals for you.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis of the key to franchise growth and see the top 5 franchises, head straight to the 5 Biggest Franchises In The World.The world has witnessed the remarkable rise of franchises, a business model that has thrived for decades and propelled numerous brands to unprecedented heights. With their tried-and-true formula, these franchises have cemented their status as global behemoths, capturing the hearts and wallets of consumers worldwide. From renowned fast-food empires to iconic retail giants, the most prominent franchises like Starbucks, McDonald's, and The UPS Store, among others, have become synonymous with success, leveraging their devoted customer base, a distinct brand identity, and a proven blueprint for expansion. These powerhouses stand as a testament to the enduring allure and profitability of the franchise model, exerting their influence and dominating industries on a global scale. Replication and Expansion: The Key to Franchise Growth When it comes to growing a franchise, replication, and expansion are the keys to success. By replicating successful models and expanding into new markets, company owners can increase their reach and profitability. Replication not only ensures consistency but also maximizes profitability. Standardized procedures and practices streamline operations, which leads to reduced costs and increased income. According to recent financial statistics, franchises that use replication strategies have seen a 34% profit increase. Expansion, on the other hand, opens up new growth opportunities. Franchises can explore new markets and product lines to stay ahead of the curve and adapt to changing consumer needs. By expanding into international markets, franchises can tap into the growing global economy and increase their revenue streams. Recent financial data shows that franchises that have expanded their reach have seen a 45% increase in profits. Story continuesInternational Influence: Franchises Making a Global Impact In today's global economy, franchises are a lucrative business model. McDonald's, for example, reported a revenue of $23.18 billion in 2022, a testament to its success on a global scale. Similarly, Starbucks reported a net income of $3.28 billion in 2022, indicating its popularity among coffee lovers worldwide.

With the potential to expand their customer base and increase revenue growth, theses top franchises in the world are set to continue significantly impacting the worldwide economy. According to the International Franchise Association (IFA), the franchise industry has been experiencing consistent growth in recent years. In 2021, the total economic output of the franchise sector was estimated to be $787.5 billion in the United States alone. The franchise industry also employed over 8.3 million people, significantly contributing to job creation. When it comes to profitability, franchising can offer attractive financial opportunities for franchisees and franchisors. Franchise profitability is predominantly influenced by average sales, typically falling between $400,000 and $1.4 million annually for traditional brick and mortar franchises, as stated by the American Franchise Academy.However, financial performance can differ based on factors such as industry, location, and the specific franchise system. Each franchise's profitability may vary, so it's crucial to consider these individual factors when assessing potential returns on investment.Navigating the Financial Landscape of Franchise Investments Franchises, often counted among the largest and most profitable businesses in the world, offer enticing prospects for financial success. Opening a franchise entails a significant financial commitment, including franchise fees and setup expenses that vary depending on the franchise. Initial investments can range from modest amounts, such as $24,000 for Century 21 Real Estate, to substantial sums like the $118 million required for a Marriott Hotel franchise.Beyond the initial investment, franchisees bear ongoing financial responsibilities, including annual licensing fees and royalties paid throughout their business venture. These financial commitments are integral to the franchise model, ensuring the necessary support from the franchisor while offering the potential for considerable returns to driven entrepreneurs.  With that out of the way, we move on to the list of the biggest franchises in the world.

(NYSE:MCD) is looking to reignite its growth by enhancing the customer experience.Armed with the revised ""Accelerating the Arches"" strategy, which was announced in January, the fast-food giant is strategically leveraging digital channels and revamping its menu to cater to evolving consumer preferences.Strategic awakening Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with CVS. Click here to check it out. MCD 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of MCDPeter Lynch Chart of MCDMcDonald's is implementing a strategic awakening with the strategy, aiming to drive growth and enhance the customer experience. For instance, McDonald's and Glovo's strategic partnership is a vital move that aligns with its focus on delivery in driving the business forward. By expanding their existing agreement, both companies aim to enhance the customer experience by providing the convenience of McDelivery through the Glovo platform.With Glovo operating in 25 countries and over 1,500 cities, the partnership may lead to growth and market expansion opportunities. By collaborating with the food delivery service, McDonald's can utilize its technological capabilities and extensive network to ensure a seamless delivery experience for customers and capitalize on growing demand.McDonald's: A Strategic Awakening for Long-Term GrowthSource: McDonalds Aspiration WorkshopFor growth, McDonald's is maximizing marketing. The company plans to invest in new, culturally relevant approaches to communicate its brand story, food and purpose effectively. It includes campaigns like the Famous Orders platform, the FIFA World Cup and the Raise Your Arches campaign. McDonald's is concentrating on value creation at every tier of its menu, particularly in the uncertain economic environment. Through engaging and personalized campaigns, its marketing strategy may attract and retain customers, especially among the younger generations.Story continuesAdditionally, enrichment of the core menu may serve as another growth factor for McDonald's. It plans to boost customer demand for familiar and iconic products like the Big Mac, Chicken McNuggets and the McFlurry. The company aims to improve these classics and sees a significant opportunity with coffee to leverage the McCafe brand. The company may successfully address consumer preferences by focusing on both core icons and scaling emerging offerings like the McSpicy and McCrispy Chicken Sandwiches.Further, McDonald's plans to double down on the four Ds: digital, delivery, drive thru and restaurant development. It recognizes the importance of digital channels and a personalized and convenient customer experience. For the objective, its ""MyMcDonald's"" digital experience may serve as a growth engine.McDonald's drive-thru locations remain a competitive advantage, along with successful loyalty programs and partnerships with delivery platforms like UberEats and DoorDash (NYSE:DASH). The company expects digital channels to continue to drive significant sales growth, and it plans to build on that strength by including drive-thru options in new locations. Further, McDonald's may benefit from the accelerated pace of global restaurant openings, focusing on exploring new formats and opportunities for growth.McDonald's: A Strategic Awakening for Long-Term GrowthSource: McDonald's supplemental informationLooking ahead, McDonald's provided an outlook for 2023. The company expects net restaurant unit expansion to increase sales, focusing on opening approximately 1,900 new restaurant units globally. It also anticipates the operating margin to be around 45% and plans to invest in capital expenditures of $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion, primarily directed toward new restaurant unit expansion.McDonald's aims to achieve a free cash flow conversion rate greater than 90%, highlighting its commitment to generating strong cash flow and returning value to shareholders.Forward orientationOne of the elements of McDonald's forward orientation is the board refreshment strategy. With the election of new independent directors, McDonald's focuses on bringing in diverse expertise and perspectives. The new directors may integrate more expertise in digital innovation, brand strategy, sustainabilit, and real estate, aligning with the company's strategic efforts for growth. In recent years, McDonald's has added new board members such as Tony Capuano, Kareem Daniel, Jennifer Taubert and Amy Weaver, each contributing a mix of skills and perspectives.At the product level, McDonald's is adopting a specific antibiotic policy in line with World Health Organization guidelines. Failure to address antimicrobial resistance can severely affect its market value and brand image. Also, considering the increasing concerns about AMR and the potential $100 trillion in lost global production by 2050, it is in McDonald's best interest to proactively address the issue. Implementing responsible policies throughout its supply chain may benefit the company in attaining its strategic objectives.Notably, the resilience of the McDonald's brand and its ability to drive growth are also crucial elements in its forward orientation. Despite challenges such as inflation, supply chain issues, labor availability and geopolitical tensions, the company is implementing organizational shifts to leverage its scale more effectively, reduce silos and drive innovation to support its long-term financial performance. This can be observed in its first-quarter results.McDonald's: A Strategic Awakening for Long-Term GrowthSource: First-quarter 2023 resultsIn line with the changing consumer landscape, McDonald's has embraced digital transformation, integrating digital and physical experiences. The company has introduced initiatives such as the MyMcDonald's Rewards program, which has gained significant traction with approximately 50 million members across major markets. Additionally, McDonald's has prioritized digital transactions, with 40% occurring digitally.From a financial perspective, the company has a strong balance sheet and a history of returning capital to shareholders through dividends. It has consistently increased dividends for 46 consecutive years and plans to continue this practice. Interestingly, there are no plans for changes to dividend practices or stock splits, as the focus remains on driving shareholder value. Fundamentally, restaurant margins are increasing year overyear at the ground level, which may support the dividend yield and stock price appreciation over the long term.McDonald's: A Strategic Awakening for Long-Term GrowthSource: McDonald's annual reportRisks and downsidesA significant risk attached to the strategy is McDonald's failure to execute it successfully. Any failure will adversely impact its ability to capitalize on its global scale, iconic brand, local market presence, business performance and market share.Investments in enhancing the customer experience, including technology integration and digital engagement, also carry risks. The investments, which are speculative as McDonald's focuses on improving service models, strengthening customer relationships and expanding delivery initiatives, may lead to different results. It may impact profitability, food quality and preference and customer satisfaction, leading to failure to generate the intended benefits.McDonald's faces intense competition in the informal eating out segment. It requires rapid improvements to its products, developing new offerings, managing operations effectively, investing in technology and responding to competitors' actions. Any lagged response may shrink its market share considerably. Last but not least, there is a short-term risk of a downtrend in stock price as most of the recent insider activity is inclined towards the sell side.McDonald's: A Strategic Awakening for Long-Term GrowthTakeawayIn conclusion, McDonald's strategic awakening and forward orientation demonstrate a strong commitment to growth and customer satisfaction. With its ""Accelerating the Arches"" strategy, the company is leveraging partnerships, marketing initiatives, menu enhancements and digital channels to drive its success.Strategic partnerships, such as with Glovo, position the company to tap into the growing demand for delivery services and expand its market reach. With a focus on innovation, resilience and customer-centricity, McDonald's has the potential to maintain its global position, boost market share and create value for shareholders.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date.

Major stock indexes suffered a huge blow last year. However, the Dow suffered the least.In 2022, the Dow fell 8.8% year over year, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite plummeted 19.4% and 33.1%, respectively. Last year, the Fed raised the benchmark interest rate by 4.25% to combat 40-year high inflation.A higher interest rate is detrimental to growth stocks like consumer discretionary and technology. In contrast to the Nasdaq Composite and the S&amp;P 500 indexes, the 30-stock Dow is more inclined to cyclical stocks than growth stocks. Therefore, the index suffered the least. However, the situation has taken a turn in 2023.Dow Changes Course in 2023Several economic data have pointed out that the U.S. economy has been cooling since the beginning of 2023. The inflation rate has dropped to a good extent despite remaining elevated in absolute terms.Consequently, the Fed reduced the magnitude of interest rate hike in 2023. In the June FOMC meeting, the Fed paused the rate hike for the first time after 10 consecutive increases. However, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell warned that more rate raises are expected by the end of this year.A lower rate hike has enabled growth sector like technology, communication services and consumer discretionary to thrive this year. Consequently, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has jumped 28.9% year to date. The broad-market S&amp;P 500 Index has also seen a decent rally of 13.3%. However, the Dow is up a mere 1.8% so far this year.Our Top PicksDefying a tepid Dow, we have narrowed our search to five blue-chip (components of Dow) stocks with strong potential for 2023. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Story continuesThe chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past three months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCaterpillar Inc. CAT has seen year-over-year revenue and earnings growth for nine straight quarters thanks to its cost-saving actions, strong end-market demand and pricing actions that offset the impact of supply-chain snarls and cost pressures. We expect the company’s adjusted earnings per share for 2023 to grow 19% and revenues to rise 7%.The Construction Industries segment of CAT is expected to benefit from the rising construction activities in the United States and other parts of the world. Backed by demand for commodities fueled by the energy-transition trend, a thriving mining sector will aid the Resource Industries segment. Caterpillar’s dividend yield and payout ratio are higher than its peers. A strong liquidity position, investments in expanding services and digital initiatives should help CAT deliver outsized returns.Zacks Rank #1 Caterpillar has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 10% and 28.3%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last seven days.salesforce.com inc. CRM is benefiting from a robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. The rapid adoption of its cloud-based solutions is driving demand for CRM’s products. CRM’s sustained focus on introducing more aligned products as per customer needs is driving its top-line.Continued deal wins in the international market are the other growth drivers. The acquisition of Slack would position salesforce.com as a leader in the enterprise team collaboration solution space and help it compete better with Microsoft’s Teams product. We expect CRM revenues to witness a CAGR of 12.5% during fiscal 2023-2025.Zacks Rank #2 salesforce.com has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 10.5% and 42%, respectively, for the current year (January 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.6% over the last 30 days.McDonald's Corp. MCD continues to impress investors with robust comps growth. MCD’s increased focus on menu innovation and loyalty program expansion is commendable. MCD is also undertaking every effort to drive growth in international markets. Robust digitalization is likely to help McDonald's in driving long-term growth and capture market share. MCD plans to open more than 1,900 restaurants globally in 2023.Zacks Rank #2 McDonald’s has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 7.7% and 9.4%, respectively, for the current year.

PG has benefitted from robust pricing and a favorable mix, along with strength across segments.

PG has witnessed continued strong momentum as reflected by the underlying strength in brands and appropriate strategies, which aided its organic sales growth.Procter &amp; Gamble remains focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. PG’s continued investment in the business alongside its efforts to offset macro cost headwinds and balance top and bottom-line growth underscores its productivity efforts. PG is witnessing cost savings and efficiency improvements across all facets of the business.Zacks Rank #2 Procter &amp; Gamble has an expected earnings growth rate of 4.5% and 8.3%, respectively, for the next fiscal year (June 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next fiscal year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last 30 days.Walmart Inc. WMT has been benefiting from its robust omnichannel operations due to its efforts to enhance both store and online experience.

In that same time, the Transportation sector gained 4.41%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 3.08%.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from United Parcel Service as it approaches its next earnings report date. On that day, United Parcel Service is projected to report earnings of $2.54 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 22.8%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $22.95 billion, down 7.35% from the prior-year quarter.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $10.78 per share and revenue of $96.45 billion, which would represent changes of -16.69% and -3.87%, respectively, from the prior year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for United Parcel Service. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices.

(Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)Teamsters union General President Sean M. O’ Brien told UPS that the union wants a tentative contract agreement within the next week that its leadership can support or that it will demand that the company present its last, best and final contract offer.The escalating rhetoric, included in a Tuesday statement, comes as UPS (NYSE: UPS) purportedly returned to the bargaining table Tuesday morning in Washington without an updated counteroffer to present to the union. According to union sources, O’Brien harshly reiterated that the Teamsters will not work beyond July 31 without a new contract.“When we say the current contract expires July 31, that means we want a new contract in place starting August 1. Not in six months. Not next spring. We demand a historic new contract August 1, with more money in our members’ pockets immediately,” O’Brien said in the statement. “UPS has wasted enough time and hoarded these record profits. Our members want what they have earned.”Any tentative agreement would need to be endorsed by the Teamsters’ national committee before being properly disseminated and voted on by the membership by the end of the current agreement.In a statement, UPS said that “we welcome the Teamsters’ urgency to get a ratified contract in place by August 1. These negotiations affect our people, consumers and businesses across the country, which is a responsibility we take seriously. We’ve been negotiating in good faith to reach an agreement with the Teamsters, and the progress we have made to date reflects our shared commitment to this process.”Before caucusing to review economic proposals, the Teamsters told UPS the union committed to working seven days a week and through the upcoming holiday weekend to get a deal done.“This is why there’s new leadership at the Teamsters. UPS isn’t working with the union’s prior administration, dragging out the bargaining process and submitting to extensions until finally agreeing to a watered-down deal months after the expiration of the contract,” said General Secretary-Treasurer Fred Zuckerman. “This is what hard bargaining looks like. This is labor’s leverage, and the Teamsters are not afraid to use it.”Story continuesBoth sides have already concluded talks on noneconomic issues, tentatively agreeing to language covering 55 agreements. The union presented its initial offer to UPS last Wednesday to cover economic issues such as wages, benefits and changes in worker classifications. The union subsequently rejected UPS’ counteroffer as appalling, saying it calls for meager wage increases and takes workers backward on cost-of-living adjustments.(The story was updated to include UPS’ comments).The post Teamsters president tells UPS union wants tentative agreement in 1 week appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

(UPS) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-parcel-inc-ups-attracting-130008232.html,1687870808,STORY,['UPS'],"[United Parcel Service (UPS) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this package delivery service have returned +0.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Transportation - Air Freight and Cargo industry, which UPS falls in, has gained 2.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.UPS is expected to post earnings of $2.54 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -22.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.78 points to a change of -16.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.41 indicates a change of +5.8% from what UPS is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for UPS.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For UPS, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $22.95 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -7.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $96.45 billion and $99.22 billion estimates indicate -3.9% and +2.9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUPS reported revenues of $22.93 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -6%. EPS of $2.20 for the same period compares with $3.05 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.94 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.05%. The EPS surprise was +0.46%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.UPS is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about UPS. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

322,59384a88-ec71-37e0-9cb9-25521702da4d,AXP,2023-06-28,Credit Cards That Cover Rental Car Insurance,Kiplinger,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/credit-cards-cover-rental-car-192109603.html,1687893669,STORY,"['USB', 'AXP']","[The best credit cards to use for rental car insurance.Should you tick the box for rental car insurance at the Avis, Budget or other rental car counter? Or does your personal auto insurance or credit card already offer this benefit? Given that supplemental insurance for rental cars can cost around $15 to $30 per day or more, it's worth asking these questions first.Figuring out card benefits before you travel is smart. But it can be arduous and confusing to wade through the perks offered by multiple rewards credit cards. A recent study from WalletHub did the heavy lifting for you, comparing the travel benefits of 94 credit cards from the ten largest issuers.But before you compare travel credit cards for rental insurance perks, consider that you might not even need this insurance.Do you need rental car insurance?If you live in the U.S. and own a car for personal use, you likely don't need additional insurance when you rent a car in the U.S. That's because your own auto insurance policy will cover your rental car. But some U.S. states, like Florida and New Hampshire, only require more limited coverage for auto insurance. If your personal auto policy lacks collision and comprehensive insurance, your rental car could be underinsured in an accident or mishap.Some of the better travel credit cards for travel also have rental car coverage in many international locations. But there are exceptions.Best Travel Rewards Credit CardsEither way, you should call both your credit card and your auto insurer before you rent a car, as your policy may have changed. And make sure you understand the different types of auto insurance.Here is a summary of what personal auto insurance and the highest-rated travel credit cards may cover when you rent a car:*Government employees, such as military and postal workers, may have auto insurance coverage as an employment benefit. If you work for a private employer, check if you are covered under a company policy.Story continuesSo, even if you have a personal auto insurance policy, it makes sense to get one of the best travel cards to cover a rental car in the following instances:The car or cars you have insured are worth much less than the car you intend to rent. Since most rental cars are fairly new, this is a common scenario.You plan to rent a car outside of the U.S. or Canada.You are planning to rent a car in the U.S. or abroad while traveling for business.Your personal auto insurance policy offers much less protection than a good travel credit card.Comparing credit card issuersMany financial institutions, like Bank of America or U.S. Bank, offer auto rental benefits. And perks will vary from card-to-card, so it's important to understand the terms of each card.WalletHub found that of the personal credit card issuers in the chart below, Chase Bank offered the best rental car insurance benefits.Bar graph showing scores for each credit card issuer ranking best perks for auto rental.No coverage: Citi, Synchrony and Discover do not offer any car rental coverage on any of their credit cards.Best coverage from Chase and American ExpressChase credit cards offer the best car rental insurance when compared to other issuers. Chase will insure rentals globally, including in countries like Italy and Ireland that other cards may prohibit. Chase also boasts the highest per-vehicle coverage amount (up to $75,000), and coverage extends up to 31 days, whereas most competitors will insure only up to 15 days in your home country.Finally, Chase cards cover damage that occurs when driving on a dirt or gravel road, and damage to tires and rims.The top-scoring personal credit card according to WalletHub is Chase Sapphire Reserve®.All other Chase consumer cards scored second for car rental benefits. For example, the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card has a lower annual fee than the Sapphire Reserve card, but still offers solid travel benefits. For a review of the card, read our detailed article.Third place goes to all American Express personal credit cards. In addition to excellent coverage, American Express offers Premium Car Rental Protection for a small fee per rental period, not per day. This benefit also extends to SUVs and luxury cars, unlike many other plans.

334,877eea19-7cef-3ccb-bce0-20b58a9d157f,OXY,2023-06-28,Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) Has A Pretty Healthy Balance Sheet,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/occidental-petroleum-nyse-oxy-pretty-110013160.html,1687950013,STORY,"['OXY', 'BRK-A']","[The external fund manager backed by Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger, Li Lu, makes no bones about it when he says 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. We note that Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) does have debt on its balance sheet. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?When Is Debt Dangerous?Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together. Check out our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum What Is Occidental Petroleum's Debt?As you can see below, Occidental Petroleum had US$19.1b of debt at March 2023, down from US$26.3b a year prior. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$1.17b, its net debt is less, at about US$17.9b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Healthy Is Occidental Petroleum's Balance Sheet?We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Occidental Petroleum had liabilities of US$6.73b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$34.6b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$1.17b in cash and US$3.27b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$36.9b.This deficit is considerable relative to its very significant market capitalization of US$50.9b, so it does suggest shareholders should keep an eye on Occidental Petroleum's use of debt. Should its lenders demand that it shore up the balance sheet, shareholders would likely face severe dilution.Story continuesIn order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.Occidental Petroleum has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.92. And its EBIT easily covers its interest expense, being 21.5 times the size. So you could argue it is no more threatened by its debt than an elephant is by a mouse. In addition to that, we're happy to report that Occidental Petroleum has boosted its EBIT by 71%, thus reducing the spectre of future debt repayments. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Occidental Petroleum's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. Happily for any shareholders, Occidental Petroleum actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT over the last two years. There's nothing better than incoming cash when it comes to staying in your lenders' good graces.Our ViewHappily, Occidental Petroleum's impressive interest cover implies it has the upper hand on its debt. But truth be told we feel its level of total liabilities does undermine this impression a bit. Zooming out, Occidental Petroleum seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. While debt does bring risk, when used wisely it can also bring a higher return on equity. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Occidental Petroleum (1 shouldn't be ignored!) that you should be aware of before investing here.When all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

It surpassed estimates in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 6.5%.Riding on current business growth and bullish near-term prospects, the company is worth retaining for now.Key Growth CatalystsHealth Care Benefit Shows Potential: Following the colossal acquisition of health insurance giant Aetna for a colossal sum of $70 billion, CVS Health introduced its Health Care Benefits business arm. This segment has been exhibiting continued strong momentum in the past few quarters. In the first quarter, the segment’s revenues increased more than 12%. Overall medical costs were well controlled and in line with expectations. Membership in the first quarter increased by 1 million members versus the prior year’s levels. The upside was primarily driven by the significant increase in the individual exchange business.Health Services Business Gaining Traction: In the first quarter, CVS Health achieved robust revenue growth within Health Services (previously known as the Pharmacy segment). Revenues were up 12.6% in the reported quarter, driven by pharmacy claims growth, specialty pharmacy and brand inflation. The upside was partially offset by continued client price improvements. Total pharmacy claims processed rose 3.7% on a 30-day equivalent basis, attributable to net new business in 2023, increased utilization and the impact of an elevated cough, cold and flu season.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn May 2023, CVS Health completed its acquisition of Oak Street Health. The buyout will broaden CVS' value-based primary care platform and improve patients’ long-term health through better outcomes and lower costs — particularly for those in underserved communities.Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness on a Growth Track: During the first quarter, the company noted that its considerable expansion in retail pharmacy led to significant market share increases over time. This demonstrates the benefit offered to pharmacy patients and the investments made to enhance their experiences. Front-store sales increased by 5% or nearly 8% on a same-store basis, thanks to growth in a number of categories, including consumer health items, personal care and cosmetics.DownsidesCompetitive Landscape: In spite of significant new client wins in the course of a strong selling season, intense competition and tough industry conditions are impediments. Major competitors such as Walgreens, Target and Wal-Mart are expanding their pharmacy businesses. Competition is especially tough in the pharmacy segment, as other retail businesses continue to add pharmacy departments and low-cost pharmacy options become available. Discount retailers have made substantial inroads in gaining market share.Poor Macroeconomic Condition: Although prescriptions and related health care service providers like CVS stay out of general macro-economic turmoil, the recent debt crisis and sluggish economic conditions in the United States could impact consumer purchasing power. This may also influence preferences and spending patterns and result in low prescription utilization.Estimate TrendsIn the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its fiscal 2023 earnings has been down 2.7% of $8.61.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $348.4 billion, suggesting an 8% rise from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

The launch, expected to unify the company’s private brand portfolio, will consolidate Health Mart and Sunmark branded OTC products.The latest launch of the private brand is expected to significantly strengthen McKesson’s Pharmacy &amp; Healthcare Solutions business.Significance of the LaunchPer Consumer Healthcare Products Association’s estimates, the majority of customers use OTC medicines to address their symptoms for various illnesses. Additionally, consumers increasingly turn to private-label OTC products to manage their health, driven by factors like price and recognizing that quality is equivalent to national brands.The consolidation of Health Mart and Sunmark branded OTC products will offer expanded availability via increased production volumes and efficiencies that will likely help meet evolving patient needs and growing demand.Per management, Foster &amp; Thrive is expected to offer pharmacists and their customers selectively sourced products that meet expected quality standards. Management also believes that customers can easily find the products they need and work.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Research and Markets, the global OTC consumer health products market was estimated to be $179.6 billion in 2021 and is anticipated to reach $231.7 billion in 2027 at a CAGR of 4%. Factors like rising awareness of lifestyle diseases and increasing disposable income of the consumers are expected to drive the market.Given the market potential, the recent launch is expected to boost McKesson’s position in the OTC space.Notable DevelopmentsLast month, McKesson announced its fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein it registered a solid uptick in its top and bottom lines. Revenues in its U.S. Pharmaceutical segment were also strong in the quarter, driven by an increased volume of specialty products, including higher volumes from retail national account customers and market growth.Story continuesIn April, McKesson announced that its independent specialty pharmacy specializing in oncology and rare disease areas, Biologics by McKesson, was selected by Reata Pharmaceuticals as the sole specialty pharmacy provider for SKYCLARYS (omaveloxolone).Price PerformanceShares of the company have gained 27.5% in the past year compared with the industry’s 18.9% growth and the S&amp;P 500's 13.3% rise. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCurrently, McKesson carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

The optimism led by a solid first-quarter 2023 performance and its slew of regulatory approvals are expected to contribute further. However, concerns regarding overdependence on Masimo SET and stiff competition persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has gained 18.7% compared with the industry’s 10.8% rise and the S&amp;P 500's 13.3% growth.The renowned global provider of non-invasive monitoring systems has a market capitalization of $8.59 billion. The company projects 3.7% growth for 2023 and expects to maintain its strong performance. Masimo has delivered an earnings surprise of 9.9% for the past four quarters, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Product Suite: We are upbeat about Masimo’s product pipeline. This month, the company announced that it is expanding its premium Denon brand to introduce its latest offering, Masimo AAT (Adaptive Acoustic Technology). The products offered are Denon PerL and PerL Pro True Wireless Earbuds featuring Masimo AAT.In May, it announced the global expansion of the HEOS platform, an iconic brand within its non-healthcare premium and luxury consumer audio business. The expansion enables an always-on connection to the Masimo Health secure cloud for 4 million devices.Regulatory Approvals: Masimo has been receiving regulatory approvals for its products over the past few months, raising our optimism. This month, the company announced that its patient-worn, continuous multi-parameter vital signs monitor, Radius VSM, had received the FDA’s 510(k) clearance.In April, Masimo announced the receipt of the FDA’s 510(k) clearance for its Rad-G with Temperature.Strong Q1 Results: Masimo’s solid first-quarter 2023 results buoy our optimism. The company recorded a robust uptick in the top line, its healthcare business and order shipments in the reported period. The expansion of the company’s installed base was also seen. On the first-quarter earnings call in May, Masimo’s management confirmed having new customers in its pulse oximetry business, and witnessed increasing traction for rainbow and advanced parameter products, which strengthened the healthcare revenues in the quarter.Story continuesDownsidesOverdependence on Masimo SET: Masimo currently derives the majority of its revenues from its primary product offerings like the Masimo SET platform, Masimo rainbow SET platform and related products. Thus, the company’s business is highly dependent on the continued success and market acceptance of its primary product offerings.Stiff Competition: Masimo operates in an intensely competitive medical device industry and is significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants. The Masimo SET platform faces additional competition from companies developing products for use with third-party monitoring systems and from companies currently marketing their pulse oximetry monitors.Estimate TrendMasimo has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings per share has moved north by a penny to $4.76.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s second-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $550.9 million, suggesting a 2.6% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

However, escalating fuel expenses are a concern.Factors Favoring NSCDespite COVID-19-related woes, Norfolk Southern is committed to rewarding its shareholders. In 2021, the company rewarded its shareholders to the tune of $4,418 million, through dividends ($1,028 million) and share buybacks (3,390 million). During 2022, Norfolk Southern paid dividends worth $1,167 million, up 13.5% year over year. It repurchased and retired common stock worth $3,110 million in 2022. In January 2023, NSC's board announced a 9% increase in its quarterly dividend payout. This marked the fourth dividend hike announced by the company in a year. In the first three months of 2023, NSC paid out dividends worth $307 million and repurchased shares worth $163 million. NSC's strong free cash flow generating ability supports its shareholder-friendly activities. In 2022, free cash flow was $2,274 million. In the first three months of 2023, free cash flow increased to $745 million from $605 million a year ago.In first-quarter 2023, railway operating revenues increased 7.5% year over year to $3,132 million. Key segments like Merchandise and Coal registered improvements in revenues. Total revenue per unit rose 8% year over year, driven by higher fuel surcharges and pricing. Income from railway operations climbed 1% year over year to $1,098 million. Such impressive top-line performance, despite the challenging backdrop, is indeed commendable.Key RisksAn increase in fuel costs due to an uptick in oil prices is limiting bottom-line growth.  In 2021, expenses on fuel increased 49% year over year to $799 million at Norfolk Southern. Moreover, the oil price has increased substantially following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. At NSC, expenses on fuel surged 82.6% year over year in 2022, leading to an 18.5% rise in operating costs. Fuel costs increased 5% in first-quarter 2023.  High capex is also likely to play spoilsport. Management expects Capex for 2023 to be roughly $2.1 billion.Story continuesZacks Rank NSC currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks for investors interested in the Zacks Transportation sector are Copa Holdings, S.A. CPA and Triton International Limited TRTN.Copa Holdings, which presently flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is aided by improved air-travel demand. We are encouraged by the company’s initiatives to modernize its fleet. CPA's focus on its cargo segment is also impressive. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.For second-quarter and full-year 2023, CPA’s earnings are expected to register 862.5% and 84.14% growth, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.Triton, which currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), is benefiting from its consistent efforts to reward shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.Triton has an impressive liquidity position. TRTN’s current ratio (a measure of liquidity) was 3.97 at the end of first-quarter 2023. A current ratio of more than 1 often indicates that the company will be easily paying off its short-term obligations.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.63%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 7.23%.Heading into today, shares of the world's largest beverage maker had gained 1.59% over the past month, lagging the Consumer Staples sector's gain of 1.79% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 3.08% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Coca-Cola as it approaches its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect Coca-Cola to post earnings of $0.71 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 1.43%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $11.69 billion, up 3.26% from the year-ago period.KO's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $2.61 per share and revenue of $45.02 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +5.24% and +4.7%, respectively.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Coca-Cola. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant. Coca-Cola currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Coca-Cola has a Forward P/E ratio of 23.49 right now. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 23.15, which means Coca-Cola is trading at a premium to the group.Story continuesMeanwhile, KO's PEG ratio is currently 3.47. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. KO's industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.48 as of yesterday's close.The Beverages - Soft drinks industry is part of the Consumer Staples sector.

The deal has been awarded by the U.S. Army.Valued at $712.3 million, the contract is an extension of a five-year contract the company clinched in 2020, with an extendable option for a sixth year. Per the deal, General Dynamics will deliver 300 Stryker DVHA1 combat vehicles to the U.S. Army.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?Nations have increased their defense spending on military equipment and various arsenals to strengthen their defense capabilities. The surge in the demand for defense products is primarily due to rising geopolitical tensions and amplified terrorist threats.Hence, combat vehicles equipped with varied offensive abilities form an integral part of any defense system. Buoyed by their defensive and offensive capabilities, combat vehicles have registered strong growth in demand and are likely to witness huge investments by nations to procure them.In such a scenario, General Dynamics’ Land Systems, the prime contractor of such remarkably efficient and technologically advanced combat vehicles, is likely to continue to witness a strong order inflow from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.Growth ProspectsPer the report from the Markets and Markets firm, the global armored vehicle market is projected to witness a CAGR of 3.1% during the 2022-2027 period. Such abounding growth trends indicate ample growth opportunities for General Dynamics as it enjoys a lucrative position in the production of combat vehicles.A few other defense primes that can reap the benefits of the aforementioned market growth prospects are BAE Systems BAESY, Northrop Grumman NOC and Raytheon Technologies RTX.BAE Systems’ Challenger 2 is heavily armored and highly mobile, designed for use in the direct fire zone. Its primary role is to destroy or neutralize the armor. It also has the ability to engage both hard and soft targets and can operate across a spectrum of high-intensity conflicts, counter insurgencies and peacekeeping roles.Story continuesThe long-term earnings growth rate of BAESY is projected at 13.7%.

The Institute of Supply Management (ISM) reported that manufacturing PMI (purchasing managers’ index) came in at 46.9 in May. Notably, any reading below 50 indicates a contraction in manufacturing activities.This marked the sixth consecutive month of contraction in U.S. manufacturing activities after 30 months of expansion. The sub-indexes for new orders, production and backlog of orders remained below 50. Demand remains weak in the face of a higher interest rate regime adopted by the Fed and concerns about a near-term recession.However, not all manufacturing industries are suffering from demand shortages. The mining and construction industry and the farm equipment industry are doing well, defying the above-mentioned headwinds.Strong Demand for Mining and ConstructionThe intensifying global focus on shifting from fossil fuels to zero emissions will require a large number of commodities, which, in turn, will support demand for mining equipment in the years to come. The U.S. government's plans to increase investment in infrastructure construction, particularly in critical subsectors, such as transportation, water and sewerage, and telecommunications, should support demand in the coming years.The industry participants are investing in digital initiatives like AI, cloud computing, advanced analytics and robotics. Digital transformation aids organizations in boosting productivity and increasing efficiency, reliability and safety, thereby enriching customer satisfaction. With the pressing need to cut carbon emissions, companies worldwide are relying more on autonomous machinery.Solid Demand for Farm EquipmentGrowing demand for food to sustain the farm equipment industry and the need to replace aging equipment should spur demand. Farm size has been on the rise in the United States, which calls for more laborers. Given the escalation in labor costs every year, farmers are resorting to equipment to replace labor. Demand for agricultural equipment will continue to be supported by increased global demand for food, both from population growth and an increasing proportion of the population aspiring for better living standards.Story continuesCustomers are increasingly relying on advanced technology, smart farming solutions and mechanization to run their operations. Thus, industry participants are enhancing investments in launching products equipped with advanced technologies and features to keep up with customers' evolving demands.Initiatives to advance precision agriculture technology is likely to be a game-changer for the industry players, given its productivity-enhancing and sustainability benefits. Demand continues to grow for popular features, which include automatic guide machines in the field and equipment that plants seeds, and applies chemicals and fertilizers with exceptional accuracy.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five industrial products stocks.

The company closed the original design studio in New Orleans, as its lease expires and it no longer aligns with the current prototype. This leaves Floor &amp; Decor with five design studios.

361,99655662-a2ed-3571-871b-8aa8527bccea,PGR,2023-06-28,Why Nvidia's price volatility has one strategist trimming his holdings,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/why-nvidias-price-volatility-one-195439895.html,1687895679,VIDEO,"['PGR', 'NVDA', 'V', 'GOOG', 'GOOGL']","[Financial and tech stocks are climbing on boosted valuations, but whose growth is here to stay? Aptus Capital Advisors Portfolio Manager David Wagner breaks down his top stock picks, including his outlook on tech giants Alphabet and Nvidia after AI trends injected volatility into the space.Video Transcript[MUSIC PLAYING]- Investors piling back into tech stocks today, coming on the heels of yesterday's move to the downside, while our next guest is warning not to be fooled by some of these recent moves, they certainly have been the outperformers so far this year. He's actually pointing to some other areas to focus on for future investments, joining us now, we want to bring in David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors. David, it's great to see you here, so you're coming with some picks that you see an opportunity with for the second half of the year. When it comes to some of the moves that we've seen in tech, you actually like two names outside of tech, let's start with Visa, your first pick, why do you like it? Why are they positioned well?DAVID WAGNER: Yeah, I definitely think it's time more for the average stock to succeed and more some of what they're calling the Magnificent Seven, maybe, just to take a little bit of break. But simply put, Seana, you know, I believe that the combination of double-digit revenue growth with mid-team EPS growth and the stock trading at a historical discount on its multiple, well, that's going to check a lot of boxes for me here in this market, all though I do think that investors have been a little bit confused around Visa's recent stock performance, I think that really stems from the expectations that volumes are going to decline into the future. I mean, if you look at the Bank of America data coming out in May and April, it did point to some weakness on consumer spending, well, at least, decelerated right now, so, yeah, dollar volumes are definitely making people think that, you know, Visa may not be a really exciting place to be right now. I mean, yes, it's already an overcrowded name, but I think that a lot of these problems are definitely getting discounted in the valuation right now, the stock trades at only-- only a 30% premium to the S&amp;P 500 when it tends to trade at a 50% premium right now. So in all told, I do think that the company's ability to protect on the bottom line in a variety of macro-scenarios, alongside a reasonable valuation, is definitely a reason to remain invested in this name or add to a position.Story continues- Let's talk about the names you're trying to avoid because there's lots of parts through. These have been real favorites here, at least in the first half of the year. Two stocks you say you want to avoid are big tech, Google, let's start with that one because they've recently received two downgrades, the latest one coming from Bernstein, it's interesting to see these notes coming out, talking about the concerns about AI on their search ad business, not necessarily their ability to compete on the technology of AI, how do you view that?DAVID WAGNER: Yeah, it's probably more of a tepid check here for me because I'm probably going to sound a little bullish on Google here right now because it's a wonderful stock to really own for the long-term, if I had some type of portfolio where it was more of a set it and forget it, you know, over the next three to five years, I would happily own Google in it. But I do think, in the near-term, that there's going to be some short-term headwinds here, especially after the recent price movement, I mean, most of all, I do think the stock looks fairly value-- fairly valued as the narrative here has definitely caught up with the fundamentals. But yeah, that's definitely has allowed this company to, you know, be up 40% since its market bottomed back in November, but it does appear, as you just mentioned, that, you know, Google Search market position is definitely under increasing threat from Microsoft.And then you have a potential, you know, for some type of financial problems from integrating Baird into Google Search, basically, you know, the company's risking us creating some near-term air pockets on the revenue side by cannibalizing some, you know, prime real estate for their generative AI results, which is definitely going to take away ad space from its buyers. But you know, I think it's kind of, probably, dangerous, you know, there is some danger-- I guess, it's probably the better way of saying it-- in moving to the sidelines on a name like Google because it screens really well, I mean, the company has a ton of cash, it's trading, you know, like, 20 times forward expectations, and the company still could see, definitely, a pathway to a 12% revenue growth, KGA, actually, over the next few years. But really, from my seat, I think that the risk associated with this competition in search and then some potential margin misses definitely outweighs the potential upside, actually, from just some topline beats here.- David, another name that you're seeming to avoid, Nvidia, that's, like, up 185% since the start of the year, why is this as good as it gets? At least for now?DAVID WAGNER: Yeah, I-- I probably trimmed this a little too early, but I'm actually still in this name, I love the name, you know, long-term, but I'm probably going to continue to collect some gains here. And I'm not going to-- I'm going to mention, it's not solely because of that massive move you just mentioned there, Seana, but really, more, it's just the injection in a portfolio from a price-volatility standpoint, you know, given that the stock is probably very highly valued in the eyes of many people. I mean, we all know that this is really just more of a narrative type of stock right now, and in the AI space, there's going to be winners, and there's going to be losers because, you know, it's a potentially very, very large market, so we know that there's probably going to be wild prices in valuations, some wild pricing just at the individual stock level.And that's probably what you're going to get here in the video, especially, as I mentioned, with its valuation, but I think it's also important for investors, really, to understand the bull case here, and that's definitely around [INAUDIBLE] because I do think that GPU will continue to drive positive earnings revisions into the future because, what we've learned from past cycles is that, data center cycles, they don't just last one year, so that last earnings report on their Q2 guidance, probably, isn't one-time in nature. But the biggest reason, as I mentioned before there, Seana, that I'm on the sidelines is that, there's probably going to be some air pockets in this price because that's a risk of buying a name at this valuation of what they're trading at right now. If there is an air pocket on some type of earnings guidance, which is probably inevitable at some type of point, you know, you could see the stock going back 20%, but like I mentioned before, I-- I own the name, I've trimmed the name, but that's really because I don't want to subject a lot of my investors to all that price volatility within a portfolio.- David, is that something that's specific to Nvidia, though, because we've seen a lot of choppiness in Nvidia's competitors as well, especially given the enthusiasm around AI? Is it specifically the concern around these air pockets that you talked about with NVIDIA? Or can you sort of put that thesis to some other names like an AMD and other chip makers?DAVID WAGNER: Yeah, I think that's a comment that-- a blanket comment that can be tossed across a multitude of names, look at Marvell, look at AMD, you know, look at AVGO. And if I were to play one there, [INAUDIBLE] I probably would be playing more Broadcom right now, which-- which I do own, more so because of the valuation, it's trading closer to 17, 18 times while, you know, Nvidia is trading, actually, at a lower than historical multiple of about 46 times, it's still below, like, an AMD and a Marvel. So I believe that-- you know what, people here, over the last 10 years, have believed that price presages price movements, when in fact, over longer periods of time, price doesn't always presage price movements, it's valuation is one of the best drivers to presage future outperformance.- All right, David, before we let you go, let's get to your last pick that you actually like right now, you think it's positioned well in the insurance family progressive, what is the edge that you see in Progressive against some of its competitors?DAVID WAGNER: Yeah, Seana, I really, really like Progressive right now, probably a little too much, to be quite honest, but I believe that their positioning and profitability of Progressive really makes it a category killer, I mean, the company benefits from size, it benefits from scale, I mean, just look at the long-standing track record of its superior underwriting prowess, and then, you also have a company that's experienced its fastest growth in about 21 years, which is aided by its dominant brand name and, you know, its multiple distribution channels. I think that the misunderstood part here-- why it's only trading at 17 times-- is that, auto insurance pricing works on a two-year lag, you know, go back two, three years, you had a substantial increase in used car pricings since COVID, but you had these higher loss ratios because these companies weren't compensated from an increase of premiums just yet because they had that two-year lag. But now, we're starting to see, actually, the exact opposite, you're starting to see used car pricing come down and appear to where actually auto insurers are getting some type of tailwinds from rate increases, just look what's going on in California, in that case, but you know, that's really increasing the revenue, and that's increasing profitability, with a healthier combined ratio. I think the knock on PGR is probably the exact knock you're going to give on NVIDIA, it's going to be valuation, but I think, here, in this case, investors are miscategorizing the name because, yes, it's an insurer, it's a financial, but I don't see it as a financial at all, I actually see it as more of a consumer staple, in my opinion. And if you look at it versus consumer staple peers, whether you're going to throw out a Colgate, a P&amp;G, a Pepsi, it actually trades closer to the lower end of its range-- of its two-year range, actually, by 2 standard deviations, so I would actually say this is more of a relative value here, especially if you're looking to become more defensive in your portfolio positioning without giving up some type of earnings power.- And it certainly hasn't seen much move since the start of the year, up just over 1%, we'll see if the second half is better than the first. All right, David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors, thanks so much.]"
362,976cc611-5ddb-351b-91ce-df5b257586b8,VLO,2023-06-28,Valero Energy Corporation (VLO) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/valero-energy-corporation-vlo-trending-130013286.html,1687870813,STORY,['VLO'],"[Valero Energy (VLO) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this oil refiner have returned -0.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, which Valero Energy falls in, has gained 1.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Valero Energy is expected to post earnings of $5.43 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -52.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.8%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $22.20 points to a change of -23.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -2.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $14.16 indicates a change of -36.2% from what Valero Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -4.7%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Valero Energy.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Valero Energy, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $35.58 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -31.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $143.07 billion and $136.47 billion estimates indicate -18.9% and -4.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryValero Energy reported revenues of $36.44 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -5.5%. EPS of $8.27 for the same period compares with $2.31 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $28.89 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +26.14%. The EPS surprise was +14.23%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Valero Energy is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Valero Energy. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's 1.15% gain on the day. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.63%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 7.23%.Heading into today, shares of the largest U.S. health insurer had lost 0.51% over the past month, lagging the Medical sector's gain of 2.4% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 3.08% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from UnitedHealth Group as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be July 14, 2023. On that day, UnitedHealth Group is projected to report earnings of $6.04 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 8.44%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $90.59 billion, up 12.77% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $24.86 per share and revenue of $364.93 billion, which would represent changes of +12.03% and +12.58%, respectively, from the prior year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for UnitedHealth Group should also be noted by investors. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently.

364,e047a1ae-4a9f-3e12-b325-96349b75011d,UNH,2023-06-28,UnitedHealth Group (UNH) Expands Home Healthcare Business,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unitedhealth-group-unh-expands-home-164500607.html,1687884300,STORY,"['UNH', 'AMED']","[UnitedHealth Group UNH announced its acquisition of Amedisys Inc. AMED for a whopping $3.3 billion or $101 per share in a significant move to strengthen its position in the home healthcare sector. This all-cash deal will allow UnitedHealth to expand its home healthcare business, providing enhanced care services to a wider range of patients.Benefiting UnitedHealth's Home Healthcare BusinessAmedisys is a prominent home health and hospice caregiver in the healthcare industry. With this acquisition, UnitedHealth Group aims to capitalize on the evolving landscape of the home health sector. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of accessible and comprehensive healthcare services in the comfort of one's home. As people increasingly prefer receiving medical care outside of traditional hospital settings, home healthcare has gained tremendous momentum.The Amedisys buyout positions UnitedHealth as a key player in meeting the growing demand for home-based healthcare services. By integrating Amedisys with its subsidiary Optum, UnitedHealth will be able to offer a broader range of home health and hospice caregiving solutions. This strategic move will enable UnitedHealth to provide high-quality, patient-centric care, improve outcomes and enhance the overall patient experience.Evolving Home Health Sector Post-PandemicThe home health sector has witnessed a significant transformation in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, prompting a surge in demand for home-based care services.UnitedHealth's acquisition of Amedisys aligns perfectly with this changing landscape. UNH can leverage its expertise, resources and technological advancements to deliver innovative care solutions and thus ramp up growth in its home healthcare business.Strategic Acquisitions a Pillar of UnitedHealth's Growth StrategyThe acquisition of Amedisys marks yet another successful strategic move by UnitedHealth Group. The healthcare provider has a proven track record of leveraging acquisitions to enhance its position in the healthcare industry. Earlier this year, UNH acquired LHC Group, a direct competitor of Amedisys, for $5.4 billion. This acquisition allowed UnitedHealth to expand its home healthcare footprint and establish itself as a leader in the space.By strategically identifying and integrating complementary businesses, UnitedHealth has consistently demonstrated its commitment to innovation and delivering comprehensive healthcare solutions. These acquisitions enable the company to tap into new markets, leverage synergies and enhance its ability to provide exceptional care to millions of individuals across the country.Story continuesThe Other Side of the CoinIt is worth noting that Amedisys had previously entered into a merger agreement with Option Care Health Inc. However, in light of the UnitedHealth acquisition, Amedisys has decided to terminate the deal with Option Care Health. The termination of the agreement will incur a termination fee of $106 million, which will be paid by Amedisys to Option Care.This strategic shift emphasizes Amedisys' confidence in the prospects of joining forces with UnitedHealth Group. By aligning with a healthcare powerhouse like UnitedHealth, Amedisys can leverage the extensive resources, expertise and market reach of Optum to further enhance its services and drive growth in the home healthcare sector.Zacks Rank and Price PerformanceUnitedHealth Group carries a Zacks #3 (Hold) currently.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this largest U.S. health insurer have returned -0.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - HMOs industry, which UnitedHealth falls in, has lost 0.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.UnitedHealth is expected to post earnings of $6.04 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $24.86 points to a change of +12% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.4%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $27.84 indicates a change of +12% from what UnitedHealth is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.7%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for UnitedHealth.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For UnitedHealth, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $90.59 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +12.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $364.93 billion and $388.37 billion estimates indicate +12.6% and +6.4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUnitedHealth reported revenues of $91.93 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.7%. EPS of $6.26 for the same period compares with $5.49 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $89.33 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.92%. The EPS surprise was +0.32%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.UnitedHealth is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about UnitedHealth. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

""The findings from the June Index highlight a shift in the overall happiness of Canadian workers across regions and demographics, which is particularly interesting when considering the widespread increases we saw last month,"" says Heather Haslam, Vice President of Marketing, ADP Canada. ""The downward trajectory this month may be a reflection of the transition to summer and potentially indicate that Canadian workers are ready to take some time off to recharge.

This led to robust first-quarter 2023 results, wherein the bottom and top lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved year over year.The company’s adjusted earnings of 54 cents per share surged 86.2% year over year. Net sales grew 5.9% to $2,346.3 million. On a constant-currency basis, net sales rose 8.2%, driven by favorable price and sales mix, offset by a slight decline in financial volume.Net sales per hectoliter increased 6.1% on a reported basis and 8.4% on a constant-currency basis, driven by strong net pricing and a favorable sales mix stemming from premiumization.Additionally, an uptrend in the Zacks Consensus Estimate echoes the same sentiment. Earnings estimates for GPS’s current financial year have increased 4.6% to $4.54 over the past 30 days.Let’s Delve DeeperMolson Coors is on track with its revitalization plan focused on achieving sustainable top-line growth by streamlining the organization and reinvesting resources into its brands and capabilities. The company intends to invest in iconic brands and growth opportunities in the above-premium beer space; expand in adjacencies and beyond beer; and create digital competencies for commercial functions, supply-chain-related system capabilities and employees.To facilitate these investments, TAP plans to generate savings of $150 million by simplifying its structure. The company is also building on the strength of its iconic core brands. Additionally, its cost-saving program, announced in 2020, targets delivering cost savings of $600 million over three years.Strength in Coors Light, Miller Lite and Coors Banquet resulted in total industry share growth in the United States, driven by brand positionings and better marketing. Molson Canadian and Carling beer in the U.K., and national champion brands witnessed significant market share gains.The company remains committed to growing its market share through innovation and premiumization. With a view to accelerating portfolio premiumization, it has been aggressively growing its above-premium portfolio in the past few years. The company highlighted that it is making efforts to change the shape of its product portfolio and expand in growth areas.Its U.S. above-premium portfolio witnessed sales that outpaced its U.S. economy portfolio, driven by rapid growth of its hard seltzers, the successful launch of Simply Spiked Lemonade, and the continued strength in Blue Moon and Peroni’s.Story continuesDriven by these factors, 2023 sales are projected to grow year over year in the low-single digits on a constant-currency basis, in line with our estimate of 1.5% growth. Underlying EBT is likely to grow year over year in the low-single digits on a constant-currency basis.Consequently, shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have gained 27.8% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 0.1%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research However, Molson Coors’ worldwide first-quarter brand volumes fell 2.1% to 16.2 million due to sluggishness in America, as well as EMEA&amp;APAC. Financial volumes declined 0.2% to 17 million hectoliters due to lower volumes in the Americas, partly offset by increased EMEA&amp;APAC volumes.Cost inflation related to materials, conversion and energy costs, and mix impacts of portfolio premiumization led to a rise in COGS per hectoliter of 22.7% on a reported basis and 7.4% in constant currency. Also, it has been witnessing weakened consumer demand across the beer industry due to pricing actions. Management expects global inflationary pressures to create a headwind.ConclusionWe believe that brand strength, product innovation, pricing actions, the premiumization of its global portfolio, and the revitalization plan will offset cost woes and drive growth further for Molson Coors. Topping it, long-term growth of 4.3% and a Value Score of B raise optimism in the stock.Other Stocks to ConsiderWe highlighted some other top-ranked stocks from the broader Consumer Staples space, namely Procter &amp; Gamble PG, Nomad Foods NOMD and Celsius Holdings CELH.Nomad Foods, currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), manufactures and distributes frozen foods.

Major stock indexes suffered a huge blow last year. However, the Dow suffered the least.In 2022, the Dow fell 8.8% year over year, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite plummeted 19.4% and 33.1%, respectively. Last year, the Fed raised the benchmark interest rate by 4.25% to combat 40-year high inflation.A higher interest rate is detrimental to growth stocks like consumer discretionary and technology. In contrast to the Nasdaq Composite and the S&amp;P 500 indexes, the 30-stock Dow is more inclined to cyclical stocks than growth stocks. Therefore, the index suffered the least. However, the situation has taken a turn in 2023.Dow Changes Course in 2023Several economic data have pointed out that the U.S. economy has been cooling since the beginning of 2023. The inflation rate has dropped to a good extent despite remaining elevated in absolute terms.Consequently, the Fed reduced the magnitude of interest rate hike in 2023. In the June FOMC meeting, the Fed paused the rate hike for the first time after 10 consecutive increases. However, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell warned that more rate raises are expected by the end of this year.A lower rate hike has enabled growth sector like technology, communication services and consumer discretionary to thrive this year. Consequently, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has jumped 28.9% year to date. The broad-market S&amp;P 500 Index has also seen a decent rally of 13.3%.

But they also warned of ""likely limited cash infusion from the deal for SLG"" and cited ""the heavily leveraged capital structure of the building.""SL Green's stock jumped 11% on Tuesday to a high of $31.35 per share. Through the market close on Friday, the company's stock had lost about half its value over the past one year and roughly 70% since the beginning of 2022.245 Park Avenue is a high-end ""Class A"" property located in mid-town Manhattan near the Grand Central Terminal, housing several financial firms including Ares Management, Angelo Gordon, and Societe Generale.The stake sale represents a slight discount to the $2.21 billion China's HNA Group paid to acquire the building in 2017 when New York City's commercial real estate market was at its peak.

Additionally, short-term traders find this SMA very beneficial, as it smooths out short-term price trends and shows more trend reversal signals than longer-term moving averages.Like other SMAs, if a stock's price is moving above the 20-day, the trend is considered positive.

This move can be attributable to notable volume with a higher number of shares being traded than in a typical session. This compares to the stock's 7.1% gain over the past four weeks.This increased investor optimism can be attributed to SL Green’s announcement of the divestment of a 49.9% interest in 245 Park Avenue. The stake was purchased by a U.S. affiliate of Mori Trust Co., Ltd., and the transaction valued the asset at $2 billion. This sale is a pivotal component of SL Green's 2023 financial strategy, coming on the heels of a successful $500 million refinancing of 919 Third Avenue earlier in April.This commercial real estate investment trust is expected to post quarterly funds from operations (FFO) of $1.33 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -28.9%. Revenues are expected to be $165.55 million, up 21.3% from the year-ago quarter.While FFO per share and revenue growth expectations are important in evaluating the potential strength in a stock, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in FFO per share estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For SL Green, the consensus FFO per share estimate for the quarter has been revised 1% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. And a negative trend in FFO per share estimate revisions doesn't usually translate into price appreciation. So, make sure to keep an eye on SLG going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road.The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

SLG, New York City's foremost office landlord, announced the divestment of a 49.9% interest in 245 Park Avenue. The stake was purchased by a U.S. affiliate of Mori Trust Co., Ltd., and the transaction valued the asset at $2.0 billion.This sale is a pivotal component of SL Green's 2023 financial strategy, coming on the heels of a successful $500 million refinancing of 919 Third Avenue earlier in April. Reflecting positive sentiments, SLG shares were up more than 19% during Monday’s regular trading session.Harrison Sitomer, chief investment officer of SL Green, expressed his excitement about the partnership with Mori Trust, a premier development and investment company based in Tokyo. According to Sitomer, this collaboration attests to the continuing allure of investing in trophy midtown NY assets and the resilience of the Park Avenue corridor as New York’s most desirable office market.SL Green took ownership of this 1.8 million-square-foot office property located on the renowned Park Avenue corridor between 46th and 47th Streets in September 2022. The company's vision was to collaboratively reposition this asset, which involved a comprehensive redesign plan.On the leasing front, SL Green has shown impressive performance. According to an announcement made earlier in June, since the beginning of the second quarter and through Jun 5, the company signed 31 office leases covering around 300,000 square feet. This lifted SL Green's office leasing volume from the beginning of the year through that date to more than 800,000 square feet, with an office leasing pipeline exceeding one million square feet.This series of events, including the stake sale and the impressive leasing performance, underlines SL Green's strength as New York City's top office landlord. These developments also underscore the resilience of the NYC commercial real estate market and SL Green's strategic position within it.Despite the sale of a 49.9% interest in 245 Park Avenue, SL Green maintains a robust presence in the New York City commercial real estate market, particularly through its other assets and the leasing successes. The strategic sale of the stake to Mori Trust affiliate not only provides substantial liquidity to SL Green but also reaffirms the appeal of the NYC real estate market to global investors.Furthermore, the robust leasing activity across SL Green's portfolio signifies a positive trend for the company. The continued leasing success reflects the attractiveness of SL Green's properties, which are conveniently located, well-amenitized, and managed by a well-capitalized operator.While challenges persist in the office market environment, SL Green's latest developments showcase its ability to navigate these hurdles and underline its strength as New York City's top office landlord. As the company continues to leverage its strategic position, investors can anticipate seeing more growth and success from SL Green in the future.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have outperformed the industry it belongs to in the past three months.

That’s difficult to predict as the U.S. economy continues to confound even the best economic minds. That’s not to say there aren’t high-risk bubble stocks to sell. There are. In fact, despite positive signs, bubbles continue to exist everywhere. Macroeconomic factors suggest the U.S. economy is not healthy overall. U.S. debt remains sky-high at the government level. The deficit is growing and recent theatrics in Congress haven’t changed anything for the better. In addition, bubbles extend to credit card debt, car loan debt, student loan debt, the housing market, the commercial real estate market, and tech stocks that have propped up a surging stock market. A severe recession remains entirely possible. Whether that occurs or not it makes sense to drop riskier stocks currently. High-Risk Bubble Stocks: Wells Fargo (WFC)Figurines of two little men in suits looking at downward stock arrow going through the floorSource: shutterstock.com/Black SalmonInvestors should seriously consider dropping Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). Trust in banks has taken a hit in 2023. Among big banks, only JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) has been spared in 2023. That’s largely due to its size and the leading role it played when regional banks collapsed months earlier. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe point here is that Wells Fargo was already suffering a lack of trust prior to the most recent meltdown. The company already got caught for creating fake accounts in order to make its operations appear stronger than they were. It’s a wild and concerning thing to do for any bank, especially one of the largest in the U.S. The bank was trying to put that scandal behind it. It clearly did a poor job as it recently was fined $1 billion for overstating its progress in cleaning up that scandal. I believe it’s fair to state that Wells Fargo is not a trustworthy bank at this point. Given that you shouldn’t inherently trust banks overall, that’s probably saying something. Again, consider Wells Fargo a high-risk bubble stock to sell now.Story continuesHigh-Risk Bubble Stocks: Regions Financial (RF)Grayish photo of investor's hands hovering over laptop with red stock graph showing downward arrow overlayed on top of the imageSource: shutterstock.com/Leonid SorokinRegions Financial (NYSE:RF) is a regional bank and stock that offers a catch-22 in terms of investing. It’s also another high-risk bubble stock to sell. The company appears to be doing well based on its first-quarter results. Earnings are up, revenues increased by 22%, and it seems to be heading toward a better place. That’s the magic of increased interest rates that increase net interest income. Regions Financial serves the southeast, deep south, and midwest. But it is most concentrated across Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and Florida. Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia all happen to be among the states that struggle the most with credit card debt. So, with credit card debt above $1 trillion and a clear bubble at hand, Regions Financial is at risk. Commercial real estate and mortgage loans make up roughly one-third of its outstanding loans. Those are bubbles of their own. The overall picture for RF stock is a high-risk bank exposed to serious bubbles that continue to brew.  High-Risk Bubble Stocks: SoFi Technologies (SOFI)little girl holding a stock chart with athumbs down. stocks to avoidSource: ShutterstockThe clearest reason to sell SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI) stock today is simply that it has gotten too hot, too quickly. The stock was one of the big winners to emerge from the debt ceiling deal. That deal set a clear date for the resumption of federal student loan payments. SoFi Technologies, which holds significant student loans, is a clear beneficiary of the deal then. Share prices basically doubled due to the discussions and deal. So, investors should sell it in order to simply capture their profit. But that’s not really why I’m bearish on SOFI stock. Instead, I believe that SoFi Technologies now suffers from the real risk that the restart of repayments won’t be as strong as analysts believe. There’s a very real risk that strained student loan holders will default in record numbers in the coming months. They were already defaulting at record rates prior to the pause. They have less money now than they did then so it only makes sense that things are going t get worse. Vornado Realty Trust (VNO)a frustrated man with a white board behind him that features a black downward arrowSource: ShutterstockI’ve written about Vornado Realty Trust (NYSE:VNO) as a stock to avoid several times recently. I continue to believe it should be avoided today. The commercial real estate firm is heavily concentrated across office spaces in New York, Chicago, and San Francisco. It should be high on any list of commercial real estate bubble stocks. Vornado Realty Trust has postponed dividend payments until the end of 2023. REIT stocks use high-yield dividends to lure investors. When they pay things are great. It was paying a very high 11%. That income now no longer exists. In the first quarter, Vornado’s net income was five-fold. San Francisco has recently been in the headlines as hotels close after failing to make payments. Cracks are emerging in the commercial real estate sector. Vornado’s markets also suffer from being in geographies in which workers have much more sway. Return-to-office mandates aren’t going to go over well in San Francisco, New York, and Chicago. It all spells continued trouble and bigger losses. Nvidia (NVDA)earningsSource: ShutterstockIf there is a single tech stock at the most risk, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has to be it. The emergence of AI has catalyzed a recent surge across the tech industry. That surge has been powerful enough to raise markets overall, accounting for a great percentage of overall market gains of late. Nvidia’s chips have emerged to be a keystone to the generative AI progress that promises to rapidly increase productivity and revenues along with it. The firm’s huge Q1 earnings release and second-quarter guidance took it from a potential AI champion to the clear winner. Concerns of an AI bubble cropped up as soon as earnings were released. They died down and NVDA shares jumped higher again. I’m not saying investors should dump Nvidia now. I have no way to accurately say it’s going to cool off. Honestly, I thought it would stay at $390 but I was wrong. It’s now at $430. Yet, more and more bears are emerging drawing comparisons between AI and the Dot com bubble. It’s almost moot to say take profits now. I’m sure most readers will have done that if they’ve been lucky enough to buy it months ago. Yet, it’s fair to warn that buying in now is clearly risky. Armour Residential REIT (ARR)a keyboard with a greet enter key marked sell, representing overvalued stocks to sellSource: ShutterstockArmour Residential REIT’s (NYSE:ARR) price chart tells investors a great deal about the stock. Inflation concerns that cropped up in late 2021 and culminated in rate hikes beginning in March of 2022 correlate nicely with its arc. Share prices have more than halved since then. Funnily enough, the company was arguably doing worse prior to Fed rate hikes. Its net loss in the first quarter of 2022 totaled $66.43 million. It narrowed to $34.35 million in the first quarter of this year. That was mostly on account of securities trading discrepancies during those two respective periods. Net interest income dropped by a factor of three. That means interest rate increases are hurting the firm.  What’s particularly troublesome is that the company almost brags about raising $181 million in capital by issuing 30 million new shares in the first quarter. There are only 190 million in total. That should be dilutive. The dividend yielding 18.4% is a siren song that investors should avoid. Vornado Realty Trust, just above, should tell investors all they need to know in that regard. UBS Group (UBS)sell written on a chalkboard representing overvalued stocks to sellSource: ShutterstockUBS Group (NYSE:UBS) emerged as a winner as U.S. regional bank meltdown contagion spread to Europe and claimed Credit Suisse. UBS was forced to save Credit Suisse by regulators. It initially bristled at the prospect of doing so but the result is that there is no one single European money manager for the global elite. The forced merger will result in tens of thousands of jobs lost as UBS sheds Credit Suisse employees in the aftermath. As sympathetic as I am to them, that’s no reason to suggest it’s time to sell UBS. Frankly, it should benefit share prices due to the implied increase in efficiency. The reason is that it isn’t a well-run bank despite its association with the global elite and a previously untouchable Swiss banking sector. Multiple financial metrics indicate real distress. In particular, UBS’ equity-to-asset ratio is very weak. The lower the ratio, the more likely a bank is to be reliant on debt financing. UBS’ ratio is worse than 9 out of 10 banks. Further, it simply doesn’t create value as revealed by a return on investment of 0%.  On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Horton's (NYSE:DHI) Impressive Returns On Capital,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-shouldnt-overlook-d-r-110021442.html,1687950021,STORY,['DHI'],"[If we want to find a stock that could multiply over the long term, what are the underlying trends we should look for? One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in D.R. Horton's (NYSE:DHI) returns on capital, so let's have a look.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for D.R. Horton:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.27 = US$6.8b ÷ (US$31b - US$5.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Therefore, D.R. Horton has an ROCE of 27%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 17% earned by companies in a similar industry. Check out our latest analysis for D.R. Horton roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for D.R. Horton compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.The Trend Of ROCED.R. Horton is displaying some positive trends. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 27%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 119%. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.The Key TakeawayAll in all, it's terrific to see that D.R. Horton is reaping the rewards from prior investments and is growing its capital base. And a remarkable 217% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if D.R.

382,8ad8e6f7-9058-4747-9ef3-c41ef48a4a80,DHI,2023-06-28,Homebuilder rally shows it's not just a 'Big Tech' market — a good sign for the economy,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/homebuilder-rally-shows-its-not-just-a-big-tech-market--a-good-sign-for-the-economy-200450354.html,1687896290,STORY,"['DHI', 'LEN', 'LEN-B', 'PHM']","[Homebuilder stocks have been on a tear — and rightly so, according to one analyst — which could be a good omen for the economy.""More than anything, the rally in homebuilders shows the 2023 US equity rally is not just about Big Tech. Other pockets of the market are working as well,"" Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.The SPDR S&amp;P Homebuilder ETF (XHB), which focuses on the US homebuilding industry, rose as much as 28.2% for the year, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 Index's 12.7% gain, according to a research note from DataTrek. It also closed at a new 52-week high on Tuesday.""Can a US recession really be just around the corner if homebuilding stocks just made a new high today?"" he asked. ""The short answer to the query posed above is 'no, obviously not.'""The file photo, workers construct new Pulte homes in Mesa, Ariz. PulteGroup, Inc. (AP Photo/Matt York, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Additionally, Colas noted, homebuilding stocks ""remain cheap to the market.""For instance, the average valuation of the fund's top 10 holdings based on forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate is 14.6x, compared with the S&amp;P 500 at 18.6x, Colas noted. That includes such homebuilders as PulteGroup (PHM) at 8.6x, Lennar (LEN) at 9.9x, D.R. Horton (DHI) at 12.2x, and NVR (NVR) at 15.6x.One big reason for the optimism for homebuilders — and among them — is the limited housing supply, Colas wrote, especially in the resale market. Homeowners have been reluctant to sell their homes and swap their low rates on their current mortgages for ones that are twice as high.As a result, buyers frustrated by the lack of choices among previously-owned homes are flocking to the new home market. In May, new home sales jumped 12.2% to a seasonally adjusted rate of 763,000 units from April, the government reported Tuesday. That was also up 20% from a year ago.Builders have responded by accelerating their development plans. In May, a strong housing starts print showed new construction of both single and multi-family units jumped 21.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.631 million units.Story continuesCitigroup analysts led by Anthony Pettinari wrote in a note to clients on Monday that current shortages in housing “may provide a multi-year tailwind for builders.”Builders foreshadowed this swing in fortunes in their latest earnings calls where they credited steady demand, tight resale inventory, and cooling price inflation on building materials for beating expectations and rosier outlooks.Colas echoed all these advantages in his note, along with the slowing of interest-rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.“And, if the Fed really is near the end of their current tightening cycle, then interest rates should decline in 2024 and beyond and support demand over the longer term,” Colas wrote.—Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

These, however, may not be enough. Sometimes, a stock gets a boost if these numbers climb year over year or surpass estimates in a particular quarter, thus offering a great opportunity for an investor with a shorter horizon to cash in on. But if you seek long-term returns, investments backed only by sales and earnings numbers may not yield the desired results.A critical analysis of a company’s financial background is a prerequisite for an informed investment decision. Here, coverage ratios that determine whether a company is sound enough to meet its financial obligations play a crucial role. The higher the ratio, the better. The focus of this article is on “Interest Coverage,” which is one such ratio.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest &amp; Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?The interest coverage ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt.Debt, which is crucial for most companies to finance operations, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and its creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets interest obligations. Therefore, Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.Interest coverage ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than 1.0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships. Definitely, one should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.Linde plc LIN, Sterling Infrastructure, Inc. STRL, Atmos Energy Corporation ATO and O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. ORLY boast an impressive interest coverage ratio.Story continuesThe Winning StrategyApart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X-Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history.Projected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.VGM Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.Here are four of the nine stocks that qualified the screening:Linde, which operates as an industrial gas company, carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a VGM Score of B.

387,bad01ee4-4947-39f1-98d7-b37d03ca1ed8,AFL,2023-06-28,Too many US adults are skipping wellness appointments that can help save their lives,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/too-many-us-adults-skipping-111300420.html,1687950780,STORY,['AFL'],"[1 in 2 American adults admit to avoiding important health screenings  COLUMBUS, Ga., June 28, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Americans don't seem to be on a path to living healthier, longer lives, according to a study released by Aflac Incorporated, a leading provider of supplemental health insurance in the U.S.1 The Wellness Matters survey, conducted among 2,001 employed adults in the U.S., examines attitudes, habits and opinions about health and preventive care.The nationally representative survey finds that many — 1 in 4 — simply skip regular checkups because they are feeling healthy. Other reasons cited include conflicts with work hours (23%); not thinking about it (22%); dislike of going to the doctor (21%); insurance issues (21%); fear of hearing bad health news (18%); and time commitment to go to the doctor (16%).2According to the survey, about half of adults have avoided at least one common health screening, including tests for certain diseases and other exams. At the same time, 51% of respondents who have had cancer said their diagnosis came as a result of a routine checkup or screening.2Men and women do not see eye to eye on their current and future health.   Survey findings show the majority of men have a positive outlook regarding all aspects of their current health, including their ability to control it in the future: weight/BMI (56% men, 38% women); financial health (53% men, 40% women); mental health (66% men, 56% women); and physical health (69% men, 54% women). Hispanic men and women also have differing outlooks: weight/BMI (64% men, 45% women); financial health (57% men, 44% women); mental health (71% men, 62% women); and physical health (77% men, 63% women).2Generational points of view show wide gap in control over health.According to the survey, Gen Z [ages 18-24] feels the least control over their mental and physical health, yet they are the most likely to skip annual wellness visits that could empower them to feel more in control. Baby boomers [ages 57-65] (64%) and Gen X [ages 41-56] (55%) think preventive care is very important to their overall health and well-being, versus millennials [ages 25-40] (49%) and Gen Z (40%).2 Story continuesManaging health and wellness does not come easy for U.S. Hispanic population.Among Hispanic survey respondents, 31% indicate language is a barrier to accessing preventive care resources. As a result, 72% have avoided a wellness screening, compared to 46% who do not feel it is a barrier. Many Hispanic respondents also agree (61%) that health care providers and organizations need to better engage and educate the Latino community about the benefits of being proactive with their health and wellness.2Screenings work and lead to better outcomes. A significant number (72%) of Hispanic survey respondents diagnosed with cancer found out at a routine medical exam or regularly scheduled annual screening, compared to 46% of the general population.2An analysis of Aflac internal data reveals its cancer wellness benefit claims dropped in 2022 compared to 2019 — notably among younger generations. For every 1,000 Aflac policyholders, cancer policy wellness claims dropped 11% for those in their 20s and 9% for those in their 30s.3""The results of the Wellness Matters survey put a spotlight on the need for individuals to have a more proactive approach to their health care,"" said Tom Morey, chief actuary, Aflac U.S. ""That is why Aflac is encouraging policyholders and others to take control of their health by building good health habits early, asking health and insurance providers questions, and prioritizing routine wellness checkups.""Take wellness matters into your own hands — sooner rather than later. According to the survey, individuals are more likely to schedule checkups and prioritize wellness screenings as adults if their parents or caregivers demonstrated good habits, such as scheduling childhood wellness appointments, early in life. Most individuals are self-motivated to go to the doctor, most notably Baby boomers (64%), followed by Gen X (45%), millennials (35%), and Gen Z (29%). Additionally, encouragement from loved ones and financial incentives can help motivate individuals to seek preventive care. Many (64%) say they benefit from friends and family who encourage them to go to the doctor for routine visits. Most (85%) are more likely to go to a routine checkup appointment if a cash incentive was offered to help with the cost.2Learn more at Aflac.com/WellnessMatters.ABOUT THE STUDY The 2023 Wellness Matters Survey was conducted among a nationally representative sample of 2,001 employed U.S. adults ages 18-65 in June 2023 by Kantar Profiles on behalf of Aflac. As part of the Hispanic population report, 200 Spanish-speaking respondents were added for a total of 580 respondents to ensure a robust understanding of this population.

388,92f258e5-c21f-33f7-b9f9-95d59781cf4d,AFL,2023-06-28,Aflac (AFL) Upgraded to Buy: Here's What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aflac-afl-upgraded-buy-heres-160006953.html,1687881606,STORY,['AFL'],"[Aflac (AFL) appears an attractive pick, as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.A company's changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating. The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years.Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Aflac is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.For Aflac, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for AflacThis insurer is expected to earn $5.81 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2023, which represents a year-over-year change of 9%.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Aflac. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 4%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Aflac to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In case transmission costs go up and the company is unable to recover those from its customers, operational expenses are bound to rise.Fall in the third-party electric transmission system’s performance will adversely impact LNT’s operations and limit its ability to transmit electricity within the service territories.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same industry are NiSource Inc NI, PPL Corporation PPL and OGE Energy Corp.

391,79bd4507-d72f-3923-8502-834815d97523,PEP,2023-06-28,15 Jobs That Still Offer Traditional Pensions,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-jobs-still-offer-traditional-234252798.html,1687909372,STORY,['PEP'],"[In this article, we will look at 15 jobs that still offer traditional pensions while exploring the changing landscape of pensions in the U.S. We will also look at companies and industries which have pensions as a part of their compensation package for their employees. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can head straight to 5 Jobs That Still Offer Traditional Pensions.Retirement is often envisioned as a chapter of life filled with relaxation, fulfillment, and the freedom to pursue passions long put on hold. Yet, retirement plans in the U.S have faced unprecedented challenges. Economic volatility, shifting employment landscapes, and lingering uncertainties have compelled retirees in the United States to reevaluate their post-retirement lives.Where are the golden traditional pensions in the U.S Today?Defined-benefit plans or traditional pensions, once common in the private sector, have largely been replaced by defined-contribution plans like 401(k)s. Only 15% of private-sector workers currently have access to defined-benefit plans. Defined-contribution plans are preferred by companies due to their lower cost and complexity compared to pension plans. This shift has placed the responsibility of saving and investing for retirement on employees.On the other hand, in defined-benefit plans, employers funded the plan, and employees received a predictable monthly income in retirement. However, estimating pension liabilities became complex for companies, and funding these plans from corporate earnings affected profits.Many companies opted to freeze or eliminate their pension plans and transition to defined-contribution plans. Employees now bear the investment risk and are responsible for managing their retirement savings through options like 401(k)s or IRAs. Thus, the importance of personal savings, tax-advantaged retirement plans, wise investment choices, and prudent spending is emphasized today to achieve a financially secure retirement.Story continuesCOVID-19 Sparked 'Unretirement' TrendGiven the hard time the retirees face in the absence of a traditional pension, the number of people working past retirement age has been steadily increasing. In the US, 32% of individuals aged 65 to 69 were still employed in 2017, compared to 22% in 1994. Similarly, in the UK, employment rates for individuals older than 65 doubled between 1993 and 2018.During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an initial exodus of older professionals from the workforce, with at least an extra 250,000 50-to-64-year-olds leaving their jobs in the UK and over 3 million Americans retiring early. However, inflation and financial concerns have led to a rise in the number of people ""unretiring."" In the US, Indeed.com reports that ""unretirement"" levels are currently at 3.3%, higher than the sub-3% average since 2017.In the UK, there has been a surge in 55-to-64-year-olds urgently seeking work, and two-thirds of people who retired during the pandemic expect to continue working in some capacity. These numbers reflect the changing landscape of retirement and the increasing need for older individuals to work beyond the traditional retirement age.Do All Retirees Want to Work After Retirement?Labor economist Teresa Ghilarducci suggested that coaxing retired workers back into the workforce could alleviate labor shortages, particularly in industries like healthcare and childcare. However, many employers are reluctant with it, with age discrimination leading to increased layoffs of older workers and their higher salary demands. Also, some retirees may simply have no intention of returning to work.The trend of higher retirement rates among baby boomers has been ongoing, but the pandemic has brought it into sharper focus, revealing long-standing labor force trends that have been slow to be acknowledged. You can read more about the problem of labor shortage in the US in our list of the biggest issues in America and the companies working on solving them.Hence, for many who are unable or unwilling to work after retirement, pensions serve as a critical lifeline, providing financial stability and support during their non-working years. These individuals rely on pensions to meet their basic needs and maintain a decent standard of living, especially when they may face limitations or health challenges that prevent them from engaging in employmentIt has also been reported that 75% of retirees are failing to meet their retirement income goals. In the US, while Social Security provides a safety net, the average yearly payment of $21,968 covers only a fraction of retirees' expenses. Additionally, most retirees have limited personal savings, with a median total savings of $54,300 and income from savings averaging $1,814. In contrast, retirees with pensions enjoy greater income security, as the median pension income for those aged 65 and older is $10,606, contributing significantly to their overall financial well-being.Pensions also have a broader impact on the economy, as they represent the world's largest source of capital, with approximately $25.8 trillion invested. However, the cost of providing pensions in tax subsidies amounts to $332 billion, demonstrating the significance of this benefit. These figures underscore the importance of pensions in supplementing Social Security, providing retirees with a more comfortable income, and contributing to the overall stability and growth of the economy.Although remote jobs with pensions are rare, there are easy part-time retirement jobs that pay well with remote positions that many retirees may consider, as traditional pensions seem to be fade.What Industries Still Offer Pensions?Firstly, in the public sector, government jobs at the federal, state, and local levels provide defined benefit plans, such as the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) for federal employees. Secondly, military personnel can receive retirement pay after serving for a minimum number of years, typically 20, along with additional benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs.Thirdly, the utility sector, including electric, gas, and water companies, often negotiate pension plans for their unionized employees. Lastly, in the education sector, colleges and universities offer pension plans to faculty and staff, although a shift towards 401(k) plans has been observed.As far as companies are concerned, Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN), Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP) are some of the biggest companies that offer pensions.In 2022, Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) rewarded its employees with an 8% bonus as a testament to its robust financial performance and remarkable profits resulting from the increased prices in the oil and gas industry. This gratifying gesture was extended to the majority of Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL)'s extensive workforce of 82,000 employees across the globe, demonstrating the company’s focus on employee benefits.Moreover, PepsiCo, Inc (NYSE:PEP) has made changes to its retirement savings plan for certain hourly employees. Started from January 2023, PepsiCo, Inc (NYSE:PEP) contributes an additional amount of money to their 401(k) plan. The exact amount of the contribution is between 6% and 8% of the employees' pay.Let's now go to our list of jobs that still pay traditional pensions.15 Jobs That Still Offer Traditional PensionsTaLaNoVa/Shutterstock.comMethodologyOur methodology for listing 15 jobs that still offer traditional pensions is based on assessing industrial stability. Further, we conducted thorough research using reputable sources such as relevant Subreddits on reddit, and Quora discussions to assess what employees have to say about these jobs on the ground.By analyzing industries with a long-standing history of providing pension benefits to their employees, we aimed to identify sectors that have consistently demonstrated their commitment to retirement security. This approach allowed us to curate a list of jobs that offer pensions.Here is a list of 15 Jobs That Still Offer Traditional Pensions:15. Public transit operatorPublic transit operators in the United States may have access to traditional pensions, depending on the specific transit agency and its policies.Many public transit agencies in the United States, such as Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), Chicago Transit Authority (CTA), and San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA), offer retirement plans that include traditional pensions for their transit operators. These defined benefit pension plans ensure a guaranteed retirement income based on years of service and salary.14. Police officerPolice officers often receive traditional pensions, for the purpose to attract and retain qualified personnel for demanding and risky jobs. As public sector employees, their pension plans are typically part of government benefit packages. Pensions provide a stable and secure retirement income, ensuring financial security for police officers who dedicate their careers to protecting and serving their communities.13. FirefighterSimilar to the case of police officers, given the nature of their work, which involves protecting lives and property in emergency situations, traditional pension plans provide firefighters with long-term financial security and stability during retirement. These pensions are typically part of government benefit packages and help ensure the well-being of firefighters who selflessly serve and protect their communities.12. TeacherTeaching is a critical profession that requires specialized skills and knowledge. Traditional pension plans serve as a significant incentive by providing teachers with a reliable and secure retirement income. The majority of public school teachers, approximately 90%, are enrolled in defined-benefit pension plans. These plans calculate a teacher's retirement benefits using clear formulas that consider factors such as their salary and years of experience.11. Airline pilotAirline pilots in the US receive traditional pensions for the acknowledgement of their long-term commitment to the profession. Retirement values for a 35-year career as an airline pilot at major US airlines can vary between $1.8 million and over $3 million. When a defined benefit program is in place, retirement benefits are typically estimated at 7.5 percent of the program's value. Alternatively, retirement benefits can be estimated at 3% of the pilot's final annual salary.10. DoctorDoctors in the US are often provided traditional pensions as a means to recognize their dedication to the medical profession and incentivize long-term commitment. While doctors do earn higher than average salaries during their careers, pensions serve as a valuable retirement benefit that ensures their financial security and rewards their years of service and contributions to the noble sector of healthcare.9. NurseNurses are mostly part of the defined benefit (DB) pension plans, which are the ""gold standard"" of pensions as they guarantee a specific retirement allowance based on a predetermined formula. With the assurance of a promised amount, nurses typically have excellent retirement plans that provide financial security after their retirement. It is also a highly sought-after option for Part-time Retirement Jobs that Pay Well, given the high salaries they make on average. It is one of the best jobs with pensions.8. State and Local Government EmployeeGovernment jobs are prominently among the jobs still offering traditional pensions. In fact, close to 86% of state and local government employees in the United States are eligible for traditional pension plans. These plans remain prevalent within the government sector, both at the federal and state/local levels. While some state and local governments have transitioned to defined contribution plans, defined benefit pensions are still widely available for new government employees. Union government workers are more likely to have access to pensions compared to nonunion employees.7. Utility workersAccording to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), around 76% of utility company employees in the US receive pension coverage. While some utility companies have closed their pension plans to recent hires, they continue to provide pension benefits to existing workers. The presence of unions in many utility companies plays a role in preserving pension plans.Duke Energy Corp (NYSE:DUK) and NextEra Energy Inc (NYSE:NEE) are two big names in the US associated with utility sector that offer generous retirement pension plans to their employees.6. Railroad workerRailroad workers in the US, specifically those employed by companies under the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB), are eligible for traditional pension benefits through the Railroad Retirement system. This system provides retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to qualified railroad employees and their families based on their years of service and earnings.Click here to see 5 Jobs That Still Offer Traditional Pensions.Suggested Articles:25 Most Boring Jobs that Pay $100,000 or More25 Part Time Retirement Jobs that Pay Well15 Cheapest Countries for RetirementDisclosure: None. 15 Jobs That Still Offer Traditional Pensions is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

(NASDAQ:PEP) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for PepsiCo PepsiCo Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Independent Director, Robert Pohlad, sold US$13m worth of shares at a price of US$174 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$185, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. This single sale was just 6.6% of Robert Pohlad's stake.Insiders in PepsiCo didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

(Hint: insiders have been buying them).Does PepsiCo Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. PepsiCo insiders own 0.1% of the company, currently worth about US$339m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At PepsiCo Tell Us?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the PepsiCo insiders selling. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing PepsiCo.

(NASDAQ:REGN) shareholders are probably generally happy, the stock hasn't had particularly good run recently, with the share price falling 13% in the last quarter. But that doesn't change the fact that shareholders have received really good returns over the last five years. Indeed, the share price is up an impressive 102% in that time. We think it's more important to dwell on the long term returns than the short term returns. The more important question is whether the stock is too cheap or too expensive today.While the stock has fallen 8.3% this week, it's worth focusing on the longer term and seeing if the stocks historical returns have been driven by the underlying fundamentals. See our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over half a decade, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals managed to grow its earnings per share at 24% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 15% over the same period. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' earnings, revenue and cash flow.A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 20% in the last twelve months. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 15%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. Before spending more time on Regeneron Pharmaceuticals it might be wise to click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling shares.Story continuesBut note: Regeneron Pharmaceuticals may not be the best stock to buy.

These include wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD), diabetic macular edema (DME) and diabetic retinopathy (DR).Regeneron has reported that the cause for the CRL is only an ongoing review of inspection findings at a third-party filler. The company reaffirmed that the CRL was not levied due to issues with the clinical efficacy or safety, trial design and labeling or drug substance manufacturing of aflibercept 8 mg. Furthermore, the company also stated that the FDA had not requested any additional clinical data or studies for the drug candidate.REGN intends to work closely with the FDA as well as the third-party filler to make aflibercept 8 mg available to patients with wAMD, DME and DR at the earliest.Shares were down 9% on the news despite no reported issues with the efficacy or safety of the drug candidate itself. Year to date, shares of Regeneron have lost 0.8% compared with the industry’s fall of 9%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWe would like to remind the investors that REGN is jointly developing aflibercept 8 mg with Bayer AG BAYRY. Currently, Bayer and Regeneron jointly market Eylea (aflibercept) inside and outside the United States as part of the collaboration agreement. Per the terms of the agreement, Bayer holds the license to exclusive marketing rights of Eylea outside of the United States and the profits from its sales are shared equally between the companies.Regeneron retains exclusive commercial rights to Eylea Injection and aflibercept 8 mg in the United States.It is important to note that REGN’s Eylea is a leader in the treatment of wAMD, DME and macular edema following retinal vein occlusion (RVO), which includes macular edema following central RVO and macular edema following branch RVO. The FDA recently approved Eylea to treat preterm infants with retinopathy of prematurity.Story continuesAflibercept 8 mg is currently not approved for use in any country. Regulatory filings are under review in the EU and Japan along with the United States. Regeneron also intends to submit applications for approvals in additional countries.In a separate press release, REGN reported positive top-line data from its pivotal PHOTON study of aflibercept 8 mg in patients with DME at the end of two years (96 weeks). The total patient population was divided into three cohorts, receiving aflibercept 8 mg doses in intervals of either 12 weeks or 16 weeks, after initially receiving three monthly doses of aflibercept 8 mg, or Eylea every 8 weeks.The objective of the pivotal PHOTON study is to evaluate the non-inferiority of aflibercept 8 mg 12-week and aflibercept 8 mg 16-week, compared with an 8-week dosing regimen of Eylea Injection after five initial monthly doses.Results from the study demonstrated that 89% of all aflibercept 8 mg patients maintained ≥12-week dosing intervals through two years compared with 93% through one year. Furthermore, 83% of the patients, assigned to a 16-week dosing regimen at baseline, maintained ≥16-week dosing intervals through two years compared with89% through one year. It was also observed that a significant number of patients fulfilled the extension criteria for even longer dosing intervals, including 43% for ≥20-week intervals and 27% for 24-week intervals.In conclusion, visual gains from treatment with aflibercept 8 mg and its safety profile were observed to be consistent with the established profile of Eylea 2 mg Injection.Regeneron also expects to report two-year data from its pivotal PULSAR study for aflibercept 8 mg in wAMD in the third quarter of 2023. Results from both the PHOTON and PULSAR studies are scheduled to be presented at a future medical conference.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and ConsensusRegeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

(NASDAQ: REGN) today announced top-line, two-year (96 weeks) data for aflibercept 8 mg from the pivotal PHOTON trial in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME). During the trial, aflibercept 8 mg patients were initially randomized to either 12- or 16-week dosing intervals (after three initial monthly doses) and were able to shorten or extend dosing intervals if pre-specified criteria were met. The longer-term data among aflibercept 8 mg patients who completed the trial demonstrated that the vast majority of patients were able to maintain or further extend these dosing intervals through two years with:89% maintaining ≥12-week dosing intervals through two years, compared to 93% through one year (48 weeks)83% maintaining ≥16-week dosing intervals through two years, compared to 89% maintaining a 16-week dosing interval through one year43% meeting the criteria for ≥20-week dosing intervals by week 96, including 16% and 27% who were eligible for 20- and 24-week dosing intervals, respectively“The two-year PHOTON results for aflibercept 8 mg in patients with diabetic macular edema are extremely compelling,” said Jeffrey Heier, M.D., Director of the Retina Service and Retina Research at Ophthalmic Consultants of Boston and a trial investigator. “To be able to rapidly achieve extended dosing intervals without any sacrifice of vision gains over two years is a tremendous benefit in the treatment of diabetic macular edema.”Story continues“The two-year PHOTON results certainly exceeded my expectations and indicate that the majority of patients may eventually be able to control their diabetic macular edema with as few as two or three aflibercept 8 mg injections per year, if approved by regulatory authorities, with similar excellent visual gains and a safety profile consistent with EYLEA given every 8 weeks,” said David M. Brown, M.D., FACS, Director of Research at Retina Consultants of Texas and a trial investigator. “Reducing the treatment burden in patients with diabetic macular edema is a critical unmet need, and the two-year PHOTON results reinforce the potential of aflibercept 8 mg to become the standard of care for the treatment of diabetic macular edema.”PHOTON (N=658) is a double-masked, active-controlled pivotal trial evaluating non-inferiority of aflibercept 8 mg 12-week (n=328) and 16-week (n=163) dosing regimens after three initial monthly doses compared to an 8-week dosing regimen for EYLEA (aflibercept) Injection (n=167) after five initial monthly doses. In addition to the vast majority of trial patients maintaining extended dosing intervals through two years, visual gains for aflibercept 8 mg remained consistent with the first year of the trial. Through 48 weeks (one year) Through 96 weeks (two years) EYLEA8-week regimenaflibercept 8 mg12-weekregimenaflibercept 8 mg16-weekregimen EYLEA8-week regimenaflibercept 8 mg12-weekregimenaflibercept 8 mg16-weekregimenMean number of injections^7.96.05.0 13.89.57.8Mean observed BCVA improvement, letters9.28.87.9 8.48.87.5LS mean (SE) change from baseline, letters8.7 (0.7)8.1 (0.6)7.2 (0.7) 7.7 (0.9)8.2 (0.6)6.6 (0.8)Difference in LS mean (95% CI), letters -0.6*(-2.3, 1.1)-1.4†(-3.3, 0.4)  +0.5‡(-1.6, 2.5)-1.1§(-3.3, 1.1)Proportion of patients losing ≥15 letters, per LOCF1.2%2.1%0.6% 3.6%3.4%1.2%BCVA: best corrected visual acuity; LS: least squares; SE: standard error; LOCF: last observation carried forward^Based on patients completing week 48 or 96 in the trial*Non-inferiority p-value: p&lt;0.0001†Non-inferiority p-value: p=0.0031‡Nominal non-inferiority p-value: p&lt;0.0001§Nominal non-inferiority p-value: p=0.0044In PHOTON, the safety of aflibercept 8 mg also continued to be similar to EYLEA through two years and remained consistent with the known safety profile of EYLEA from previous clinical trials for DME. Ocular treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) occurring in ≥5% of patients in any treatment group, in decreasing frequency, were cataract, vitreous floaters, and conjunctival hemorrhage. There were no cases of retinal vasculitis, occlusive retinitis or endophthalmitis. The rate of intraocular inflammation was 1.2% for both the EYLEA and aflibercept 8 mg groups. Anti-platelet trialists' collaboration-defined arterial thromboembolic TEAEs occurred in 7.2% of patients treated with EYLEA and 6.5% of patients treated with aflibercept 8 mg.“The aflibercept 8 mg clinical trial program is the first to demonstrate that patients with diabetic macular edema can immediately be treated with every 12- or 16-week dosing after their initial monthly doses and experience lasting vision control,” said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., Board Co-Chair, President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron, and a principal inventor of EYLEA. “With these two-year results, Regeneron continues to raise the bar in clinical advancements for retinal treatments and remains committed to pursuing groundbreaking innovations in ophthalmology.”The two-year data from the pivotal PULSAR trial for aflibercept 8 mg in wet age-related macular degeneration are expected in the third quarter of 2023, and the two-year data from both PHOTON and PULSAR are planned for presentation at an upcoming medical meeting.Aflibercept 8 mg is investigational, and its safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority. Aflibercept 8 mg is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Bayer AG, with Regeneron sponsoring the PHOTON trial. In the U.S., Regeneron maintains exclusive rights to EYLEA and aflibercept 8 mg. Bayer has licensed the exclusive marketing rights outside of the U.S., where the companies share equally the profits from sales of EYLEA and aflibercept 8 mg following any regulatory approvals.About the Aflibercept 8 mg Clinical Trial Program PULSAR in wAMD and PHOTON in DME are double-masked, active-controlled pivotal trials that are being conducted in multiple centers globally. In both trials, patients were randomized into 3 treatment groups to receive either: aflibercept 8 mg every 12 weeks, aflibercept 8 mg every 16 weeks, or EYLEA every 8 weeks. The lead sponsors of the trials were Bayer for PULSAR and Regeneron for PHOTON.Patients treated with aflibercept 8 mg in both trials had 3 initial monthly doses, and patients treated with EYLEA received 3 initial doses in PULSAR and 5 in PHOTON. In the first year, patients in the aflibercept 8 mg groups could have their dosing intervals shortened down to an every 8-week interval if protocol-defined criteria for disease progression were observed. Intervals could not be extended until the second year of the study. Patients in all EYLEA groups maintained a fixed 8-week dosing regimen throughout their participation in the trials.About DMEDME is a common complication in eyes of people living with diabetes. DME occurs when high levels of blood sugar lead to damaged blood vessels in the eye that leak fluid into the macula. This can lead to vision loss and, in some cases, blindness. Of the nearly 28 million American adults living with diabetes, an estimated 1.2 million have DME.About Ophthalmology at RegeneronAt Regeneron, we relentlessly pursue groundbreaking innovations in eye care science to help maintain the eye health of the millions of Americans impacted by vision-threatening conditions. Over a decade ago, our breakthrough scientific research resulted in the development of EYLEA, a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor designed to block the growth of new blood vessels and decrease the ability of fluid to pass through blood vessels in the eye. EYLEA has since brought fundamental change to the retinal disease treatment landscape and is supported by a robust body of research that includes eight pivotal Phase 3 trials, 11 years of real-world experience, and more than 60 million EYLEA injections globally.Regeneron continues to advance our anti-angiogenesis expertise with new solutions with the aim of offering optimal flexibility for a broad group of patients and eye care professionals. This includes aflibercept 8 mg, which has been developed with the aim of extending the time between injections, while maintaining the vision gains, anatomic benefits and safety previously observed with EYLEA.IMPORTANT EYLEA SAFETY INFORMATION AND INDICATIONSINDICATIONSEYLEA (aflibercept) Injection 2 mg (0.05 mL) is indicated for the treatment of patients with Neovascular (Wet) Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), Macular Edema following Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO), Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) and Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) (0.4 mg [0.01 mL]).CONTRAINDICATIONSEYLEA is contraindicated in patients with ocular or periocular infections, active intraocular inflammation, or known hypersensitivity to aflibercept or to any of the excipients in EYLEA.WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSIntravitreal injections, including those with EYLEA, have been associated with endophthalmitis and retinal detachments. Proper aseptic injection technique must always be used when administering EYLEA. Patients and/or caregivers should be instructed to report any signs and/or symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment without delay and should be managed appropriately. Intraocular inflammation has been reported with the use of EYLEA.Acute increases in intraocular pressure have been seen within 60 minutes of intravitreal injection, including with EYLEA. Sustained increases in intraocular pressure have also been reported after repeated intravitreal dosing with VEGF inhibitors. Intraocular pressure and the perfusion of the optic nerve head should be monitored and managed appropriately.In infants with ROP, reactivation of abnormal angiogenesis and tortuosity may occur following treatment with EYLEA. Infants should be monitored closely after injection with EYLEA until retinal vascularization has completed or until the examiner is assured that reactivation of ROP will not occur. Treatment with EYLEA will necessitate extended periods of ROP monitoring and additional EYLEA injections and/or laser treatments may be necessary.There is a potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors, including EYLEA. ATEs are defined as nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or vascular death (including deaths of unknown cause). The incidence of reported thromboembolic events in wet AMD studies during the first year was 1.8% (32 out of 1824) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 1.5% (9 out of 595) in patients treated with ranibizumab; through 96 weeks, the incidence was 3.3% (60 out of 1824) in the EYLEA group compared with 3.2% (19 out of 595) in the ranibizumab group. The incidence in the DME studies from baseline to week 52 was 3.3% (19 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 2.8% (8 out of 287) in the control group; from baseline to week 100, the incidence was 6.4% (37 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 4.2% (12 out of 287) in the control group. There were no reported thromboembolic events in the patients treated with EYLEA in the first six months of the RVO studies.ADVERSE REACTIONSSerious adverse reactions related to the injection procedure have occurred in &lt;0.1% of intravitreal injections with EYLEA including endophthalmitis and retinal detachment.The most common adverse reactions (≥5%) reported in patients receiving EYLEA were conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain, cataract, vitreous detachment, vitreous floaters, and intraocular pressure increased.In pre-term infants with ROP receiving EYLEA the most common adverse reactions (≥4%) reported were retinal detachment, conjunctival hemorrhage, and intraocular pressure increased. Adverse reactions established for adult indications are considered applicable to pre-term infants with ROP, though not all were observed in the clinical studies.Patients may experience temporary visual disturbances after an intravitreal injection with EYLEA and the associated eye examinations. Advise patients not to drive or use machinery until visual function has recovered sufficiently.For more information, please see full Prescribing Information.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents, develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Martin Shkreli Stock Picks and Their Performance.Martin Shkreli a.k.a. ""Pharma Bro"" is known for a variety of reasons, many of which are tinged with notoriety. He cofounded MSMB Capital Management (a company that specializes in long-term investments in healthcare and biotechnology businesses); he is the former CEO and Co-founder of Retrophin; and also the former CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals and KaloBios Pharmaceuticals Inc.Shkreli faced criticism in 2015 for significantly increasing the price of the HIV medication Daraprim, which was considered essential for saving lives. The cost of the drug jumped from approximately $13.50 to a staggering $750 overnight. This price surge came after the FDA approved the decades-old drug for treating toxoplasmosis, a major contributor to focal central nervous system disease in individuals with AIDS. Shkreli was charged and convicted on two counts of securities fraud and one count of conspiring to commit securities fraud. He was later sentenced to 7 years of jail time and up to $7.4 million in fines.Martin Shkreli started MSMB Capital Management in 2009 together with his friend Marek Biestek where they shorted biotech companies and spread the flaws of these companies to investors and to the public.In 2011, under the MSMB umbrella, he founded Retrophin, a portfolio company that focused on biotechnology to create treatments for rare diseases. He was ousted as the company's CEO because of committing stock-trading irregularities and other violations of securities rules. Retrophin was rebranded as Travere Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:TVTX) in an effort to further distance the company from Shkreli.After his stint with Retrophin, he founded Turing Pharmaceuticals in 2015 where the controversy over the Daraprim price started. Shkreli also led an investor group in November 2015 and acquired a majority stake in KaloBios Pharmaceuticals. He was chosen to be CEO of the company but was then terminated after his arrest on December 2015.Story continuesShkreli was subpoenaed to appear before the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the U.S. House of Representatives to answer questions about the Daraprim price increase, but he followed his lawyer's advice and refused to answer any questions during the hearings.Charges were filed against Shkreli and he was arrested in December 2015 after an investigation into his tenure at MSMB Capital Management and Retrophin.On August 4, 2017, the trial jury found Shkreli guilty of two counts of securities fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud. Shkreli described his prosecution as ""a witch hunt of epic proportions"". He was sentenced to 7-year imprisonment and to forfeit more than $7.3 million of his assets. Martin Shkreli was also ordered to pay a civil fine of $64.6 million to compensate victims. However, he was granted an early release from the low-security federal prison in Allenwood, Pennsylvania, on May 18, 2022.Martin Shkreli revealed his latest AI tool, named ""Dr. Gupta,"" on Twitter earlier this year. During a Twitter Spaces event, Shkreli shared that his new large language model was trained using data sourced from online medical journals which can be found on the web.Martin Shkreli Stock Picks and Their PerformanceBy House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform - https://www.flickr.com/photos/oversight/25044779546/in/photostream/, Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=54893482Our MethodologyFor this article we picked stocks Shkreli gave positive comments about on Reddit and YouTube. Five years ago, Shkreli engaged in an AMA on Reddit, during which he discussed certain stocks that he held a positive outlook on. We selected a few stocks from that particular thread. We also saw several videos posted by Martin Shkreli on his YouTube channel in which he analyzes stocks. We only picked companies he's bullish on. That does not necessarily mean Shkreli has stakes in these companies.Martin Shkreli Stock Picks and Their Performance10. AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (NYSE:AMC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 161-Year Stock Performance: -71%AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (NYSE:AMC) is actively involved in the business of theatrical exhibitions, utilizing its subsidiary companies to carry out its operations in this field.As of the end of the past quarter of 2023, 16 hedge funds had stakes in AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (NYSE:AMC). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (NYSE:AMC) during the latest period was Philippe Laffont's Coatue Management which owns 4,212,158 shares of the company worth $21 million.Martin Shkreli mentioned AMC in one of his YouTube streams and explained why he thinks AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (NYSE:AMC) is a great investment choice. Here's what he said:""I actually think AMC gets a good deal. The fact that they get all this margin just on the film, and then 80% margin on food and beverage. It's not a bad business. It's a pretty good business model. It's pretty capital-intensive. They actually have buying power too, whereas other theaters don't have as much buying power.""9. Sony Corporation (NYSE:SONY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 301-Year Stock Performance: +6.98%Tokyo, Japan-based Sony Corporation (NYSE:SONY) is an electric equipment designer, music producer, and game developer.Earlier this year, Martin Shkreli mentioned Sony Corporation (NYSE:SONY) in one of his YouTube streams and said:“The company made $1.1 trillion in cash in 2021, and made $1.2 trillion in cash in 2022. The market cap is about $15 trillion. So would you pay $15 trillion to get $1.2 trillion a year? Possibly a growing $1.2 trillion a year. That seems pretty good but is it free cash flow or not? Sony has clearly cash flow potential of a trillion in a year, which in a current market cap of $15 trillion sounds pretty good for a slow grower. Its average growth is 5%, so earning should grow to 7% with little leverage. Music is their best division from a profitability perspective and arguably music doesn’t quite give games a run for its money but pound for pound it certainly does. Music plus imaging is actually bigger than games in terms of profit. My verdict on SONY is its okay. It’s not something to write home about but it could be an “okay” stock if it gets cheaper. It’s certainly worth paying attention to given their status in the ecosystem of several different spheres of influence.”8. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. Although, when we looked at Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Union Pacific:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.16 = US$9.7b ÷ (US$66b - US$6.2b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Thus, Union Pacific has an ROCE of 16%.  That's a relatively normal return on capital, and it's around the 14% generated by the Transportation industry. Check out our latest analysis for Union Pacific roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Union Pacific compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Union Pacific here  for free.The Trend Of ROCEThere hasn't been much to report for Union Pacific's returns and its level of capital employed because both metrics have been steady for the past five years. It's not uncommon to see this when looking at a mature and stable business that isn't re-investing its earnings because it has likely passed that phase of the business cycle. So unless we see a substantial change at Union Pacific in terms of ROCE and additional investments being made, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger. With fewer investment opportunities, it makes sense that Union Pacific has been paying out a decent 44% of its earnings to shareholders. Given the business isn't reinvesting in itself, it makes sense to distribute a portion of earnings among shareholders.Story continuesThe Bottom LineIn summary, Union Pacific isn't compounding its earnings but is generating stable returns on the same amount of capital employed. Since the stock has gained an impressive 60% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.One more thing, we've spotted   1 warning sign  facing Union Pacific that you might find interesting.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?
