The speakers on today’s call are Dennis Degner, Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Scucchi, Chief Financial Officer.

We’ve also posted supplemental tables on our website that include realized pricing details by product along with calculations of EBITDAX, cash margins and other non-GAAP measures. With that, let me turn the call over to Dennis.', 'Dennis Degner: Thanks, Laith, and thanks to all of you for joining the call today. Range’s 2023 plan was successfully executed with a consistent theme throughout the year. Operating safely while driving continued operational improvements, generating free cash flow with a peer leading capital efficiency and prudent allocation of that free cash flow balancing returns of capital to shareholders with further debt reduction and the long-term development of our world-class asset base. I believe our fourth quarter results are a great example of continued advancement against those key objectives and showcase the resilience of Range’s business in a low point of a cycle. Likewise, our year end reserves update and 16th consecutive year of positive performance revisions points to the repeatable nature of our Marcellus inventory.', 'As we look towards the year ahead, you will hear those themes repeated and I believe the resilience that our business has in a lower price environment will be a key differentiator for Range. Maintaining a flexible hedge program to cover fixed costs and capital commitments is clearly beneficial in periods of price weakness like we find ourselves in today. However, the real value proposition over the long run is underpinned by Range’s low sustaining capital requirements. Our low capital intensity is the result of Range’s class leading drilling and completion costs, shallow base decline, large blocky core inventory and talented team. Altogether, these results in a required reinvestment rate that is lower than any of our peers, which provides Range a solid foundation for consistently generating significant free cash flow and returns to shareholders.', 'Further bolstering Range’s durability is our liquids contribution, which is approximately 30% of our total production volume. Our liquids revenue is expected to provide an uplift to natural gas prices and using today’s strip pricing it’s very meaningful. For context, Range’s NGL barrel is currently priced around $24 per barrel using strip prices for 2024. That is equivalent to a $1.60 per MCF premium to recent Henry Hub pricing. When we roll all of that together, our liquids revenue uplift, our low maintenance capital and a thoughtful hedging program, you get the lowest break-even among natural gas producers and the most resilient organic free cash flow as evidenced by our 2023 results and 2024 projections. Importantly, with our vast inventory of derisked high-quality Marcellus wells, we have the ability to compound our per share growth in free cash flow for decades to come.', 'Turning to our near-term plans. For 2024 Range expects to generate healthy free cash flow at strip pricing with all-in capital spending between $620 million and $670 million. This capital plan consists of approximately $575 million to support our base level maintenance production plan similar to the past few years, along with additional investments in three categories. First, is additional acreage spending above maintenance levels which not only allows for longer laterals but actually offsets most of our lateral footage being turned to sales keeping our 28 million feet of core Marcellus inventory relatively unchanged. Second, is an investment in expanding our water infrastructure which provides a very quick payback and supports a low D&C and LOE cost in the future.', 'And lastly, is flexible drilling and completion capital, like we had in 2023, which increases our year-end inventory of drilled and/or completed lateral footage providing us optionality and flexibility as we evaluate the optimum setup for following years. The overall number of drilling rigs and frac crews will be the same as last year with the additional inventory generated as a result of simply retaining the equipment, which maintains operational efficiencies and provides flexibility for 2025 and beyond given the macro backdrop. Range is planning a maintenance production profile that is similar to recent years at 2.12 BCF equivalent per day to 2.16 BCF equivalent per day. Approximately three-quarters of the lateral footage that will turn to sales this year will be located across our wet and super-rich acreage positions providing the added benefit of our NGL uplift to overall cash flow and price realizations.', 'With the remainder of our program focused in our dry gas footprint. Our operational cadence for 2024 will consist of two horizontal drilling rigs operating throughout the year resulting in the total combined footage of approximately 750,000 lateral feet being drilled or about 100,000 feet more than what we will turn to sales. 2024 completions will be executed utilizing a single new electric fracturing fleet operating through the year as well. Consistent with a maintenance production program approximately 640,000 lateral feet from 50 new wells is expected to go into production in 2024, with more than half of the new wells being drilled developed on pads with existing production. Returning to pads with existing production has been a repeatable part of the Range story for many years and supports both our capital and operational efficiency.', 'Similar to prior years, our activity and capital will be weighted towards the front half of the year, while our quarterly production profile is expected to be back half weighted as the new turning lines materialize in the back half of 2024. First quarter production is expected to be around 2.1 BCF equivalent per day before building into the second half of the year. Our operational review for the past year showcased a continued theme of execution excellence that starts with our drilling highlights. 2023 saw several new efficiency records set for the program, while drilling a total combined lateral footage of nearly 700,000 feet. The team managed to drill eight of the top 15 longest laterals in Range’s program history with 40% exceeding 15,000 feet laterally.', 'Four of the wells had a lateral lengths greater than 20,000 feet with the longest two laterals extending four miles. Our large contiguous acreage position affords us the ability to drill these type of long laterals, increasing efficiencies and allowing us to access more reserves from a single location, all while reducing our overall footprint and consolidating infrastructure requirements. In addition to the new horizontal length records set by the team, we also set new benchmark rates for daily drill footage. The average daily lateral footage drilled in 2023 was more than 4,600 feet per day, a step change increase of 38% over the previous year, with the fastest drilling day exceeding 7,450 feet drilled in a 24-hour period. The efficiency gains we see from longer laterals and faster daily drilling rates are key to the program’s success, but equally important was that the team managed to simultaneously improve its pinpoint accuracy when in zone.', 'Over the years, our drilling and geoscience teams have set an extremely precise standard for our horizontal targeting, typically with a tolerance of less than 20 feet. In 2023, with all the long lateral and high drilling rate success the team had, they did it while staying within their high graded targets for more than 93% of the lateral footage drilled in the year. A noteworthy achievement by the team. This type of laser focus plays a role in the positive performance revisions and consistent reserve reporting that investors have come to expect from Range. Moving to completions, several new completion efficiency records were established during the year to include the following; increasing overall efficiencies to nine stages per day, a 10% improvement over the prior mark which was just set in 2022; achieving our highest pad average of 13.4 stages per day, a mark set during the fourth quarter; successfully completing Range’s longest well to-date with a total measure depth of 29,500 feet and setting a new record of 17 stages completed in a 24-hour period.', 'These incremental gains in operational efficiency could not have been accomplished without reliable logistics supporting each stage and the Range water operations and logistics team played a critical role in supporting these efforts. But these operational results are incomplete if we can’t execute safely. In addition to the highlights shared today, the team also delivered on one of our best safety and environmental performances in the company’s history. We look forward to sharing more on these results in our upcoming Corporate Sustainability Report in the months ahead. Turning quickly to marketing. During the quarter, Range’s weighted average NGL price was $24.91 per barrel. This is a $2.42 per barrel premium to the Mont Belvieu Index and the highest quarterly premium in company history.', 'This performance was driven by Range’s flexible LPG export program and strong seasonal butane values during the quarter. Full year 2023 saw $1.24 per barrel NGL premium and was also a company best on an annual basis. We expect Range to maintain a differential to the Belvieu Index of $1 minus to $1 premium for 2024 by leveraging our export capacity and flexible transportation options. To the extent that export dynamics remain tight in the Gulf Coast, as they were in the second half of 2023, we would expect our access to the East Coast to be advantaged, pushing us toward the premium side of our guidance. And as I mentioned at the beginning of these remarks, Range’s NGL barrel is currently priced well above natural gas prices, supporting our durable free cash flow profile.', 'Turning to natural gas. Near-term prices are obviously incredibly challenging for the industry and we expect these historically low price levels should help keep a lid on natural gas production across the U.S. We’re encouraged by reduced industry activity in the Haynesville and Tier 2 basins, along with maintenance programs being planned in the Marcellus. This moderated industry activity, along with LNG project startups expected in the second half of 2024 and continued strength in gas power generation, provides the potential for the domestic market to rebalance later this year. While beyond this year, continued growth and global demand for U.S. natural gas, combined with domestic power and industrial demand and Tier 1 well inventory exhaustion, all set up a strong outlook for long-term U.S. gas fundamentals.', 'Before handing over to Mark, I’ll reiterate a message we’ve shared previously. We believe the future of natural gas and NGLs is strong, and the Range team remains focused on generating free cash flow, while advancing our overall efficiencies and delivering repeatable well performance across our large contiguous inventory. I believe the positive results we generated in 2023 and plan to build upon in 2024 are a reflection of that focus and show the resilience of Range’s business. I’ll now turn it over to Mark to discuss the financials.', 'Mark Scucchi: Thanks Dennis. 2023 highlighted the strengths and the weaknesses of companies in the energy sector. For upstream producers, quality assets with low full cycle costs, the ability to reach a diverse set of customers with a variety of price points and a rock solid balance sheet to provide flexibility were all necessary to create value. Range has each of these key attributes and through sound execution by the team, the company generated strong free cash flow, reduced debt, paid dividends, bought back shares and reinvested in operations, not only for maintenance, but to prudently position the company for the future. As we sit here in early 2024 with an efficient plan to maintain steady production, we are also carefully positioning the business for evolving domestic and international demand for natural gas and natural gas liquids.', 'As incremental demand materializes, Range will be positioned to be a reliable long-term energy supplier that generates strong returns from a resilient business. Let’s start with capital allocation in 2023. Cash flow before working capital of approximately $1.1 billion funded our capital investments of $614 million, a reduction in debt net of cash of $292 million, along with roughly $96 million in dividends and share repurchases. This allocation demonstrates the fact that in a low commodity price setting, Range comfortably maintained base production that drove strong cash flow on the back of cash margins equating to greater than 40% of realized price per unit. This resilient margin attributable to an advantageous commodity mix, paired with a diverse sales portfolio and competitive unit costs, allowed prudent investments in the business and cash returns from the business, while further strengthening the balance sheet.', 'Over the past two years, Range has reduced net debt by an aggregate $1.2 billion and returned capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends totaling $535 million. In total, that is more than $1.7 billion in capital returned to stakeholders. With a balance sheet in great shape and a reduced share count, continued resilient value generation is the goal. Driving 2023 strong financial results was the tireless operating team focused on safety and efficiency. The team delivered planned production at a competitive drilling and completion capital cost, which included building a few wells for inventory. With perhaps the lowest decline rate of comparable companies, Range’s capital efficiency stands out in terms of cost per MCFE, full cycle break-even costs and the required reinvestment rate of cash flow to maintain production.', 'As a percentage of cash flow, Range should regularly be near the lowest call on cash for sustaining CapEx. We expect this to be true of this asset base for many years. Focusing on the fourth quarter for a moment, operating results achieved cash flow before working capital of $300 million. Cash flow was a result of realized price per unit of $3.25 per MCFE. Margin benefited from lower expenses with an $0.11 reduction in unit costs compared to fourth quarter last year, driven primarily by lower GP&T and lower interest expense. Fourth quarter cash margins per unit of production were $1.42, a healthy 44% margin despite lower commodity prices. As we often mention, Range’s gas processing cost is linked to NGL prices such that gathering, processing and transportation expense decreased during the fourth quarter, serving as a right-way risk relationship between costs and pricing.', 'Also reducing costs in Q4 were lower fuel and electricity costs. Taxes have become a relevant topic with company profitability. In 2023, Range’s cash taxes are only at the state level for a total of roughly $1.5 million for the year. At year-end 2023, Range had federal NOL carry forwards totaling $1.8 billion. These NOLs will serve to reduce taxable income in coming years. For some added understanding, the first layer of federal NOLs totaling approximately $158 million can be used to reduce up to 100% of taxable income. The approximate remaining $1.7 billion of federal NOLs can be used to reduce up to 80% of a given year’s taxable income. At current strip pricing and Range’s expected profitability, we believe we will benefit from the full utilization of these NOL carry forwards in coming years.', 'Turning from 2023 accomplishments to where the company is headed in 2024, given the strong foundation provided by high quality assets and low financial leverage, we intend for Range’s strategic focus to remain consistent. Maximize the value of a multi-decade project inventory, generate free cash flow, prudently return capital and reinvest in the business. With a thoughtfully constructed hedging program, we seek to participate in improved long-term market dynamics, while increasing confidence in near-term forecasted cash flow, all to support consistent efficient operations, preserving the balance sheet and creating additional optionality around capital allocation. We believe Range’s results demonstrate a successful hedging philosophy that has served the company well and will continue to do so in the future.', 'Presently, Range has approximately 55% of 2024 natural gas hedged with an average floor price of $3.70, and in 2025, approximately 25% hedged with an average floor price of $4.11, providing Range a stable base to consistently generate free cash flow through market cycles. Range’s business plan continues to be executed on what we believe is the largest high quality asset in Appalachia, paired with a transport and sales portfolio delivering production across the U.S. and internationally, all underpinned by a strong financial foundation. We have the team, assets and balance sheet to succeed through price cycles, and we believe the Range business can and will continue to deliver significant value to investors. Dennis, back to you.', 'Dennis Degner: Thanks, Mark. Before moving to Q&A, I’d like to congratulate our team for their accomplishments discussed today and their dedication to our continued safety performance, operational improvements and progress towards our stated financial objectives. 2024 looks like it’s going to be a challenging year for the industry, but Range’s business has never been stronger, having derisked a high quality inventory measured in decades and translated that into a business capable of generating free cash flow through these types of cycles. With that, let’s open up the line for questions.', 'See also 20 Fastest Growing Biotech Companies in the US and 15 Easiest English-Speaking Countries to Immigrate to from US.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Workers’ Compensation Insurance revenues indicates a 2.2% year-over-year fall. Renewal rate is expected to decline year over year in the fourth quarter, driven by rate pressures to cover loss cost trends.', 'The negatives are expected to have been partially offset by higher investment income, thanks to the high-interest rate environment.

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments."", ""While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases."", 'State Street Corporation in Focus', ""State Street Corporation (STT) is headquartered in Boston, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of -6.51% since the start of the year. The company is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.69 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.81%. This compares to the Banks - Major Regional industry's yield of 3.87% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.6%."", ""Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $2.76 is up 4.5% from last year. In the past five-year period, State Street Corporation has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 7.65%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. State Street Corporation's current payout ratio is 36%, meaning it paid out 36% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend."", 'STT is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 is $7.87 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 2.74%.', 'Bottom Line', 'From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.', ""For instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that STT is not only an attractive dividend play, but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy)."", 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The volatility associated with cyclical economic swings means that investing is a medium whose returns are best measured across multiple years or even decades."", ""However, that doesn't mean investors should ignore a company's short-term prospects. Excellent 10-year operating runs are built from a series of individual good years, after all."", ""What does 2024 hold for Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST) stock, then, given the warehouse giant's recent positive operating momentum and soaring returns? Let's dive right in."", ""There are encouraging signs that the year ahead will bring more good news regarding growth. In early February, Costco announced that comparable-store sales were up a solid 5% through late January. That's about even with the pace investors have seen from Walmart (NYSE: WMT), the warehouse club chain's biggest competitor."", 'Notably, Costco is experiencing a big rebound in its e-commerce segment, which tends to sell more consumer discretionary products like furniture and jewelry. Strength here suggests that shoppers might be ready to spend more aggressively in 2024 after reigning in their budgets last year. If that happens, then Costco has a good shot at posting stronger customer traffic, along with a rebound in average spending per visit. These factors would support positive returns for shareholders.', ""Costco investors should keep their expectations in check when it comes to the chain's profit potential. Sure, 2024 will likely bring the company's first membership fee increase in over five years. Most of the chain's profits come from those subscriptions."", ""But management directs almost all that extra cash toward bolstering the chain's price leadership rather than allowing profit margins to rise. That explains why Costco still books the same 3% operating margin that shareholders have seen since the pre-pandemic days."", ""Peers like Walmart and Target (NYSE: TGT), meanwhile, have allowed margins to expand (and contract) along with the pace of sales growth. Costco's stock would likely rally if its operating profit margin rises in 2024. But investors can't count on this boost happening in the coming quarters."", ""Costco's stock is priced at an elevated premium that might limit shareholders' returns from here. Its price-to-sales ratio of over 1.3 is nearly double Walmart's valuation, in fact. It's also the highest premium that investors have paid for this stock in the past decade. There's a clear risk of paying too high of a price for this stock, in other words."", ""Your cash returns won't make up the difference, either. Costco just paid a huge special dividend that reduced its cash balance by over $7 billion. As a result, investors can't expect another big payout beyond the chain's current commitment of a 0.6% yield. You can earn a 1.3% yield from owning Walmart, for context, and a nearly 3% yield from Target stock."", ""There's every reason to expect Costco's business to achieve record sales and earnings in 2024, just as the business has through most of the past decade. Yet investors shouldn't expect those operating wins to translate directly into further market-beating returns for the stock given Costco's pricey valuation today."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Costco Wholesale right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Costco Wholesale, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Costco Wholesale wasn’t one of them.

Based on the market's knee-jerk reaction to this news, investors are clearly worried about the competitive threat for Roku."", 'A week later, Walmart officially announced its deal to acquire Vizio for $2.3 billion. Roku stock dropped again on the news.', ""There may be good reason for investors' concern. Roku generates revenue in two main ways: device sales and platform revenue. On the hardware side of things, Roku sells smart TVs and accessories with streaming capabilities. Last year, Walmart was a top-three retailer for Roku's devices."", ""Walmart even sponsored some original Roku streaming video content in 2023, helping it generate ad revenue. Therefore, Walmart is a key partner for both of Roku's revenue streams."", ""If Walmart acquired Vizio to compete with Roku, then it stands to reason it won't play so nicely in the future. But Roku investors can relax as Walmart likely has a much bigger target in mind -- a longtime rival with a $1.75 trillion market cap."", ""Walmart is likely much more interested in competing with e-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) than with Roku. In fact, this is what anonymous sources told The Wall Street Journal as well in relation to Walmart's acquisition."", 'Amazon has quietly become one of the most powerful digital advertising businesses in the world. In 2023, the company generated $47 billion in ad revenue. It grew this part of the business an impressive 26% year over year in the fourth quarter -- the best growth rate of any of its business segments.', ""The e-commerce giant is effective at advertising because it has a massive customer base, and it knows a lot about those customers. Every transaction on Amazon's marketplace provides the company with valuable data it can use to attract advertisers."", ""As the biggest retailer in the world, Walmart also has a large customer base, and it's working to better leverage its opportunity. In 2021, Walmart partnered with top demand-side advertising platform The Trade Desk\xa0to build Walmart's own demand-side capabilities. Then, in 2022, Walmart partnered with Roku to make streaming TV ads interactive and shoppable."", 'Therefore, it\'s no secret Walmart is working to become a force in digital advertising just like Amazon. That\'s how its interest in Vizio fits into the bigger picture. In Walmart\'s press release, management said that combining Vizio and Walmart\'s advertising businesses will ""redefine the intersection of retail and entertainment.""', 'For its part, Vizio has adopted a Roku-like strategy. Both Roku and Vizio sell physical hardware at a gross loss -- it costs more to make the devices than what they sell for. But this allows these companies to generate higher-margin revenue from operating system software.', ""Through the first three quarters of 2023, Vizio's device revenue of $753 million was down 31% year over year. However, its software revenue (what it calls Platform+) was up 24% to $424 million."", ""Device revenue still makes up the bulk of the top line for Vizio, so its decline has led to overall revenue slipping as well. However, the rising share of Platform+ revenue has boosted the company's gross profit margin."", ""Given these numbers, Vizio is obviously all-in on its ad-focused platform business, and that's what Walmart wants so it can go toe-to-toe with Amazon."", ""It would go too far to say this news from Walmart is irrelevant for Roku's shareholders. Indeed, Walmart could opt to give greater visibility to its own TV brands once the deal is closed, which would hurt Roku's sales."", 'But is this outcome probable?', ""Recall that Walmart is a top-three retailer for Roku's devices. Well, Amazon is also among the top three, and it's been selling competing Amazon-branded smart TVs for years. Despite the resulting competition from Amazon, Roku just surpassed 80 million active accounts, making it the largest player in this space. Not only that, it just added 10 million new accounts in 2023, its second-best year ever. History suggest this news from Walmart won't be enough to dethrone Roku."", ""Roku continues to outshine competitors with much deeper pockets. In light of this track record, the recent drop in Roku's stock price could be an opportunity for long-term investors."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Walmart right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Walmart, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Walmart wasn’t one of them.

The company has resisted a stock split over the last five years, though its share price topped $1,000 throughout most of the period. AutoZone could be content to keep its share price at an exceptionally high level.', ""Shares of Fair Isaac (NYSE: FICO) aren't nearly as expensive as AutoZone's, but they're a lot more expensive than Walmart's, recently trading at a little under $1,300. It's fair to say (pun fully intended) that Fair Isaac is a great candidate for a stock split."", ""The data analytics company has conducted four splits in the past. It first split its shares 2-for-1 on June 27, 1995. It did a 3-for-2 stock split on June 5, 2001, followed almost exactly a year later with another 3-for-2 split. The company's most recent stock split came on March 11, 2004 -- again, a 3-for-2 split."", ""Like AutoZone, Fair Isaac hasn't announced any plans for a stock split. But the company isn't accustomed to having its stock trade at over $1,000. It only reached four digits this year after soaring by 84% over the last 12 months."", ""Broadcom's (NASDAQ: AVGO) share price of over $1,200 isn't too much lower than Fair Isaac's. It also only recently topped the $1,000 mark after more than doubling over the last year."", 'The semiconductor and infrastructure software company\'s stock split history is a little convoluted. Avago acquired Broadcom in 2016, taking on the Broadcom name, but retaining its old stock ticker. Before that acquisition, Avago had never conducted a stock split. The ""new"" Broadcom hasn\'t split its shares since the acquisition, either. However, the ""old"" Broadcom that was acquired split its stock three times: a 2-for-1 split on Feb. 18, 1999, another 2-for-1 split on Feb. 14, 2000, and a final 3-for-2 split on Feb. 22, 2006.', ""Broadcom hasn't even hinted that it's weighing a stock split. However, if the stock remains at its current high level, I wouldn't be surprised if it decided that one was in order."", 'Whether or not AutoZone, Fair Isaac, and Broadcom conduct stock splits soon, they all have strong underlying businesses. The main concern with two of these stocks, though, is that their valuations are as nearly as sky-high as their share prices.', ""Fair Isaac trades at a nose-bleed forward price-to-earnings ratio of 49.5. Broadcom's shares trade at 26.8 times expected earnings. Only AutoZone has a reasonably attractive valuation, with a forward earnings multiple of 18.3.

These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available on our website in our fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings release, our supplemental information and our filings with the SEC.

Ed and team will provide some opening remarks, and then we'll open the call to questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed."", 'Edward Baltazar Pitoniak', ""Thank you, Samantha, and good morning, everyone. I'll start this morning with a few words about 2023 VICI accomplishments and the way forward. John Payne will share our 2024 growth approach, and David Kieske will discuss our 2023 financial results and our 2024 guidance. Last night, we announced final 2023 AFFO per share of $2.15, representing year-over-year per share growth of 11.8%. VICI's 2023 AFFO growth will likely make VICI one of the 2023 income growth leaders among the 29 S&P 500 REITs that report AFFO per share. There are 30 S&P 500 REITs overall, representing approximately 90% of the U.S. REIT equity market capitalization at year-end. VICI's 2023 growth is largely the result of work we did in 2022, forging new relationships and new investments in both gaming and [non-gaming] both property acquisitions and property credit investments. I'm proud of our 2023 AFFO per share growth but I'm also proud of what the VICI team did in 2023 to continue to produce growth for 2024 and beyond. Our investment activities in 2023 produced growth in our portfolio quality, geographic diversity, tenant diversity and income. Indeed, when it comes to 2024 income growth, as David will discuss in a moment regarding our 2024 guidance, we expect our projected 2024 AFFO per share growth should put VICI well into the top half of the S&P 500 REIT 2024 AFFO per share growth table. It wasn't easy to produce future growth in 2023. It was tough to navigate in 2023. Most days in 2023 and frankly, most days in 2024 so far, remind me of my days living and working in Whistler, British Columbia, where a very challenging coastal mountain environment could result in days so foggy and whited out that we describe such days as skiing inside a milk bottle. But even amidst this low visibility, the VICI team kept pioneering in 2023. We invested in new geographies, including 3 new countries and through our Bowlero acquisition in U.S. noncommercial gaming states such as Texas, California and North Carolina. We invested in new categories such as family recreation and youth sports. We expanded our partnerships with pilgrimage brands like Cabot and Canyon Ranch. We acquired the primary leasehold interest in New York's incomparable Chelsea Piers through our position as the leading owner of real estate on the Las Vegas Strip. We continue to work with our Las Vegas partners to capitalize on Las Vegas' leadership position in global entertainment and hospitality. I strongly believe VICI's investment in Las Vegas is one of the most compelling investments in the current global commercial real estate investing landscape, period, full stop. As we set out in our earnings release last night, in 2023, we announced and closed $1.8 billion of capital acquisitions and investments within the year. Note that these figures do not include the $2.8 billion closing of our Mandalay Bay MGM Grand joint venture in early January 2023, which we announced in early December 2022, including our assumption of the remaining $1.5 billion of CMBS debt. A fundamental importance our 2023 investing in gaming and nongaming was accretive. Our announced 2023 capital investments were made at a blended initial unlevered investment yield of 7.7%. Our 2023 investing was also balance sheet enhancing. We funded this $1.8 billion of investment with approximately $1.6 billion of cash and equity and only about $200 million of incremental debt. achieving an equity to debt funding ratio on that investment activity of 8:1, demonstrating our commitment to our long-range net leverage target of 5.0 to 5.5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. As we look ahead within 2024, despite the continued cloudy macroeconomic conditions and outlook we begin 2024 with approximately $1.2 billion of cash and forward equity resources to deploy into continuing accretive growth. Needless to say, the macro environment of constrained capital conditions, we believe our capital resources can and will be attractive to gaming and experiential operators who want to grow and/or need liquidity.Finally, in 2024, we will continue to build a portfolio of quality. You've heard me say before that I believe VICI is the pioneer in bringing Class A real estate to net lease. By Class A, we mean real estate of great scale, great quality and high mission criticality. And VICI enables investors to own Class A real estate within the strong economic transparency and integrity of the net lease model. What we can, must and will do is continue to enable existing and potential VICI investors to understand fully the scale, quality and mission criticality of our Class A real estate. To that end, we are proud to announce that we're launching today the VICI Properties photo book, a digital coffee table style book that brings to life the magnificence of the real estate owned by VICI. You can view this book online at our website, www.viciproperties.com. And I thank Hayes Honea of our team for her great work in producing and publishing this book. I strongly encourage you to give this book a good viewing. If you're a VICI shareholder, I believe the book will give you great pride in what you own. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to John."", 'John W. R. Payne', 'Thanks, Ed. Good morning to everyone. In 2023, VICI was able to navigate a volatile broader market backdrop, particularly for REITs and consistently deployed capital in accretive manners throughout the year. Over the course of 2023, we deployed $1.8 billion at a blended yield of approximately 7.7% across investments that expanded our geographic reach domestically and internationally, broadened our investable universe across gaming, hospitality and family entertainment and deepened our ability to invest creatively through property-related credit investments. Our ability to transact successfully last year was due in part to the multiyear effort I\'ve mentioned before on our earnings calls. Every day at VICI, our team shows up for work and focuses on developing and maintaining relationships with best-in-class growth-oriented operators. While some REITs describe themselves simply as a landlord and position themselves to extract value from their tenants. We view ourselves as a long-term capital partner collaborating with our tenants to create value. This philosophy of serving as a capital partner and prioritizing relationships with operators who pursue growth energetically serves as our compass as we assess and underwrite opportunities in the current environment. An environment that is characterized by low visibility and fluctuating cost of capital. To that end, many of you have heard me speak over the years about our focus on growth. And it\'s also important to understand that there have been numerous situations in which we elect to not pursue opportunities. VICI is in the very fortunate position to have created significant shareholder value over the years. For example, we\'ve grown our AFFO per share at an 8.5% CAGR from 2018 through 2023, while our dividend has grown at a comparable high single-digit rate, and we do not believe we need to pursue growth purely for the sake of growing. For those of you who may be newer to our story, I would like to touch on a few elements of our growth pillars that have allowed us to successfully complete $36 billion of accretive transaction volume in a little over 6 years. Number one, we work collaboratively with operating partners investing in growth opportunities and funding high ROI capital projects in order to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes. Number two, as the only S&P 500 REIT predominantly invested in the gaming industry, given 90% of our rent roll is derived from gaming investments, our team travels far and wide, visiting properties, studying new markets, assessing the landscape and meeting with operators across regional, Las Vegas and even international locations. Number three, we are supplementing our gaming investments with opportunities in experiential sectors that we believe are positioned to benefit from secular tailwinds. We focus on sourcing transactions with operators who position themselves for growth, including through roll-up in an industry, much as you saw with our Cabot and Bowlero transactions announced in October of last year. And finally, number four, we constantly keep our eyes open for opportunities where VICI can get better by getting bigger as demonstrated through the acquisition of MGM Growth Properties in 2022, which significantly expanded our footprint in Las Vegas, added Class A market-leading regional assets to our portfolio, improved our balance sheet to investment-grade and has positioned us for a long-term partnership with MGM Resorts, a world-class gaming, hospitality and leisure operator. As we dive further into 2024, we hold firm with the criteria that has driven much of our track record to date while executing across our strategic pillars. In particular, we are adhering to prudent underwriting standards, ensuring your capital is appropriately compensated as we assess risk and pursue opportunities across different properties, markets and asset classes. And as I said earlier, we maintain a preference for growth-focused operators with our entire team evaluating a partner\'s track record and importantly, their use of proceeds, which typically explains intentions behind pursuing the transaction. We ultimately believe the right partnerships lead to the right opportunities, which feeds the flywheel of value creation through collaboration. We believe our commitment to developing and deepening relationship with great operators of all shapes and sizes, combined with our strong balance sheet and liquidity position will afford us the ability to continue to executing accretive deals during time when other REITs may be stuck ""skiing inside a milk bottle."" Now I\'ll turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results and guidance. David?', 'David Andrew Kieske', ""Thank you, John. It's great to speak with everyone today, and we appreciate your time. I want to start with our balance sheet. 2023 exemplifies the continued discipline we have maintained of our 6-plus years of existence by ensuring that we allocate capital accretively, have a balance sheet and liquidity profile designed to weather all cycles and provide the safety and protection our equity and credit partners deserve. During the year, we raised over $1.6 billion in forward equity. In January of 2023, we raised approximately $1 billion in gross forward equity proceeds at a $33 price per share. Those proceeds were used throughout the year to accretively fund our transactions. We utilized our ATM program throughout 2023, raising $643 million in gross forward proceeds. That amount includes $390 million, which was raised in Q4 through the sale of 13.2 million shares via the forward and remains outstanding today. And subsequent to year-end, in Q1 2024, we sold 9.7 million shares raising $306 million in gross proceeds under our ATM via the forward. This brings our total outstanding forward equity to just under $700 million, bolstering our overall liquidity. Currently, we have approximately $3.5 billion in total liquidity comprised of $523 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2023, $696 million of proceeds under our outstanding forwards and $2.3 billion of availability under the revolving credit facility. In addition, our revolving credit facility has an accordion option, allowing us to request additional lender commitments of up to $1 billion. As we begin 2024, we believe we are extremely well positioned to navigate the current environment and do not need to raise any incremental capital as we sit here today. In terms of leverage, our total debt is currently $17.1 billion. Our net debt to fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA annualized for a full year of activity from our recent acquisitions and excluding the impact of unsettled forward equity is approximately 5.5x within our target leverage range. We have a weighted average interest rate of 4.35%, taking into account our hedge portfolio that we utilized in connection with our April 2022 inaugural investment-grade offering and a weighted average of 5.9 years to maturity. As of December 31, we've entered into a series of forward starting interest rate swap agreements ahead of our May 1 $1.05 billion bond maturity, which has an aggregate notional amount of $500 million. This portfolio has an effective treasury rate of 4.04%. Just touching on the income statement, AFFO per share was $0.55 for the quarter, an increase of 8.8% compared to $0.51 for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. For the full year 2023, AFFO per share was $2.15, an increase of 11.8% compared to $1.93 for the full year 2022 and as Ed mentioned, making VICI one of the leaders across the S&P 500 REITs. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple-net model given the increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue and our margins continue to run strong in the high 90% range when eliminating noncash items. Our G&A was $15.3 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was only 1.6%. This continues to be one of the lowest ratios in not only the triple-net sector but across all REITs. Turning to our guidance. And as you saw in our release last night, we are initiating AFFO guidance for 2024 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2024, is expected to be between $2.32 billion and $2.355 billion or between $2.22 per share and $2.25 per share. Based on the midpoint of our '24 guidance, VICI expects to deliver year-over-year AFFO per share growth of 4%, a very attractive starting point as we begin 2024. And just as a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any announced but unclosed transactions, interest income from any loans that do not yet have final draw structures, possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity, or other nonrecurring transaction or items. And as we've mentioned previously, we recorded noncash CECL allowance on a quarterly basis, which due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused, as we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments and evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends. With that, operator, please open the line for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan.', 'Anthony Paolone', ""I guess my first question is just whether or not you could put some dimensions around your deal pipeline right now, either whether it's skewed somewhere geographically, size and maybe yields?"", 'Edward Baltazar Pitoniak', ""I'll start, Tony, and good to speak with you, and then John and David can kick in. I would say that in the spirit of our opening remarks, we're obviously sober, as you've heard from other REITs in recent weeks like [Agri] and Realty Income. We're sober about the marketplace. We're sober about the capital markets, and we're pretty sober about what kind of activity may be available to us. And yet having said that, John and the team continue to work the trap lines in such a way that we have a number of conversations going on, both in gaming and nongaming that have us very excited and John can talk about that in a moment. The other point I want to emphasize, Tony, is that the magnitude of what we own brings with it opportunities you wouldn't necessarily find in other REITs, given the nature of the property they own. Especially when we look at Las Vegas, where we've got, I think, John, 40-odd thousand hotel rooms. If you look just at an asset like the Venetian, which including parking is 17 million square feet, given what's going on there, given the impact of the Sphere, the opportunity of Patrick and Nicole and team to continue to asset manage, maximize the productivity of that asset is so, so strong. I mean it's the magnitude of building, and again, this goes back to my opening remarks that we are going to continue to help the investment marketplace to understand the magnitude of the building such that there are 300,000 square feet inside the 17 million square feet that have never gone past the concrete stage, concrete floors, concrete walls, concrete ceiling, 300,000 unfinished square feet. And with the job that the team at Venetian is doing, to maximize that asset, especially taking advantage of the Sphere. That represents incremental investment opportunity or growth opportunity for us that you wouldn't likely find in most other REITs generally and certainly not in triple-net lease REITs generally, which tend to have assets of 10,000 square feet, not 17 million square feet. But John, you want to add to this?"", 'John W. R. Payne', ""Tony, you can hear from Ed's comments, he spent some time in Las Vegas recently, which I have as well. You asked a question about what sectors and I also think what locations. We obviously have been spending a lot of time in Las Vegas. We're very proud of our partners' success there, and it looks like '24 is going to be a great year as well. And as you heard from my remarks, we continue to look at different target sectors, whether in wellness and indoor water parks, pilgrimage, golf, family entertainment center, we made our first investment in youth sports which we like the mixed use of youth sports. So I continue to spend my time with my team and really the whole company looking at a variety of these and checking the boxes of which ones could make for long-term investments. And there are some sectors that we don't talk about that we've kind of checked off the list that says this is not right for our capital at this time. But we shouldn't confuse that the casino business continues to be a real focus of our company and one that we just can't be more proud of the operators and what they've done in '23 and what we see in '24."", 'Anthony Paolone', ""Okay. And then just I have one kind of detailed follow-up maybe for David, because I was asked this a couple of times overnight. Just in your guidance, like how do you -- just remind us how you're treating like the forward equity and the guidance share count like what goes in there or not?"", 'David Andrew Kieske', ""Yes. Tony, there's no implied use of proceeds or drawdown. There's a little bit of impact from treasury stock dilution in the ultimate share count, but that's the only impact."", 'Edward Baltazar Pitoniak', ""Another way of putting it, Tony, is we're not assuming any credit or horsepower from the funding, and we're taking actually a marginal penalty by virtue of having it on our -- technically, we don't have it in our balance sheet, but given the treasury stock method."", 'Operator', 'We now turn to Barry Jonas with Truist Securities.', 'Barry Jonathan Jonas', ""Guys, wanted to start with the Caesars Center call option. Can you maybe just walk through different considerations as you're thinking about exercising it and specifically timing of that?"", 'Edward Baltazar Pitoniak', ""Well, clearly, Barry, we want to be as opportunistic as we can be within our timing, given the nature -- the inherent nature of a call option. And obviously, that timing will be predicated on what our cost of funding is. And I don't think it would come as any surprise to anybody that we certainly would not choose to exercise our call option if in doing so, we were creating dilution, which we don't ever want to do. And so going back to the theme of skiing inside a milk bottle, the visibility through 2024, given its current state is such that it's hard to predict with any kind of exactitude exactly when the right time would be."", 'Barry Jonathan Jonas', ""Got it. Got it. And then, Ed, maybe just more a higher level question. You've done deals with tribes, native American tribes on commercial land before. But I was hoping you could talk more about the puts and takes with doing some type of deal structure in tribal land. There's clear risks there, but it's something banks and debt investors have been able to overcome and I think it's a sizable market with clear financing needs."", 'Edward Baltazar Pitoniak', ""Yes. I'll start, and I'll turn it over to John, Barry. I read the notes from that recent session you had, which were really interesting to read. And I know one of the participants in your session sounded rather, I won't say bullish, but seemed to say that there may be means to do it. I will tell you with complete candor, we haven't exactly figured out how that would work yet, John, right?"", 'John W. R. Payne', ""But Barry, you touched on -- we've been really excited to build relationships with 3 tribes in the commercial -- in the commercial sector. And it's something that we can continue to talk with them and other travel partners that we've gotten to know to see could there be an opportunity to help them grow on their nation's land, but we have primarily been focused with our partners on the commercial sector, and we'll continue to study that opportunity because as Ed said, we saw the study -- the report that came out as well."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs.', 'Caitlin Burrows', 'I guess you guys have made it clear that a significant part of your business could be repeat business. So can you talk about maybe the pipeline and if we should see some repeat business in 2024 and/or continue to see new operator partners pop up?', 'John W. R. Payne', ""Yes, Caitlin. Very good question you asked. No question that we continue to meet with our 13 partners currently in gaming and nongaming and talk about how our capital can help them grow over the coming years. And as Ed alluded to, the boxes that are in, I shouldn't even call them boxes in Las Vegas. The amazing resorts we owned with partners in Las Vegas could provide with a lot of opportunity in the relatively near future and in the coming years as those partners look to grow, whether that's in hotel rooms, new restaurants, new attractions. Ed mentioned, obviously, the Sphere where that sits on our land, we weren't involved in the building or they're not necessarily our direct tenant. But we see that as a pillar of growth for our company over the coming years, not only in Las Vegas, but in our regional assets because there are large regional assets, whether that's the MGM assets in National Harbor or in Detroit, there are opportunities to grow as well. And then I think your second part of the question is, are we looking to continue to expand our tenant roster? And the answer is absolutely me, my team, Ed, David, Sam, anyone else in the company is out forging new relationships to see if there's new sectors or new companies that we can use our capital to help them grow. So I wouldn't be surprised if you see some new operators or new tenants in our roster over the coming year."", 'Edward Baltazar Pitoniak', ""And Caitlin, let me just add on to that a little bit. Obviously, there have been questions understandably as to why don't you just -- why don't you just do gaming and only gaming. And as we have emphasized on many, many occasions, we are still for all the time remaining going to be intensely focused on gaming, given what a great business it is within which we own real estate. But one of the real benefits of investing in other experiential categories is, well, first of all, comes with the fact that it's just fundamentally great real estate occupied by operators who offer very rich and profitable experiences to their end customers. So that's the fundamental reason to invest in other experiential. It's fundamentally good real estate. The second dimension to that is that it gives us a test to grow when growth may not be available for gaming? And related to that, and this goes back to your initial question, Caitlin, one of the advantages we see in experiential operators like a Cabot, like a Canyon Ranch like a Bowlero like a Great Wolf, is they have network growth opportunities that are not as readily available to our gaming operators. The nature of growth in new stores and gaming is such that it is always subject to very strict regulatory control. For a Cabot, as an example, on the other hand, they have a global growth opportunity that can be seized with great energy and does not suffer the restrictions or the slowing down of cadence that tends to apply to gaming operators attempting to grow their network other than through M&A."", 'Caitlin Burrows', ""Got it. No, that makes a lot of sense. And then maybe just back to the pipeline a bit. You guys were active with both sale leasebacks and lending over the past 12 or so months despite a quiet CRE transaction market. And I know you mentioned how you're sober to the current situation, but you guys continue to invest in '23. So I was wondering if you could give some more detail on the pipeline today, maybe size, mix and how that makes you think more specifically, maybe like the first half of 24 activity could end up being or what that could be like?"", 'David Andrew Kieske', ""Caitlin, it's David. Great to hear from you. Thanks for joining us today. The nature of our capital is relationship capital and that's where we've been active both as you just mentioned, on the loan side as well as the sale-leaseback side. And it's, as John talked about in his comments, solving our partners' objectives and being a source of growth capital. And sometimes that growth capital comes in the door day 1, like you saw with our Homefield opportunity where they're building facility and going to construct at a very, very, very attractive experiential both sports and hotel assets which will lead to a sale leaseback. So it's -- we're always out talking about ways that we can help our partners grow and to kind of put it in a percentage basket of x amount of loans and x amount of sale leasebacks. That's just not how we look at it or how we kind of parse our pipeline. It's about finding the great partners that we've talked about on this call."", 'Operator', 'We now turn to Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.', 'Ravi Vijay Vaidya', ""This is Ravi Vaidya in the line for Haendel. I hope you all are doing well. I just noticed that the mezz lending and construction financing is becoming a larger proportion of our capital deployment strategy. How should we think about the sizing of that relative to your broader acquisition pipeline? And how are you underwriting those return requirements and how that's changed over the last 6 to 12 months?"", 'David Andrew Kieske', ""Ravi, it's David. Good to hear from you. I caught your question, it's how we think about kind of the spread on those mezz loans, especially around development. Look, we always -- there's a couple of ways that we look at it. And it's a little bit more art than science at the end of the day, but what's the cost of the senior -- is our senior lender ahead of us. Are we achieving the right risk-adjusted spread to the senior. Obviously, what's the duration of our capital, what's the funding cadence of our capital. Then ultimately, what most -- every lender looks at, what's the equity sponsor and how much equity is in the transaction and ensuring that we are protected from a credit standpoint at the end of the day, feel good about the project."", 'Edward Baltazar Pitoniak', ""And then to go back to the first part of your question, it will always be a minor percentage of our assets under management. And we will use it to forge relationships. We have an example, obviously, right in front of us of using lending to establish a relationship with Chelsea Piers that led to the acquisition or the primary leasehold interest in December. So we will use it both as a strategic tool to develop relationships and a strategic tool to create a steadier cadence to our capital allocation. We're very proud of the fact we got capital out the door every single month in 2023. And I can tell you, in our early years, there were whole quarters that went by where we did not get capital out the door given what was true back then, which was that the nature of our capital allocation was big and lumpy tied to big lumpy gaming acquisitions. So it is a tool that can generate growth and return on a very steady basis. It is a strategic tool to forge relationships. And again, given some of the spreads we've been able to achieve in recent years, it is very lucrative, very accretive in driving earnings growth. And again, we're about creating earnings growth that others may not be able to achieve if they're not as energetic and pioneering as we have been, both in terms of how we grow the business in terms of asset classes and through the use of our balance sheet."", 'Ravi Vijay Vaidya', ""Got it. That's very helpful. Just one more here. Can you please discuss the opportunity with the Indiana assets? In your view, how attractive is the [77 Call] in the current market? And how would you theoretically fund something like that?"", 'Edward Baltazar Pitoniak', ""Yes. Well, as I said in response to Barry, obviously, [77] is not as attractive as when it was struck a few years back when the call agreement was struck a few years back. And it will be a call opportunity we will be excited about executing if it's an accretive opportunity, and it is not an accretive opportunity. It's in fact, there would be a dilutive opportunity at 77 , we would not do it."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Chris Darling with Green Street.', 'Chris Darling', ""Just going back to the Caesars call options, again, let's just for argument's sake, assume that you do exercise those options. I'm just curious, how would you think about the deal structure from a rent standpoint? So I'm wondering, would you possibly structure tighter rent coverage on a stand-alone basis if it made sense within kind of the larger master lease?"", 'Edward Baltazar Pitoniak', 'Well, yes, Chris. So the rent coverage by virtue of the current call agreement is set but we -- it is a subject of discussion and one we have and would like to continue to explore with Caesars, such that on an overall basis, they and we are at rent coverages that everybody feels really good about for decades to come.', 'Chris Darling', ""All right. Fair enough. One more for you, just touching on the Homefield agreement. Just hoping you can elaborate on the scope of the project, potential future expansion. So I'm wondering what the total estimated investment is for the current development, how the team is thinking about scaling to additional locations over time? And just trying to wrap my arms around what the scope of investment might look like for VICI over time."", 'John W. R. Payne', ""Yes, Chris, it's John. When we made the announcement a few months ago, we talked about spending a couple of years studying the youth sports business. And we learned a lot in that process. We've also found an amazing partner in Homefield. We announced our first opportunity with them in the Kansas City area and they're building not only the youth sports facility but connected to a Margaritaville resorts. That's one of the things that I think you'll continue to see is if we place other investments into the youth sports spaces, having numerous cash registers, not just having the fields to rent or the stadiums to rent, but also having connected to 1 operator who controls the restaurants who controls the hotel rooms and controls the sports fields. So this is a $110 million-ish initial investment with Homefield. We've not announced any further development, not only on that site, which does have opportunity to expand over time, but also other sites around the Midwest or the United States. But as with any partner that we've talked about, whether that's with casino partners or with Cabot or Canyon Ranch and now Homefield, we hope that it's not just our only investment with them, and we purposely took so much time to study the business to find the right partner to grow."", 'Operator', 'We now turn to Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank.', 'Greg Michael McGinniss', 'So as we continue to invest in nongaming assets, how should investors get comfortable with more opaque kind of financials there? And what sort of premium are you receiving from an investment yield standpoint as it compares to a potential gaming investment?', 'Edward Baltazar Pitoniak', ""Yes. So you are right, Greg, if we're if we're partnering with an experiential operator that's not public, the tenant financials are not crystal clear in the same way, they're not crystal clear across a whole lot of net lease portfolios. And at the end of the day, we obviously have to exercise our fiduciary responsibility to the greatest degree possible in ensuring that the fundamental business is very, very supportive of the rent and the way in which our operating partners manage their balance sheets and liquidity is also a strength that ensures that they won't be in positions where they're unable to meet the rent. We've got a very rigorous underwriting practice. We obviously can take advantage of history in many of the categories, experiential categories that we're investing in. And again, at the end of the day, it's up to us to make sure that they are of a strength that's going to enable them to weather whatever should come their way. But I will also emphasize that our key criteria, our first and forth criteria in evaluating all investments gaming and experiential widely is that the businesses be of lower-than-average cyclicality versus consumer discretionary at large, which we think is another risk mitigant when it comes to ensuring that they can cover the rent through thick and thin."", 'Greg Michael McGinniss', ""Just to follow up on that. In the cases where you're providing construction loans -- there's not kind of in-place cash flows to be underwriting or evaluating, what's the process look like there when you're trying to get comfortable in terms of lending that money and the ability to recollect in the case that maybe cash flows don't hit quite the targets that were expected?"", 'Edward Baltazar Pitoniak', ""Well, last dollar exposure is obviously one of the key criteria and ensuring that our last dollar exposure is at a level whereby if we did end up owning the asset, that the operating economics are such that at the last dollar exposure level that we would be lending at, we're still in good shape."", 'John W. R. Payne', ""Yes, Greg, and then it comes down to, as I mentioned, quality of the sponsor, the kind of equity. So overall, loan to cost, loan to value and then the protections that are obviously ultimately documented in our agreements. But a lot of the sectors like our sale-leaseback investments, we study the sectors. Indoor water parks, we studied for 18-odd months led by certain members of our team and went deep into that sector before we did anything. And so it's gaining conviction whether it be through direct real estate ownership or the lending platform that we have of who the operator is, the durability of the sector and then the ultimate protections that we can put in place."", 'Greg Michael McGinniss', ""Okay. And just a final one from me. I'd like to preface this question by acknowledging the great work that John and his team has done so far. And we know that you've added some great members to the investment team as well. But given your sector low G&A, how do you balance that shareholder-friendly expense line versus investing in a larger acquisitions team that could maybe help source and underwrite more investment opportunities?"", 'Edward Baltazar Pitoniak', ""No, it's a very strategic question, Greg. And it's a question we regularly wrestle with. I would say one of the ways in which we deal with, if you will, the underinvestment risk in G&A is by, I think, having forged some of the strongest partnership relationships of anybody out there. From day 1, we have treated our advisers as best as we possibly can. This means the investment banks, the other parties, the real estate advisory firms such that we are always the first they call when they think there's a compelling opportunity. They are a force multiplier for us. And we have great respect for them. We engage with them intensely. We reward them when they do great work for us. And in the event we end up saving on G&A, which in an inflationary period has really 2 benefits. Overall, low G&A to begin with and less inflationary impact on our G&A load. If it ever gets to the point where we feel we're shortchanging shareholders by running too thin, we will certainly add resources in the way we've obviously added resources here in the last couple of years."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Nick Joseph with Citi.', 'Nicholas Gregory Joseph', ""I wanted to get your kind of commentary or thoughts on performance thus far (inaudible). It seems like mainstream media has been favorable on it, but there's also good local articles on some management changes there. Just wondering how performance is there?"", 'John W. R. Payne', 'Nick, I won\'t necessarily talk about the financial performance, but what I will make a comment about is what a beautiful asset that was built by the team there, the Koch Industries, the Fontainebleau team, the operating team there that I haven\'t met anyone that walks through the place and says, ""Oh, this is a miss."" I think most people walk through the place and say, ""Wow, what an amazing place."" And I think for those of us who have spent time operating in Las Vegas over the years, it takes time. It takes time to build up a database and it takes time, but they sure do have a facility that I think everyone is proud of and we sure are proud of.', 'Edward Baltazar Pitoniak', 'And Nick, you\'ve given me the opportunity to vent a little bit about how utterly weary I am around the negativity of so much of the media coverage, which regularly gets proven to be way overly negative. Oh my God, The Sphere is going to be a disaster. I was in the U.K. earlier this week. I was struck by how many people wanted to talk about The Sphere because they\'ve either already been or they\'re determined to go. And again, media coverage around that? Oh my God. ""oh, F1 is going to be a disaster."" Well, guess what, it wasn\'t. The drivers love it. The teams loved it. It was an amazing weekend of business for our operating partners. So Super Bowl. again, just a phenomenal event for Las Vegas and for the NFL. So I absolutely agree with you. Some of the press coverage has been quite negative. But we know the people involved. We know how hard they\'re working. We know how challenging what it is that they\'ve set forth for themselves to open an unaffiliated property on the strip. And yet again, that asset is utterly magnificent and they\'re doing the right things to bring business to it over time. And with the backing of Koch, you can be sure that the backing is strong enough that they have the patience but more over the firepower to make this work in due course.', 'Nicholas Gregory Joseph', ""That's very helpful. And then just -- I know we've talked a lot on the pipeline and investment opportunities, kind of the more sober environment out there. But if I just think about kind of the stickiness of cap rates, I mean, where are you seeing the most at least pricing power expansion where probably makes a little more sense in today's environment versus I would imagine some others where it's a bit stickier?"", 'Edward Baltazar Pitoniak', 'Are you talking about cap rate variability across various experiential asset classes?', 'Nicholas Gregory Joseph', 'Exactly.', 'Edward Baltazar Pitoniak', ""Yes. I don't know, John and David, I don't know that we've seen a tremendous amount of variability across asset classes. We're obviously not seeing a tremendous amount of trading and yet you obviously saw with our unlevered 7.7% yield for the $1.8 billion we put out the door in 2023 that we have obviously been able to acquire income at higher yields. I would have a tough time generalizing, but David and John, I don't know if you want to add."", 'David Andrew Kieske', ""Yes. I would -- think you covered it well, but Nick, I mean, it's no different than any other asset class that you're -- in terms of the broader net lease. You just -- you bid out spreads and buyers, obviously willing -- or sorry, sellers' willingness to transact around -- in a backdrop where there's the volatility and variability that we've talked about. And so there's opportunity out there, but it's a difference in the broader CRE market. It's somewhat of a bit of a quieter environment and just an air of caution -- cautious on both sides until we're going to figure out where the tenure is going, where the broader economy is going."", 'Operator', 'We now turn to Jim Kammert with Evercore ISI.', 'James Hall Kammert', ""Obviously, VICI is going to remain very much a gaming-focused investing in operating company. But you mentioned that you've vetted thoroughly some sort of other verticals, didn't pan out, which is all logical. But could you quantify do you think that your total addressable market or investment opportunity set for new potential verticals continue to expand, just tying to figure out if you're overall catch basin is sort of winnowing or widening?"", 'John W. R. Payne', ""Yes, it is definitely widening. As there are a few that were saying, hey, we ultimately -- not right for us today. There's other opportunities that come about that we study and learn who the operators are, we learn where their locations are, we spend time with them. So no question, the funnel is getting wider."", 'Edward Baltazar Pitoniak', ""Yes. And I'll give you an example of that, Jim. When you really begin to know a category, as David has spoken of. As you get to know the -- if you will, the water experience category, which we first invested in through Great Wolf, what's really been remarkable over the last few years is the way in which really creative innovative operators are taking water experiences and continuing to innovate around them, not simply for kids losing their minds and spending their parents' money at Great Wolf, but also water experiences that are more focused on an adult crowd. And that's really exciting to witness because of the growth opportunities it represents within the category and across multiple geographies."", 'James Hall Kammert', ""Great. And one small item. It's been in the press that there is some tax dispute underway at MGM National Harbor. It's obviously an important asset for VICI. But would that -- have any details around that?

And probably a question for the -- our great partner Hard Rock on timing. But I think they've, as you've probably been following the story, they acquired the operations of the Mirage a little over a year ago from MGM that has been operating, but have also been out getting approvals and designing the opportunity to change the facility from the Mirage to the Hard Rock Las Vegas. As it pertains to timing and budget and construction and that it's probably something that they'll lead that charge. But we, of course, as the owner of the property are excited to watch that asset, get repositioned over time. It's obviously an amazing asset for a long period of time. But I think everyone would think of a Hard Rock Las Vegas would do great on that site."", 'Wesley Keith Golladay', 'And then maybe just 1 on the financing front. You do have the $1 billion churn this year. You have the $500 million of swaps. Are you looking at doing an unsecured to take those out? Or maybe a mix of term loans and unsecured, how are you thinking about that?', 'David Andrew Kieske', ""Yes, Wes, it's David. We will focus on continuing to access the unsecured market and extend our maturity tenure and increase the overall size of our investment-grade basket, those are legacy MGP high-yield notes.

Well, obviously, we're looking at a period over the last couple of years in which conventional bank financing has definitely diminished as a source of funding for experiential place makers and operators. And at the same time, obviously, you've seen the upsurge of private credit, of which we are part. And I would say that in many cases, we are being invited into the funding opportunity because of our track record in experiential. And the endorsement that our underwriting process brings to a project that we choose to be involved in. We obviously look at them really rigorously. And we, again, I would say we get invited in a lot to processes as opposed to having to scour the landscape and throw our hats in the ring."", 'Daniel Edward Guglielmo', 'Great. And then you all have such tremendous growth with some pretty big deals over the last few years.

R. Payne', ""Dan, nice to talk to you this morning. I'll just go back to our assets in Las Vegas, and I don't know how you're describing big hitter, but if there are opportunities for us to continue to invest in assets that we already own and help the operator grow with accretive new projects. I'll consider that being big, big hitting because I'm not sure there's a better place in the world to invest in right now than Las Vegas. Obviously, we've got a portfolio there. but there are some amazing assets Ed referred to, the Venetian that has a lot of footprint to continue to be developed."", 'Edward Baltazar Pitoniak', ""And I think, John, we can add in, obviously, the MGM property in Yonkers should they be granted a full gaming license.

Or would you be willing to take kind of a larger bite into either the real estate or debt and then new asset types in a much bigger way, say, over $1 billion?', 'Edward Baltazar Pitoniak', ""Boy, that would be a pretty big number, Jay. But the check sizes you're referring to they may look small in relation to our overall scale. But I would tell you, in returns, they're pretty big checks. These are not small assets and they're certainly not small in economic productivity. And so if we can do $50 million to $100 million and up loans on assets that we either have a direct path to ownership on or a potential path to ownership on, you add those up and you can get to $1 billion in aggregate. But obviously, by not having it all in one single investment, we are obviously spreading out our risk and amplifying our opportunities to develop new relationships."", 'Jay Bradley Kornreich', ""Okay. I appreciate that. And then just a quick follow-up on, I guess, the leverage. You're now at 5.5x, which is in your 5 to 5.5x range. So should we expect new transactions to be funded I guess, with incrementally more debt capital at this point? Or do you intend to continue to over-equitize new deals and now get that leverage further down?"", 'David Andrew Kieske', ""Jay, it's David. We will continue to migrate our leverage down. We're obviously within our target range just we kept everybody post MGP, we take leverage up to 5x.

I would say, John, it's professional sports, it's obviously the emergence of the Sphere. It's the overall growth of Las Vegas and we obviously have the vacant land. But probably even more valuable is the land we already own. You referred to the triangle formed by A Stadium, T-Mobile and Allegiant. We own everything inside that triangle, MGM operates everything inside that angle. If you think about where the A Stadium is going to go, we own 3 of those 4 corners; in MGM Grand, Excalibur and New York, New York. I know MGM is very excited about the repositioning opportunities at those 4 corners, and it applies to so many of the other assets that we own up and down the strip as well as you say, that vacant land. I just can't, again, emphasize enough how incredibly valuable it is to have the position we have in Las Vegas because Las Vegas is reaching a global critical mass that really no other place on earth right now rivals, not Orlando, not Macau, the way things have evolved there.

As the largest resort operator on the Las Vegas Strip, MGM boasts a portfolio of iconic properties that contribute significantly to its revenue streams. The filing indicates that the Strip accounted for approximately 74% of total EBITDAR in 2022, while U.S. regional assets represented 31%. Despite a negative EBITDAR from Macao in 2022, MGM's U.S. sports and iGaming operations are a growing segment, contributing a high-single-digit percentage of total revenue. With an aggregate market value of $12.3 billion as of June 30, 2023, and a strategic focus on an asset-light model, MGM is poised to leverage its strengths and navigate its weaknesses in the dynamic hospitality and gaming industry."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with MGM.', ""Market Dominance and Brand Equity: MGM Resorts International's stronghold on the Las Vegas Strip is a testament to its brand equity and market dominance. With approximately one-fourth of all units in the market, MGM's properties such as MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay, and Bellagio serve as landmarks of luxury and entertainment. This dominance provides a competitive edge in attracting a high volume of visitors and maintaining a significant market share. The brand's reputation for quality and luxury bolsters customer loyalty and allows for premium pricing, contributing to a robust revenue stream that is evident in the 74% contribution to total EBITDAR from the Strip."", ""Digital and International Expansion: MGM's strategic investments in digital capabilities and international markets are pivotal strengths. The acquisition of LeoVegas and the 50% ownership in BetMGM, LLC highlight MGM's commitment to expanding its online gaming footprint. These digital ventures not only diversify MGM's revenue sources but also position the company to capitalize on the growing online gaming and sports betting markets. Furthermore, the anticipated resort opening in Japan by 2030 and the controlling interest in MGM China underscore the company's international ambitions, which can lead to increased global presence and revenue diversification."", ""Market Concentration Risks: While MGM's dominance in Las Vegas is a strength, it also presents a weakness in the form of market concentration risk. With the Strip contributing a significant portion of the company's EBITDAR, MGM is vulnerable to economic downturns, shifts in tourism patterns, and specific regional events that could adversely affect the Las Vegas market. This concentration may limit MGM's ability to mitigate risks through geographic diversification and could impact the company's financial stability in the face of localized challenges."", ""Debt Management: MGM's strategic initiatives, including its asset-light model and capital investments, require substantial financial resources. The company's approach to funding these initiatives has led to a considerable level of debt. Effective management of this debt is crucial to maintaining financial health and ensuring the company can continue to invest in growth opportunities. The balance sheet must be carefully managed to optimize the debt structure and minimize interest expenses, which can otherwise erode profitability and financial flexibility."", 'Growth in Online Gaming: The burgeoning online gaming and sports betting sector presents a significant opportunity for MGM. With its investments in BetMGM and LeoVegas, MGM is well-positioned to capture a larger share of this market. The integration of MGM Rewards with BetMGM and the expansion of the BetMGM brand into the UK market are strategic moves that can drive customer acquisition and retention. As online gaming continues to gain legal and social acceptance, MGM can leverage its brand and digital platforms to scale its online operations and generate new revenue streams.', ""International Market Expansion: MGM's planned resort in Japan and its controlling interest in MGM China offer avenues for international growth. The opening of the new property on the Cotai Strip and the potential resort in Japan represent opportunities to tap into the lucrative Asian gaming and hospitality markets. These ventures can provide MGM with a foothold in regions with high growth potential, allowing the company to diversify its revenue sources and reduce dependence on the domestic market."", ""Competitive Pressures: The gaming and hospitality industries are highly competitive, with numerous players vying for market share. MGM faces competition from other resort operators in Las Vegas, regional gaming markets, and international destinations. The emergence of new entrants and the expansion of existing competitors can erode MGM's market position and pressure the company to continuously innovate and invest in its properties to maintain its competitive edge."", 'Regulatory Risks: MGM operates in a heavily regulated industry, and changes in gaming and hospitality regulations can pose significant threats. Regulatory shifts can impact operational costs, market access, and the legal landscape for online gaming and sports betting. MGM must navigate these complexities and adapt to regulatory changes to avoid penalties, maintain compliance, and capitalize on new market opportunities.', ""In conclusion, MGM Resorts International's SWOT analysis reveals a company with strong market presence and brand equity, bolstered by strategic digital and international expansions. However, it must navigate weaknesses such as market concentration risks and debt management. Opportunities in online gaming and international markets are promising, while competitive pressures and regulatory risks pose ongoing threats. By leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses, MGM can capitalize on growth opportunities and mitigate threats, positioning itself for continued success in the global gaming and hospitality landscape."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

On the other hand, customers tend to cut down their expenditures when it comes to consumer discretionary items when adverse macroeconomic situations persist.', 'The consumer staples sector faced challenges in the past year as the companies had to face rising inflation as well as increasing competition from private-label companies in the sector.

Morgan Stanley faces intense competition from banks, investment firms, fintech companies, and other financial service providers.

(NYSE:CRM) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more."", 'While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.', ' See our latest analysis for Salesforce ', ""Over the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Co-Founder, Marc Benioff, for US$132m worth of shares, at about US$267 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$293, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign.

I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Salesforce insiders own about US$7.9b worth of shares (which is 2.8% of the company).

Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision."", 'Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR', 'Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.', 'The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', 'Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.', 'In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.', 'Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.', ""Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements."", 'Should You Invest in CRM?', 'Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Salesforce.com, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $8.20.', ""Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term."", ""The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Salesforce.com.

Former Chairman of LVMH North America Pauline Brown — LVMH (MC.PA) owns high-end brands like Christian Dior, Louis Vuitton, and Marc Jacobs — sits down with Yahoo Finance Live to discuss factors accelerating spending from select segments of luxury consumers.', '""The reality is there is some shift going on in terms of experiences versus goods, and what is a really interesting trend which I\'m going to continue to watch are the bigger luxury brands going into hospitality. For example, Vuitton will be opening its first-ever hotel in Paris — Vuitton Hotel,"" Brown says.', 'She goes on to comment on bifurcation from Chinese customers stemming from the overall quality of brands.', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan."", ""JOSH LIPTON: How much, Pauline, do you think, you know, kind of the momentum we're seeing here with the luxury shopper, how much would you pay on that in the stock market?"", ""PAULINE BROWN: Some, some, not a direct correlation. There are definitely segments of luxury spenders, high net worth-- ultra high net worth whose net worth is very tied up in stocks. And when they're feeling confident, when they have events and travel and all the things that go with the stock market, they spend."", ""But most of the growth of the last decade or two has come from aspirational consumers. And I'd say the housing market, jobs, other factors have more played into whether they're in the mood to go shopping. And they are, by the way, they are shopping."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. It seems like, I mean, it's also interesting if you look at the trend that we have seen among middle income shoppers to do stuff instead of buy stuff, right, over the past year. How is that playing out with the luxury shopper? Are they just doing both?"", 'PAULINE BROWN: Well, some of it is-- when you do stuff and you are visible, you also--', 'JULIE HYMAN: You have to look good.', ""PAULINE BROWN: You have to look good. So there's always a bit of a compulsion to buy stuff to look good while you're doing stuff, so that certainly plays out for travel and for weddings and other big occasions, even for going out to dinner. The reality is there is some shift going on in terms of experiences versus goods. And what is a really interesting trend, which I'm going to continue to watch, are the bigger luxury brands going into hospitality."", ""So for example, Vuitton will be opening its first ever hotel in Paris, Vuitton Hotel. RH, another business, home furnishings based here in the US, they opened a very successful restaurant starting with the one here in the meatpacking district. Dior, Christian Dior has a patisserie, a cafe, in their French flagship. So I think you're going to see that. I don't think those initiatives make money. I don't think they're very profitable. But I think they bring people into the store."", 'JOSH LIPTON: Another big topic, Pauline, we talk a lot about on this show is China. What are the trends there with regard to luxury shopping?', ""PAULINE BROWN: A few things. First of all, they're much more discriminating now than they were five or 10 years ago. So as I said before, there's a bifurcation between high-performing luxury brands and the rest. I think the Chinese have shown a level of sophistication that is playing into that as well."", ""Secondly, they're not spending while they travel to the same extent that they did. So they're spending a lot more at home. They are traveling. They're not traveling to the US or Europe in the same numbers, but they're going to Korea and to Japan. But they've become accustomed to shopping locally. So where they're buying has shifted."", 'And here in the US, if you speak to any of the local luxury general managers, they saw a huge drop off in Chinese shoppers visiting the US for that very reason.', ""JULIE HYMAN: To just drill down, again, into that bifurcation that you alluded to, is it just a matter-- is it a matter of execution? Is it a matter of creativity in terms of offering what people want between the ones that are doing well and the ones that are not doing as well? What's the distinction?"", 'PAULINE BROWN: Well, yes and yes. It is both of those. What I would say is you take a gold standard like Hermes. Yes, they execute well. And yes, they have first rate creativity and artistry and craftsmanship. But they also have, I think, managed this very delicate balance between heritage and modernity. So how do I stay true to what I have always stood for, and how do I continue to create new desirability and feel relevant to the times we live in?', ""Many of the luxury brands, particularly the younger ones, I think have gone way too heavily into the trend, into the contemporary, into digital marketing. And I think in the process, they've lost their roots, they've lost authenticity. And they also have overexpanded in an effort to be so commercial. Whereas, Hermes has been very, very disciplined in not overexpanding. If they wanted to double their business tomorrow, they could. But they know that if they want to be around in a hundred years from now, they better restrain that growth level.""]"

This morning we reported full year core earnings of $1.23 delivering at the high end of our annual guidance range. This result represents growth of 12% over our 2022 results of $1.10. In the fourth quarter we recognized the full year benefit of our 2023 general rate case as expected. I’m also pleased to announce that we exceeded our 2% annual nonfuel O&M savings target for the second consecutive year with savings coming in at 5.5% and pushing our EPS to the high end of the range. Because these savings were predominantly generated by reducing waste and improving service, they benefit customers today and benefit investors for years to come.

In addition, I'm pleased to share that we're extending our core EPS growth guidance of at least 9% for an additional two years through 2028. Our needed customer investment leads to strong rate-based growth, which continues to be the primary driver of our future earnings growth.

The list in 2023 reflects our 5.5% non-fuel O&M reduction well above our 2% plan. Slide five is a reminder of the key elements of our simple, affordable model, which allows us to continue growing customer capital investment at 9% or more while containing customer bill increases at or below assumed inflation in the 2% to 4% range. Key enablers in the model are ongoing annual non-fuel O&M reductions of 2%, efficient financing, and electric low growth in the 1% to 3% range."", 'The proof is in the numbers.

Our new ROE of 10.7% took effect on January 1st this year, with collections beginning this month in gas rates and next month for electric. Delivering on this projected 2% to 4% bill growth trajectory is an essential element of the PG&E plan, and one which will be important for building trust with our customers over the long run. For our average gas and electric residential customer, average monthly bill increases are limited to the 2% to 4% range from 2023 through 2026. I wanted to be clear that this includes the step up in 2024 as we implement the GRC and other deferred cost recoveries.', ""Our plan shows average bills stepping down, beginning later this year and further in both 2025 and 2026, keeping the average annual increase in the lower half of the 2% to 4% range as catch-up recoveries roll off. Two of the larger items are around $1 billion of 2022 WMCE interim rate relief, which comes off bills in mid-2024, and the 24-month collection of our first-year GRC revenues, which come off at the start of 2026. Let me say that again. Based on what we know today, our bills will rise at the lower half of the range, around 2.5% per year on average for the duration of this rate case from 2023 through 2026. Let's shift gears to the significant progress the team has made on risk mitigation. Slide seven updates our 2023 admission data for the full year."", ""Total CPUC reportable admissions came in at 65% for 2023, down 68% from the 2017 baseline, and 29% down from 2022. On the right side of the slide, we're showing our weather normalized ignition rate, which is a metric from our wildfire mitigation plan. This year's number of 0.93 was a reduction of 71% from 2017, and our lowest annual number since we began calculating this metric. The metric demonstrates that we continue to drive down wildfire risk in 2023, even after adjusting for fewer circuit mile days under our three or higher conditions when the risks of catastrophic wildfire are highest. While we're extremely pleased with these results, our team certainly isn't stopping here. We see further opportunities to drive overall wildfire risk reduction beyond the 94% achieved in 2023, as we continue with additional system hardening and deployment of new technologies."", 'In addition to the physical risk reduction, financial risks are also lower, including key protections under AB 1054, which were reaffirmed with the issuance of our annual safety certificate last month. Looking forward, here on Slide eight, we want to take a moment to highlight how we see PG&E offering investors a truly differentiated, high-quality utility growth story. This starts with premium rate-based growth and industry leading 9.5%. What sets us apart is our commitment to make this investment affordable for our customers. The key enabler is our ability to drive consistent non-fuel O&M savings as we deploy our lane operating system in a utility, which previously saw cost compound at an annual 10% rate over the prior five years. As a reminder, several years of doing whatever was necessary to respond to back-to-back crisis pushed our capital-to-expense ratio far below the industry average.', ""This is where we have a wealth of opportunity and a long runway to drive efficiencies with sustainable savings benefiting both our customers and our investors. We expect future load growth related to California's leadership and electrification to be a further differentiator and one which will help keep customer build growth within our 2% to 4% forecast. In addition to continued adoption of electric vehicles throughout our service territory, we have seen a three-fold increase in data center applications in 2023 versus the prior four years. We plan to speak more about these load growth trends over the course of this year, including at an investor meeting which we are planning for June 12th in New York, so please mark your calendars for that. The fundamental differentiators of rate-based growth, O&M savings, and load growth, we would add our constructive state regulatory and policy environment in California."", ""Key elements of the California regulatory model include four years of revenue certainty under the GRC, returns which are set separately from the GRC including a formulaic adjustment mechanism, and timely recovery for pass-through of important cost categories including fuel and pension. With our GRC resolved, we now have revenue certainty extended through 2026, giving us the best level of regulatory visibility we've had since I joined PG&E and something which any regulated utility would love. This brings me to our performance playbook, including our lean operating system, which is becoming a critical differentiator for PG&E as we continue building a sustainable culture based on continuous improvement and what we refer to as breakthrough thinking."", 'And so, on slide nine, to my story of the month, or in this case, the story of the year. Let me first take you back to the beginning of 2023. We had a goal to underground 350 miles of electric lines at a unit cost of $3.3 million per mile. We started 2023 with only about five miles of civil construction fully complete. At that point, we had hundreds of miles still to design, thousands of individual easements to negotiate, 345 miles of trenches to dig, and 350 miles of cable to pull. And then, the winter storms hit. 15 atmospheric rivers to be exact, which brought civil work to a near standstill through April. So, how did we deliver on 2023 undergrounding plan? As scoped, on time, and at better than targeted unit cost performance? Well, during a visit with our board of directors in December, I watched proudly as the undergrounding team described how they use the PG&E performance playbook every day and at every level.', ""What they shared wasn't one silver bullet, not just a breakthrough idea or a value stream map or a waste elimination. Rather, it was this team's commitment to living the culture, using the tools, and building the capabilities that enabled our results and which will cause future success. In 2023 alone, the undergrounding team eliminated $68 million in waste for the benefit of our customers. They did this by updating our standards, deploying optimal construction methods, and better managing spoils. With additional improvements, average unit cost came in below our target of $3.3 million to just under $3 million per mile. And the average construction cycle time improved from five and a half months back in February 2023 to three and a half months today."", 'This was a total game changer in meeting and exceeding our 350 mile goals. Thanks to our 2023 undergrounding efforts, we can avoid proactively turning off power to about 15,000 households during dangerous high wind events. These customers who live in our highest risk areas can now sleep at night knowing they do not have to trade safety for reliability or worry that a tree might land on the power line in their backyard. This is climate resilient infrastructure for all weather conditions and for generations to come. The team reminded us that before lean we would have managed the underground efforts through spreadsheets and phone calls. That was the old PG&E way. Undergrounding team is showing us the new PG&E. Imagine the impact our performance playbook can have enterprise-wide.', ""It's great that we achieved our 2023 goals. What's even better is that we've created a playbook enabling consistent premium performance year-end and year-out. As I like to say, performance is power. This means delivering safe, affordable and reliable service to our hometowns along with consistent predictable financial results. With that, let me turn it over to Carolyn."", ""Carolyn Burke: Thank you Patti and good morning everyone. Today I'm excited to cover three topics with you. First, a recap of our 2023 results. Second, our differentiated growth opportunities. And third, how are we making this growth affordable for our customers by executing on our simple, affordable model? Starting here on slide 10, I'm pleased to report that we met or exceeded all of our 2023 goals, both operational and financial. And we're on track for each of our longer-term commitments. Our 2023 report card is another proof point that our performance playbook is working. The culture and capabilities we are building here at PG&E are enabling our delivery of consistent, predictable results. It's a virtue to recycle, setting industry-leading targets, using our lean operating system to manage the day-to-day work, and then delivering on our promises, building trust with our customers and our investors."", ""This is how we've made our system safer, faster. It's how we deliver it on our 2022 and 2023 EPS guidance. And it's how we can further strengthen our balance sheet while keeping bills affordable for our customers. I'm especially proud that we reduce non-fuel operating and maintenance costs by 5.5% in 2023. That's in addition to fully observing inflation and on top of the 3% we achieved in 2022. Looking forward, we see no shortage of opportunities to continue delivering better outcomes for customers at a lower cost all across the business. I'd note that not all of the 2023 reduction hit the bottom line, with the majority directly benefiting customers, including our self-insurance solution and substantial efficiencies in our vegetation management work."", ""Our mid-teens by 2024 FFO to debt target is on track, and there is no change to our plan to reduce parent company debt by at least $2 billion by the end of 2026. We remain firmly committed to achieving solid investment grade ratings. In December, we were pleased to see S&P revised their rating outlook from stable to positive, indicating the potential for an upgrade in the next 12 months. And earlier this week, I'm delighted to say that Moody's upgraded our rating by one notch, also leaving us some positive outlook. This puts us one notch away from investment grade, one step closer to our goal. We value the support we receive from our regulators, helping us strengthen our balance sheet while we execute our plan to affordably serve customers and investors."", 'For example, on February 1st, the Commission issued a proposed decision authorizing interim rate relief in the amount of $516 million, while our wildfire and gas safety cost application is pending. The interim relief may be voted on as early as March 7th, and would provide for collections to start as soon as practical over a 12-month period. Moving to slide 11, as you can see here, and as expected, the largest discrete driver of fourth quarter and full-year results was the approval of our 2023 general rate case, which added $0.15. We also saw a benefit of $0.03, partly attributed to our non-fuel O&M savings, including better resource management and improved planning and execution. Please recall that our O&M savings are part of our simple, affordable model, which allows us to complete more work for the benefit of our customers while delivering affordability.', ""That's exactly what you see here with $0.05 of redeployment. Our savings allowed us to stand up 10 additional model yards, designed to improve frontline productivity with more efficient processes, minimizing rework, and eliminating waste as we deliver for our customers. We also provided additional training resources for our co-workers, and we accelerated inspections, calling forward work to protect 2024, and ensuring we're doing the highest priority work for our customers. We use every extra resource to better serve our customers and achieve our commitments to you, our investors. We weather the ups and downs to deliver consistent predictable results. As Patti highlighted, we ended 2023 at the top of our EPS guidance range, although our core philosophy remains to redeploy excess earnings back into the system, benefiting customers while de-risking and extending premium growth on behalf of investors."", 'On slide 12, we are extending our CapEx and rate-based growth projections another year to include 2028, showing a five-year annual rate-based growth of 9.5%. Our new five-year capital plan represents an increase of over $10 billion, or approximately 20% over the 2023 to 2027 plan. This also is over 45% higher than the previous five-year period from 2019 to 2023. The amounts shown on this slide reflect our base capital plan, including how much our rate-based is already approved by regulators. The vast majority, or 93%, of our rate-based for this year is already authorized, as is 90% of our 2026 forecast. In addition to our plan, there are substantial needs to do more. Specifically, we have at least an incremental $5 billion of CapEx opportunities, which we will seek to fold into our plan while still meeting our affordability commitments.', ""These include capacity investments and transmission upgrades to support continued system-wide growth. As we work to drive affordability under our simple affordable model and ongoing deployment of lean, we will look for opportunities to add this important work. As you know, this capital investment fuels both earnings growth and improves our operating cash flow, as illustrated on slide 13, which we have updated and extended since we first showed it at last year's investor day. As shown, we're projecting substantial improvement in our operating cash flow in 2024, partly as a result of the final GRC decision. Operating cash flow grows from $5 billion in 2023 to $11 billion by 2028, providing resources to grow our capital investment for customers from $9.8 billion in 2023 to $14 billion in 2028, and substantially improving our cash flow before dividends."", 'As Patti mentioned, our guidance includes no new equity in 2024. As we look forward, we have many good efficient financing choices, including close to $2.5 billion of annual retained earnings today and rising from there at our present low level of dividend payout. Half of our funding provided from normal utility debt, substantial levels of prior cost recovery, favorable tax conditions, poor working capital improvements, the sale of a minority interest in our non-nuclear generation assets, and potentially reintroducing an at-the-market or ATM equity program in 2025. While we are not giving the final mix of our 2025 financing plan today, rest assured that our plan only includes choices which are accretive to our guidance. In light of this, we are extending our core EPS growth rate of at least 9% through 2027 and 2028.', ""Moving to slide 14, this is our simple affordable model and a breakdown of the 5.5% O&M savings last year. Patti shared details about our undergrounding achievements in 2023, and there are many more similar stories throughout the business. I’ll share just one more with you today. At our investor day, you heard about improvements we were making to the new customer connections process by leveraging our performance playbook. Now, here's how we ended the year. The team was able to save $24 million while decreasing average end-to-end lead time by 13%. That's a 50-day reduction. We also reduced engineering design time by 33%, a 37-day reduction. As a result, customer on-time delivery improved by 25 percentage points. I share this example to make an important point."", ""This is not a cost-cutting program at PG&E. Rather, this is about good business decisions, which are sustainable for the long-term, and it's about using the performance playbook, including the Lean operating system, to improve how we do our work every day. Our actions are improving the customer experience and making capital and safety investments affordable. I'll end here on slide 15 with regulatory catalysts on the horizon in 2024. As you can see, they are still plentiful and include resolution of our proposed PacGen sale, a proposed decision in Phase 2 of our GRC, implementing Senate Bill 410 and unlocking our potential to meet the new customer demand here in California, filing of our 10-year undergrounding plan, and bringing our $5 billion of incremental capital opportunities into the plan while still meeting our affordability goals."", ""Finally, I'll comment on our cost of capital adjustment advice letter, which was approved by Commission staff in December, raising our allowed ROE from 10% to 10.7% and truing up our cost of debt. While this adjustment is already approved and in customer rates starting this month, in January, a joint intervener group filed a late request for review of staff's approval. While we recognize this creates some uncertainty for investors, we were pleased that the Commission staff upheld operation of the adjustment mechanism in December as intended. Intervenors offered no new fundamental arguments in their request for review, and we look forward to this issue being resolved expeditiously. In the meantime, as we have said consistently, our EPS growth guidance is not dependent on the outcome, and we value the opportunity to redeploy the revenue uplift for the benefit of customers while delivering consistent, predictable results for investors."", ""There's a lot to look forward to in 2024 and beyond. Including our 10% core EPS growth guidance and our at least 9% growth rate now extended through 2028. With that, I'll hand it back to Patti."", ""Patricia Poppe: Thank you, Carolyn. Before we take your questions, let me introduce our new report card here on slide 16, against which you'll be able to track our record of differentiated performance. We're showing our results for 2022 and 2023, along with our goals for 2024 and beyond. We believe, we have a differentiated plan and the right team in place to deliver on these objectives. As I said earlier, performance is power, and we have significant operational momentum with a healthy set of catalysts in front of us. The PG&E turnaround is on track. We trust you feel the momentum as we do. We look forward to seeing you at upcoming investor conferences, as well as our investor meeting scheduled for June 12th in New York. With that, Operator, please open the lines for questions."", 'See also 25 Best Zoos in the US and 16 Best Exercises For Lower Back Pain.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

The outperformance reflects strong domestic oil and gas production.However, the company’s bottom line fell from the year-ago adjusted profit of 88 cents due to weaker oil realizations.The company reported revenues of $1.7 billion, which came 2% above the consensus mark but fell 2.4% from the year-ago sales.', 'Marathon Oil Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Marathon Oil Corporation Quote', '\xa0', 'This Texas-based energy explorer’s total net production (from U.S. and International units) in the quarter under review came in at 404,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) compared with 333,000 BOE/d in the year-ago period.U.S. E&P: This U.S. upstream unit reported an income of $468 million, down from $510 million in the year-ago period due to lower commodity price realizations and higher costs, partly offset by stronger production. We modeled the segment income at $441.3 million.Marathon Oil’s average realized liquids price (crude oil and condensate) of $77.28 per barrel were 8.3% lower than the year-earlier level of $84.29 and narrowly missed our projection of $77.80. Additionally, natural gas liquids’ average price realizations decreased 19.6% to $20.92 a barrel. Finally, average realized natural gas prices plunged 52.9% year over year to $2.32 per thousand cubic feet and missed our estimate of $2.84.Meanwhile, production costs were $6.51 per BOE, representing a 3.5% year-over-year rise.Net production of 352,000 BOE/d was up 26.6% from fourth-quarter 2022. Total U.S. output, which came ahead of our projection of 330,000 BOE/d, comprised approximately 56% oil, or 198,000 barrels per day (bpd).Significantly higher year-over-year production from Eagle Ford favored the company’s quarterly performance. The Eagle Ford region recorded an average production of 144,000 BOE/d, surging 58.2% from the fourth-quarter 2022 level, while output from Bakken was 118,000 BOE/d compared with 94,000 BOE/d in the year-ago quarter. Meanwhile, the Oklahoma output came in at 49,000 BOE/d, just down from the year-ago level of 50,000 BOE/d.International E&P: The segment, which explores and produces oil and gas in Equatorial Guinea, reported earnings of $51 million compared with $129 million in the year-ago period and our projection of $33.5 million. These results could be primarily blamed on lower output and liquid prices.Marathon reported production available for sale of 52,000 BOE/d, down from 55,000 Boe/d in fourth-quarter 2022 and below our projection of 67,000 BOE/d.Marathon’s average realized liquids prices (crude oil and condensate) of $47.43 per barrel reflected a 20% deterioration from the year-earlier quarter. Natural gas and natural gas liquids’ average price realizations came in at 24 cents per thousand cubic feet and $1 a barrel, respectively, the same as the corresponding period of 2022.', '\xa0', 'Total costs in the quarter were $1.2 billion, up 18.9% from the prior-year period and exceeded our expectation by 8.5%.

Further, Marathon expects oil volumes in the band of 185,000-195,000 barrels per day.', 'While we have discussed Marathon Oil’s fourth-quarter results in detail, let’s see how some other upstream companies have fared this earnings season.One of the world’s largest independent oil and gas producers, ConocoPhillips COP, reported fourth-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $2.40, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.08. The bottom line, however, declined from the prior-year quarter’s $2.71 per share. ConocoPhillips’ higher oil equivalent production volumes — up 8.2% year over year — led to a better-than-expected bottom line. The positives were partially offset by lower average realized oil equivalent prices.As of Dec 31, 2023, ConocoPhillips had $5.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents. COP’s total long-term debt was $17.9 billion, while it had a short-term debt of $1.1 billion. Capital expenditure and investments totaled $2.9 billion. Net cash provided by operating activities was $5.3 billion.Natural gas producer EQT Corporation EQT reported fourth-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 48 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The bottom line increased from the year-ago quarter’s adjusted earnings of 42 cents. EQT’s better-than-expected profits were driven by higher sales volumes, which increased to 564 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe) from the year-ago quarter’s 458.6 Bcfe.EQT’s adjusted operating cash flow was $774.6 million in the quarter, up from $621.8 million a year ago.

These commitments from customers, which will translate into revenue over multiple years, are for both manufacturing and advanced packaging services."", 'It\'s been about a month since Intel\'s disclosure that it had surpassed $10 billion of lifetime deal value for its foundry business. During the company\'s foundry event last week, Intel updated that figure to more than $15 billion.

The AI boom and the sky-high price tag attached to data center GPUs capable of training and running AI models have only increased the urgency to bring chip design in-house.', 'Intel and Microsoft didn\'t disclose much about the chips destined for the former\'s manufacturing lines. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said: ""...we need a reliable supply of the most advanced, high-performance, and high-quality semiconductors.

By designing its own server CPUs, Microsoft can optimize its infrastructure to a degree that's just not possible with off-the-shelf parts."", ""While Intel's data center segment may lose sales to cloud giants designing their own server CPUs, the company is in a prime position to manufacture those custom Arm-based chips. Intel and Arm struck a deal last year to co-optimize the Arm architecture and the Intel 18A process."", ""The manufacturing deal with Intel could include second-generation versions of Microsoft's Maia or Cobalt chips, or it could be for something entirely different. Microsoft is also reportedly working on its own networking chip to reduce its reliance on Nvidia's networking products. AI servers need to pass data back and forth at high rates, so capable networking hardware is critical to squeezing the maximum performance out of AI chips."", ""Given the expansion of Arm-based chips into areas where Intel has historically dominated and the trend toward large tech companies designing their own chips, Intel's foundry push is coming at the perfect time. Had Intel stuck with its old model of keeping its manufacturing facilities to itself, the company's growth would have likely been stunted by rising competition."", ""The foundry business gives Intel the ability to benefit from this increased competition. While the company may lose market share in server and PC CPUs, the foundry opportunity is enormous. Global spending on foundry services topped $100 billion in 2022 and is expected to surpass $230 billion by 2032. It's not unthinkable that a decade from now, foundry services will be Intel's largest business by revenue."", ""Although financial terms weren't disclosed, the Microsoft win is a big one for Intel.

Euphoria surrounding the technology sent the Nasdaq Composite soaring over 40% last year. Moreover, megacap tech enterprises such as the ""Magnificent Seven"" have contributed greatly to the S&P 500\'s new record highs.', ""Among the Magnificent Seven stocks, Microsoft and Nvidia often find themselves at the center of media coverage -- and for good reason. Microsoft is a major investor in ChatGPT developer OpenAI. Meanwhile, demand for Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) is unprecedented as applications in quantum computing and machine learning skyrocket."", ""One company that I see as overlooked is e-commerce and cloud computing specialist Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). The company has made some interesting investments in AI. But slowing growth in its cloud segment coupled with a strained macroeconomy have some investors wary of the company's prospects."", ""Let's dig into why 2024 might be a good year for Amazon investors. More importantly, taking a thorough look at the company's position in the AI landscape may shed some light on why Amazon should not be discounted relative to its peers."", 'The Nasdaq Composite index has been around for a little over 50 years. In that time frame, it has only produced negative annual returns 14 times.', 'Over the last two decades, however, the Nasdaq has only dropped by 30% or more on three occasions: 2002, 2008, and 2022. Keep in mind that 2008 was a difficult period in financial history, as it marked the beginning of the Great Recession. Additionally, 2022 was perhaps equally as debilitating for investors due to rampant inflation. But over the last couple of years, the Federal Reserve has swiftly taken action -- increasing interest rates in an effort to curb rising inflation.', 'One thing that 2002 and 2008 share in common is that following steep declines, the Nasdaq rebounded sharply in consecutive years thereafter. Between 2003 and 2007, the Nasdaq returned an average of 16% per year. Furthermore, from 2009 to 2010 the index rose by an average of 30%.', ""While it's important to understand that past results do not guarantee future performance, the analysis above highlights that the capital markets tend to operate with a level of resiliency. Given the impressive performance of the Nasdaq in 2023, coupled with rising interest in AI, this year could be another good one for the tech-heavy index."", ""Back in September, Amazon announced a multibillion-dollar investment in Anthropic, a competitor to OpenAI. The partnership with Anthropic contained many interesting features, the bulk of which are aimed at bolstering Amazon's cloud business."", ""For the last couple of years, businesses of all sizes have scaled back on budgets and operated under much tighter financial controls. This dynamic greatly impacted tech businesses as demand for enterprise software waned. Amazon was not immune to this trend, and sales from its cloud business have slowed down. To add another layer of complexity, Amazon's cloud unit represents nearly 70% of the company's operating profits."", ""After looking at management's commentary surrounding the Anthropic investment, it becomes more clear how Amazon plans to use this relationship to spark new interest in the cloud. Per the terms of the deal, Anthropic will be using Amazon Web Services (AWS) as its primary cloud provider. Moreover, Anthropic will also be using Amazon's in-house semiconductor chips to train future generative AI models."", 'In a way, Anthropic could end up serving as a lucrative source of lead generation for AWS. As Amazon continues to introduce more AI-powered applications in the cloud, the company could very well begin to see an uptick in demand thanks to Anthropic.', 'I see the potential of the Anthropic relationship as largely underappreciated, if not misunderstood. Just as Microsoft is implementing ChatGPT across its operating system, Amazon could replicate this template in order to spur new acceleration in AWS.', 'The chart above shows Amazon benchmarked against the Magnificent Seven members on a price-to-sales (P/S) basis. At a P/S of 3.1, Amazon is the lowest-valued stock among this cohort based on this metric.', ""The primary reason I think Nvidia and Microsoft are trading at noticeable premiums is that both companies have already shown investors how AI is positively impacting their businesses. The trends above could suggest that investors think Amazon is lacking in AI capabilities relative to its peers, or the company simply isn't showing enough growth to garner a premium valuation."", ""In either case, I see Amazon stock as dirt-cheap right now. AI has myriad applications and has the potential to disrupt Amazon's core e-commerce and cloud businesses."", ""I think the company is taking the right steps to position itself for long-term sustained growth. While Amazon may be overshadowed by others in big tech, I do not think the company's potential in the AI landscape should be discounted. Right now could be a unique opportunity to scoop up shares at an attractive valuation for long-term investors."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

Supermicro develops high-end AI servers powered by Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) top-tier GPUs, while Microsoft weaves OpenAI's generative AI tools into its own cloud-based services."", 'Supermicro went public at $8 per share with a valuation of $229 million in March 2007, but it now trades at about $750 a share with a market cap of $44 billion. That massive rally would have turned a $10,000 investment into more than $940,000.', 'Supermicro is still a lot smaller than Microsoft, which saw its market cap hit $3 trillion earlier this year, and smaller than its two larger competitors in the server market, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE) and Dell Technologies (NYSE: DELL). But if Supermicro continues firing on all cylinders, could it grow into a multi-trillion-dollar AI giant like Microsoft by 2050?', ""Supermicro is the world's third-largest server company with a market share of 5%, according to History-Computer. Dell leads the market with a 19% share, followed by HPE with a 13% share. Grand View Research expects the global server market to grow at a steady compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9% from 2023 to 2030."", 'Supermicro differentiates itself from its slower-growth competitors by mainly producing high-performance servers instead of low- to mid-range servers. Its design partnership with Nvidia grants it access to its top-tier GPUs before other server makers, and that competitive edge enabled it to capitalize on the explosive growth of the generative AI market.', ""Supermicro now generates roughly half of its revenue from dedicated AI servers powered by Nvidia's GPUs. Bank of America estimates that Supermicro already controls 10% of the dedicated AI server market -- and it expects its share to rise to 17% within the next three years as the entire niche market expands by 150%."", ""From fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2020 (which ended in June 2020), Supermicro's annual revenue grew at a CAGR of 17%. Its revenue dipped 7% in fiscal 2021 as the pandemic disrupted the global server market, but surged 46% in fiscal 2022 and grew 37% in fiscal 2023 as the AI market's growth accelerated. From fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026, analysts expect its revenue to continue rising at a CAGR of 42%."", ""Supermicro still doesn't seem expensive right now at 3 times this year's sales. Assuming its price-to-sales ratio holds steady, its market cap could reach $61 billion by fiscal 2026 -- marking a near-40% gain from its current levels."", ""But to reach Microsoft's current market cap of $3 trillion by 2050 with the same price-to-sales ratio, Supermicro would need to generate $1 trillion in revenue. To reach that target, it would need to grow at a 24-year CAGR of 18% from fiscal 2026."", ""That might seem achievable relative to its previous growth rates, but Supermicro could face some unpredictable challenges before 2050. Nvidia could deepen its ties with Dell, HPE, and other server makers to drive the growth of the data center GPU market. The AI market could stall out after the next few economic downturns, and Supermicro could be revalued as a legacy server maker like HPE and Dell -- which both trade at less than 1 time this year's sales -- instead of as a hypergrowth stock."", ""Simply put, Supermicro needs to keep hitting home runs over the next three decades to reach Microsoft's current market cap. But even if Supermicro somehow becomes a $3 trillion stock by 2050, Microsoft would likely be worth a lot more."", ""Supermicro is still a great growth stock, but it's futile to compare a server maker to a diversified software giant like Microsoft -- which owns the world's top PC operating system (Windows), the most popular productivity software suite (Office), and the second-largest public cloud platform (Azure). Supermicro certainly has the potential to become a trillion-dollar stock over the next few decades if it plays its cards right, but I doubt it will ever come close to matching Microsoft's valuations."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

The billionaire heads up Appaloosa Management -- the hedge fund he founded back in 1993. He has been called ""arguably the greatest hedge fund manager of his generation"" by Forbes magazine and has ""consistently outperformed his industry peers and the broader global markets since [Appaloosa\'s] inception,"" according to Carnegie Mellon University.', ""The results speak for themselves. Over the past three years, Appaloosa has outperformed the S&P 500 by nearly 17%, a remarkable accomplishment considering the macroeconomic downturn that plagued investors during 2022. Given his robust results, Tepper's stock picks might be worthy of additional review."", ""Appaloosa's portfolio is heavily weighted toward artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, with just five companies representing more than 46% of the fund's holdings to close out the fourth quarter:"", 'Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META): 11.6%', 'Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT): 11.3%', 'Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN): 10.6%', 'Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA): 6.9%', 'Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG): 5.7%', ""Keep in mind that hedge funds only report their holdings at the end of each quarter, and while these five stocks combined are largely unchanged compared to the third quarter, there's been a big shakeup among the holdings."", ""Meta Platforms continues to be Tepper's top holding, largely unchanged since the prior quarter. The company's history of using AI to surface relevant content for users on its social media sites is well documented. Furthermore, as the world's second-largest digital advertising platform, Meta makes the lion's share of its revenue from targeted advertising -- which is more effective when assisted by AI."", ""The company isn't resting on its laurels, recently releasing a suite of AI-powered tools for its advertisers, designed to help better reach their desired audience. Furthermore, its LLaMA AI (Large Language Model Meta AI) has become one of the leading open-source AI models and can be found on each of the major cloud infrastructure platforms -- for a price."", 'Meta gained 172% last year, so even as Tepper decreased his share count by 5%, the stock -- as a percentage of his portfolio -- is virtually unchanged.', 'Recognizing the vast opportunity ahead, Microsoft was quick off the blocks to integrate generative AI capabilities into its widely used workplace productivity tools and cloud infrastructure platform.', ""Microsoft's AI assistant, Copilot, is the standard-bearer for these innovations. Users are rushing to adopt Copilot thanks to its ability to increase user productivity. Several analysts have suggested that Copilot could generate incremental revenue of $100 billion by 2027. Perhaps as importantly, Copilot is having a halo effect on Microsoft's Azure, which outgrew its cloud infrastructure rivals in the fourth quarter. Furthermore, management credited 6 percentage points of that growth to increasing demand for AI."", ""Tepper was likely impressed by the company's strong move in AI and market share gains in the cloud. This gave him an incentive to increase his Microsoft share count by 4%, bringing it to 11.3% of his portfolio. It probably doesn't hurt that it's only selling at a slight premium to the overall market -- a bargain for potential growth of this magnitude."", ""Amazon has a trifecta of successful businesses, including its industry-leading e-commerce and cloud infrastructure operations, as well as the company's No. 3 digital advertising platform. Amazon has long been at the forefront of AI development, using these sophisticated algorithms to improve its operations, from making product recommendations to scheduling the most efficient delivery routes."", ""More recently, the company introduced Amazon Rufus, a digital shopping assistant designed to answer product questions, make comparisons, and make recommendations based on specified criteria. Furthermore, Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers have access to all the latest generative AI models, which could reignite the company's cloud growth."", ""Tepper obviously sees additional upside, as he increased Appaloosa's holdings by 5%, bringing Amazon to 10.6% of its total portfolio. And at just 2 times next year's sales, Amazon stock is a steal."", 'Nvidia is arguably the poster child for the AI revolution, as its graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard not only for gaming, but also for data centers, speeding information through the ether. Their unmatched computational horsepower has given the company a near monopoly on GPUs for both machine learning and data center use cases, with 95% of their respective markets. This supremacy gave the company a leg up in the generative AI market, which it has dominated from the outset.', ""However, Tepper cut its stake in Nvidia by 23%, knocking it down to 6.9% of Appaloosa's holdings, from 8.8% in the third quarter. However, Nvidia stock jumped 239% last year, so Tepper likely took the opportunity to lock in some profits."", 'Alphabet\'s Google Search acts as a funnel to fuel the company\'s industry-leading digital advertising business, which is also fueled by AI. The company was quick out of the gate to develop its generative AI functionality, infusing AI across a broad cross-section of its Android and Google products. Like Amazon and Microsoft, Google is one of the ""Big Three"" cloud providers, giving it the perfect channel to sell AI products to its cloud customers.', 'Recent developments include the debut of Gemini AI, which the company calls its ""largest and most capable AI model."" Google Cloud\'s Vertex AI continues to expand, providing access to 130 foundational AI models, with something to suit every need.', ""For all its potential, however, Appaloosa sold roughly 16% of its Alphabet holdings last quarter, bringing its stake to 5.7%, down from 7.2%. While Tepper hasn't addressed the move, it's likely he saw greater potential opportunities for Microsoft and Amazon."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

I'm kidding, of course, but there's at least some truth in the tongue-in-cheek statement."", 'AI provided a massive tailwind for the top growth stocks last year. These high-flying stocks are collectively known as the ""Magnificent Seven: Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), and Tesla. The momentum is continuing in 2024 for several of them.', ""The level of magnificence for these stocks varies, though. Which Magnificent Seven stock is poised for the most spectacular growth? Here's the hands-down winner -- at least over the next few years."", ""All of the Magnificent Seven stocks could have tremendous long-term prospects. Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft should enjoy strong growth as organizations move to the cloud to run AI apps. Apple has opportunities in augmented reality, services, and more. Tesla, Nvidia, Alphabet's Waymo unit, Amazon's Zoox, and potentially Apple could make a lot of money in the future with the advent of autonomous vehicles."", ""However, one company stands head and shoulders above the rest. Nvidia made this fact abundantly clear with its latest quarterly update. It wasn't Nvidia's fourth-quarter numbers themselves, although they were great. Instead, it's what the company's executives said about the future."", 'Nvidia CFO Colette Kress set the tone early in the fourth-quarter call by stating, ""The world has reached the tipping point of a new computing era."" She explained that this new era is due to the rapid transition to accelerated computing needed to power what Nvidia calls ""AI factories"" -- data centers specifically built for AI systems.', ""Sure, the rest of the Magnificent Seven companies will likely benefit from this new computing era, too. But nearly all of them use Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs). At least for now, the only way they'll succeed in this new age is by fueling Nvidia's success."", ""Kress name-dropped several of the other six members of the Magnificent Seven in her comments. She noted that cloud providers such as Microsoft generated more than half of Nvidia's data center revenue in Q4."", ""She said that Nvidia is working with multiple leaders in large language models (LLMs), including Google and Microsoft (along with Microsoft's partner, OpenAI). Kress mentioned that Meta's use of AI (powered by Nvidia's GPUs) helped boost revenue in its latest quarter. She referred to a recent announcement that Amazon will use Nvidia DGX Cloud for its Amazon Web Services cloud platform. Although Kress didn't refer to Tesla by name, she did point out that the company is working to help several companies use AI in autonomous driving."", 'Nvidia expects that revenue for the first quarter of its fiscal year 2025 will be $24 billion. This amount reflects 234% year-over-year growth and nearly 9% sequential growth. But how much growth can Nvidia realistically deliver going forward?', 'Like most companies, Nvidia doesn\'t provide details on its longer-term outlook. However, CEO Jensen Huang stated in the Q4 call, ""[F]undamentally, the conditions are excellent for continued growth in calendar \'24 to calendar \'25 and beyond."" He cited two major trends as the reasons for his optimism.', ""First, Huang echoed Kress' comments about the transition to accelerated computing. This opportunity is massive all by itself. Kress mentioned that the current installed base of data center infrastructure is valued at roughly $1 trillion. And most, if not all, of it is quickly migrating to accelerated computing."", 'The second trend that Huang referenced is generative AI. He maintained that ""a whole new industry is being formed"" because of generative AI, adding that it is driving Nvidia\'s growth.', 'Huang believes that these two trends will cause the world\'s data center infrastructure installed base to double over the next five years. He predicted that the annual market opportunity from this explosion would be measured in ""the hundreds of billions"" of dollars. No company is better positioned to capitalize on this opportunity right now than Nvidia.', ""It's possible, of course, that Huang and Kress are seeing Nvidia's future with rose-colored glasses and are way too optimistic about the future. If accelerated computing and generative AI don't deliver the tailwinds they expect, Nvidia's growth won't be as great as anticipated."", 'Nvidia\'s success is also attracting competition. Advanced Micro Devices, for example, argues that its newest AI chips are as good as Nvidia\'s. ""Magnificent Seven"" members Meta and Microsoft are two large customers that plan to use AMD\'s chips to reduce their reliance on Nvidia. Several of Nvidia\'s big customers are developing their own AI chips as well.', ""Before Nvidia's blowout Q4 results, JPMorgan Chase analysts warned that supply could eventually exceed demand. While Kress stated in the quarterly call that even with supply increasing, the demand remains greater than supply. However, that could change down the road."", ""Finally, Nvidia could deliver the massive sales growth that seems to be on the way, but its stock still underperforms. How? A tremendous amount of growth is already baked into Nvidia's share price."", 'Still, the future for Nvidia appears to be very bright at this point. It arguably is the most magnificent of the Magnificent Seven.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

In fact, they were each worth more than $3 trillion before a recent sell-off in their stock.', ""One more company looks almost certain to join them and stay there. On Friday, within the first hour of the market opening, Nvidia crossed the $2 trillion mark but closed the day back under the major milestone. It is worth $1.97 trillion as of this writing, and $1 trillion of that value was created in the last 12 months alone. Following another spectacular set of financial results released this month, Nvidia is now charging toward a $2 trillion market cap. Here's why it's likely to get there -- and stay there -- this year."", ""Nvidia was founded in 1993 with a goal to bring 3D graphics to the gaming and multimedia industries. It released the world's first graphics processing unit (GPU) in 1999, which marked the birth of its GeForce brand, and it remains the dominant name in gaming today."", ""But GPUs are now transforming the data center. A GPU features hundreds of cores, which means it can process high volumes of data much faster than a traditional central processing unit (CPU) and makes it ideal for artificial intelligence (AI) workloads. Nvidia designed its H100 GPU for that specific purpose, and it has been almost single-handedly responsible for the company's incredible growth over the past year."", ""While the H100 is already the first choice for most AI data center operators, Nvidia's innovation engine has been hard at work developing the next iteration. It's called the H200, and it's twice as fast as the H100 when it comes to inferencing, which involves feeding an AI model live data so it can make predictions. It also consumes half the energy, making it far cheaper for data center operators to run. Shipments of the H200 will ramp up this year, and Nvidia already says there is no way it will keep up with demand."", ""Much of Nvidia's success can be attributed to its software ecosystem, which is increasingly important. Its CUDA platform allows developers to optimize their GPUs so they can develop applications much faster. But here's the kicker -- CUDA can't be used with chips from other manufacturers, so developers who are comfortable with CUDA have to stick with Nvidia's GPUs. That's why it will be so difficult for competitors to unseat Nvidia's dominance."", ""But that's not all. CEO Jensen Huang says Nvidia's engineers now manage, optimize, patch, and tune the AI software stack for businesses through its AI Enterprise platform. It's effectively an artificial intelligence operating system that offers development tools and pre-trained models to help businesses accelerate the creation of AI applications."", 'Nvidia AI Enterprise is accessible through major cloud platforms like Amazon Web services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, which effectively serve as distribution channels and give Nvidia access to millions of potential customers.', 'Huang believes every enterprise in the world deploying software will eventually use Nvidia AI Enterprise. It was only launched in 2021 -- before AI really took off -- yet it has already amassed $1 billion in annual revenue.', 'Nvidia just reported its financial results for fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28). Its revenue surged to $60.9 billion, which was up 126% compared to fiscal 2023, and as the below chart shows, it has increased more than tenfold in just the last eight years.', ""The data center was the main driver of Nvidia's spectacular fiscal year, thanks to AI and the H100 GPU.

Its forecast points to $24 billion in total revenue, which will represent 233% growth compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024.

It already leapfrogged tech giants like Amazon and Alphabet in terms of valuation, and if its stock gains just another 1.5%, it will join Apple and Microsoft in the $2 trillion club.', ""Based on Nvidia's $12.96 in non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share (profit) in fiscal 2024 and its current stock price of $788.17, it trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 60.6. That's almost twice the 32.1 P/E ratio of the Nasdaq-100 index, which implies Nvidia is extremely expensive. However, the stock market is a forward-looking machine."", 'Wall Street is already forecasting $20.44 in earnings for Nvidia in fiscal 2025, which would reduce its P/E ratio to 37.9 (assuming its stock price remained the same). While that is still more expensive than the Nasdaq-100, a company growing as quickly as Nvidia deserves a premium. There might even be significant upside to come.', ""A Wall Street analyst from Loop Capital believes Nvidia stock could jump 53% to $1,200. That would take Nvidia's valuation to almost $3 trillion! That target is a little ambitious -- if not unrealistic -- in the short term, but if Jensen Huang is right about the data center opportunity in the next five years, the stock could certainly get there in the longer term."", ""In any case, Nvidia's entry into the $2 trillion club now appears to be a foregone conclusion."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

And there's more than one culprit for darkening sentiment."", ""The past three years have been characterized by Walgreens' struggle to maintain a positive operating margin while it attempts to enter the primary care business. At the same time, its debt load of $34.7 billion is getting concerning, and the last few quarters have been characterized by selling off hundreds of millions of its investments to pay down its liabilities. Underscoring its increasingly fraught finances, Walgreens' quarterly dividend was cut by nearly half at the start of this year."", ""Management claims that its new healthcare segment's adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) will reach a break-even point sometime in its 2024 fiscal year. At the same time, they see the strengthening of headwinds like slower prescription growth and reduced consumer spending, both of which are sure to hurt its core retail pharmacy segment."", ""In short, if it makes operational progress in cutting costs and onboarding new customers in its primary care segment, it might be offset by a pullback elsewhere.

He tells Fortune he “could talk to you about coffee for a long time,” waxing rhapsodic about the way it's grown (one tree makes just one pound of coffee), the history of the bean, the chemistry of roasting, even the unroasted coffee cherries, or green coffee, that flavors Refreshers with a taste more like juice."", 'Other things he loves: the company he works for—and its union.', ""“I've always really enjoyed Starbucks as a company,” he told Fortune, and that's why he’s “so interested in staying with Starbucks and seeing what it could be with the union effort.”"", 'Larsen has been a Starbucks employee most of his adult life. He’s worked at different stores in Washington and Reno for nearly nine years and has moved through the ranks from barista to shift manager, assistant store manager and then store manager–but he stepped back down to a shift supervisor to join the union after, he said, “a hard time getting management to hear me.”', 'It’s really about Starbucks’ labor model, he explained. The labor model the company uses to schedule employees is sales-based. Each store gets a number of labor hours dependent on its recent sales and seasonal shifts like holidays. The issues that workers are facing include weeks when there aren’t enough labor hours for them to earn enough.', '“There’s been a lot of hour cuts across the country,” he said, adding that “maybe the hours will go down next week, but there’s still the same amount of staff.”', 'He’s far from alone, as the Starbucks union drive has been making headlines for years now. Recently, on February 20, workers at 21 stores across the country filed petitions nearly simultaneously with the National Labor Relations Board to join Starbucks Workers United, the company’s union group under Workers United, marking the union campaign’s biggest single-day filing since its launch in 2021.', 'The workers, or “partners,” as Starbucks calls them, joined nearly 400 other unionized stores that are demanding recognition along with predictable schedules (without spontaneous hour cuts that workers are seeing now), raises that reflect the cost of living, and timely repairs of broken equipment.', 'Another barista, Juniper Krone, told Fortune that hour cuts are a big concern for workers at her store, which is based in Longmont, Colorado, too.', 'Krone used to rely on 30 hours of work a week, and now considers getting 24 or 25 a “good week.”', ""“We haven’t been getting enough hours to run the store effectively and give our customers good service,” Krone said, adding that a lot of individuals aren't getting enough hours to support themselves, either. Krone, who has worked at Starbucks since 2022, said the hour cuts make it hard for her to afford her $1,600 single bedroom rent."", 'The current scheduling system, the workers said, causes situations where sometimes there are too many workers and other times, not enough. “This problem has been going on for at least a year and it’s steadily getting worse,” Krone said.', 'Beyond that, the schedules are based on sales a store made three weeks prior, according to Starbucks, which leads to delayed assessments of a store’s actual needs. Larsen described how “if there was a holiday where there was a lot more or less business,” the schedule, released three weeks later, would reflect the labor needs for that period.', 'When reached for comment, Starbucks said its scheduling practices aim to match workers’ availability and preferred hours to the changing needs of a store. For instance, a company spokesperson told Fortune, winter months are slower periods than summer, fall and holidays.', 'Starbucks also said it offers workers access to an online system called Shift Marketplace where workers can view and pick up additional shifts at neighboring stores. On a Starbucks thread on Reddit, though, users complained that neighboring stores had no shifts to pick up and that additional shifts aren’t available to view if they were already scheduled for five days.', 'Larsen and Krone also said that since their stores filed petitions to unionize, there has been more corporate management presence. For Larsen’s store, the increased presence meant broken equipment got some much-needed attention.', '“My store specifically gets really behind on broken machines and they build up,” he said. “Since filing to unionize, our management team has been working hard to fix everything really fast.”', 'Krone said her store has an increasing problem with drug use in the restrooms and has been asking management to install sharps containers in bathrooms. “They tell us we don’t have a high enough incident rate to install them,” Krone said, and worries about workers accidently getting injured.', 'Starbucks said that it employs a number of safety mitigation efforts, like adding lighting, removing cafe seating, and installing sharps containers, based on need, but said there’s no minimum number of incident reports it uses to determine a store’s need.', 'The stores’ employees have also been hearing more interest in the union from customers–some of whom are curious about what’s going on and some who express wanting to support a unionized store.', ""“We got a call the other day from a railroad worker who said he's been union for 30 years,” Larsen said, “and he was just really excited for us to unionize and that we should reach out if we needed any support.”"", 'Each store that now joins the union reached out to Workers United individually, Krone said, which led the group to organize a mass filing date. At her store, workers had after-hours conversations about joining the union before holding an election.', 'It was a similar process at Larsen’s store, where baristas and store supervisors created group chats and organized zoom meetings to have conversations. Aside from a great chance to see his co-workers’ cats, he said, they were often “discussions about what kind of challenges workers are facing.""', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

Although the stock market has been a genuine wealth-building machine over extended periods, the year-to-year performance of the major stock indexes is no more predictable than a coin flip.', 'Since this decade began, the major stock indexes traded off bear and bull markets in successive years. These swings were especially pronounced in the growth stock-driven Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC), which shed 33% of its value during the 2022 bear market, but has rocketed higher by 49% since the start of 2023.', 'But as of the closing bell on Feb. 21, 2024, the Nasdaq Composite was the only one of the three major stock indexes to have not put the 2022 bear market fully in the rearview mirror. This growth-fueled index remained 3% below its all-time high, set in November 2021.', ""Although some traders may view a 3% decline over a span of 27 months as a lost period for fast-paced companies, long-term investors are liable to see this decline as an opportunity. As long as the Nasdaq remains in the wake of the 2022 bear market and hasn't reached a new record close, bargains can still be found."", ""What follows are four exhilarating growth stocks you'll regret not buying in the wake of the Nasdaq bear market dip."", ""The first exciting growth stock you'll be kicking yourself for not buying with the Nasdaq Composite still attempting to put the 2022 bear market in the back seat is social media company Pinterest (NYSE: PINS)."", ""One of the biggest knocks against Pinterest by skeptics had been its lack of monthly active user (MAU) growth following the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic. When people were effectively stuck in their homes during the early stages of the pandemic, MAUs soared. When vaccines became available and life returned to some semblance of normal, the company's MAUs retraced. During the December-ended quarter, Pinterest tallied 498 million MAUs, which is an all-time high. Despite a wild couple of years, Pinterest has shown that its platform is resonating with more people than ever."", ""What's been particularly noteworthy about Pinterest's operating model is the resilience of its ad-pricing power. Although a 1% increase in average revenue per user (ARPU) in 2023 is a far cry from the double-digit ARPU growth it's consistently delivered, it's nevertheless impressive that ARPU is still climbing considering how challenging the advertising environment has been."", ""Perhaps the best aspect of Pinterest's operating model is that its 498 million MAUs willingly share their interests with the company, which provides critical data that advertisers/merchants can rely on to target users. Even though app developers have been giving users the option to remove tracking tools, they're not nearly as important for Pinterest."", ""Based on Wall Street's consensus estimate, Pinterest is expected to double its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to north of $2 by 2027. Assuming it continues to develop its e-commerce ambitions, this represents an attractive valuation for a leading (and continually growing) social platform."", ""A second exhilarating growth stock you'll regret not adding to your portfolio in the wake of the Nasdaq bear market swoon is auto parts retailer AutoZone (NYSE: AZO)."", ""The first factor working in AutoZone's favor is that Americans are hanging on to their vehicles longer than ever before. Last year, S&P Global subsidiary S&P Global Mobility noted the average age of the 284 million vehicles currently registered in the U.S. is 12.5 years. Rapidly rising prices for new vehicles, coupled with tight supply (partly due to the pandemic), have encouraged owners to hang on to their existing vehicles for a lengthier period. That's excellent news for auto parts suppliers like AutoZone, which are helping owners keep their older cars running well."", 'AutoZone\'s operating success is also a reflection of its innovation on the supply chain front. A few years ago, management chose to add 20 ""mega hubs"" to its distribution network. These mega hubs carry up to 110,000 stock keeping units (SKUs), and they\'re designed to be centrally located to ensure that stores can quickly access the part(s) they need.', ""Another reason growth investors can trust AutoZone is its virtually unbeatable share repurchase program. While Apple may have the largest nominal-dollar buyback program among public companies, AutoZone's aggregate repurchases put it in a class of its own. Since initiating a stock repurchase program in 1998, the company's board has authorized $37.7 billion in share repurchases. Through Nov. 18, 2023, the company had bought back $35.3 billion worth of its stock, which represents 89% of its outstanding shares since 1998."", 'With forecast annualized earnings growth of 11% over the coming five years, AutoZone remains a bargain.', ""The third stirring growth stock you'll be mad at yourself for overlooking following the 2022 bear market drop for the Nasdaq Composite is specialty drug developer Jazz Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: JAZZ)."", ""One of the best aspects of investing in healthcare stocks is that the sector is highly defensive. Demand for prescription drugs and healthcare services doesn't cease just because the U.S. economy isn't growing as quickly, or following a rough couple of weeks for Wall Street. Consistency of demand for Jazz's novel therapies leads to predictable, high-margin operating cash flow in virtually any economic climate."", ""For quite some time, Jazz's oxybate franchise (Xyrem and Xywav) has been powering its growth. These are therapies that treat a variety of sleep disorders, including narcolepsy. The genius move Jazz made was to develop Xywav, which is a second-generation treatment that contains 92% less sodium than Xyrem, a drug that's topped $1 billion in annual sales. Xywav's reduced sodium content makes it a safer alternative for patients with potential cardiovascular issues, and it more importantly protects the company's cash flow from generic competition for a long time to come."", 'In addition to its oxybate franchise, Jazz is seeing the needle point decisively higher for its oncology portfolio and cannabidiol drug Epidiolex. Label expansion opportunities for Epidiolex could push peak annual sales of the drug to more than $1 billion. Meanwhile, organic growth of existing cancer therapies and an expanding pipeline should lift annual oncology sales well past $1 billion.', 'In terms of valuation, Jazz Pharmaceuticals is tough to top among drug developers. Annual earnings growth is expected to average 10% over the coming five years. However, shares of Jazz can be scooped up for just a little over 6 times forecast EPS in 2025.', ""A fourth exhilarating growth stock you'll regret not buying in the wake of the Nasdaq bear market dip is global coffee chain Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX)."", ""What's made Starbucks such an incredible investment for decades is the exceptional loyalty of its customers. As of the end of 2023, 34.3 million people were Starbucks rewards members, which was up 13% from the prior-year period. On average, rewards members spend more per ticket than non-members, and they're also likelier to use mobile ordering, which expedites the ordering process and keeps Starbucks' stores operating efficiently."", ""Something else working in Starbucks' favor is its innovation. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Starbucks had to completely rethink drive-thru lanes given that many of its stores were closed. The addition of video to the ordering board made drive-thru transactions more personal, while food and drink pairing suggestions on drive-thru menus represented an easy way to increase ticket size and lift margins."", ""I'd be remiss if I didn't also mention Starbucks is perfectly positioned to benefit from the expansion of China's economy. The world's No. 2 economy by gross domestic product only abandoned its stringent COVID-19 mitigation measures in December 2022. As supply chain kinks are worked out and China's economy finds its footing, Starbucks' nearly 7,000 stores located there should benefit."", ""Lastly, Starbucks' stock is as cheap as it's been in at least a decade. Shares are valued at 20 times forward-year earnings, yet Wall Street anticipates average annual earnings growth of 16% over the next five years. Considering how strong Starbucks' branding and pricing power are, this is an exceptional deal for patient growth-seeking investors."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Pinterest right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Pinterest, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Pinterest wasn’t one of them.

', ""In June 2022, year-over-year consumer price index (CPI) inflation reached a 40-year high of 9.1%. However, throughout most of 2023, stabilized prices were observed due to elevated interest rates and declining energy prices. Despite a slowing rate of increase, the latest CPI reading remains somewhat discouraging for investors who anticipated a continuous decline in inflation with the latest Federal Reserve monetary policy measures. The most recent report from the Labor Department indicates that in January, the CPI rose 3.1% year-over-year, a decrease from December's 3.4% gain but higher than the expected 2.9% increase. On a monthly basis, the CPI increased by 0.3%, surpassing economists' estimates of a 0.2% gain."", 'The current US inflation and the possibility of a more lenient Federal Reserve policy are sparking discussions about a mild economic slowdown instead of a recession, a severe economic downturn, or a bear market, according to JPMorgan. Leading indicators suggest a deceleration in growth rather than a sudden collapse. Some indicators, such as real estate, corporate, and household delinquency rates, are on the rise, but history shows that these usually trail behind other signals for investors. Essentially, equity markets typically hit their lowest points well before the peak of economic turmoil, with the dot-com cycle being a notable exception. While there is still risk of a recession in 2025, it is important to note that even if it occurs, it is likely to be mild, especially with the Federal Reserve offering significant indirect liquidity to the banking system. JPMorgan acknowledged that investors face challenges, including the impact on public sector finances due to large deficits, markets that have already factored in a very gradual economic slowdown, and the significant influence of mega-cap stocks. In 2023, S&P 500 earnings remained stagnant. However, they surged by 33% for the top 7 mega-cap stocks and declined by 5% for the rest of the S&P 500. Taking everything into account, 2024 seems poised for a year of decelerating GDP growth, single-digit earnings growth, and single-digit returns for the average S&P 500 stock, per the bank’s report. ', 'On February 18, Goldman Sachs increased its year-end target for the S&P 500 index to 5,200, indicating a potential 4% increase from its current levels. This adjustment is attributed to a more positive earnings outlook for the companies within the index. Previously, Goldman Sachs had anticipated the index reaching 5,100 by the end of 2024. This initial projection was then revised from 4,700 in December, driven by factors such as moderating inflation and the anticipation of the US central bank implementing interest rate reductions throughout the year. David Kostin, lead strategist at Goldman Sachs, told Reuters: ', '""We expect strong world GDP growth and a slightly weaker dollar will support EPS, while lower rates and lower oil prices will be a slight drag."" ', ""In 2024, Morningstar believes that the focus will shift towards a more fundamental analysis of individual companies and sectors, moving away from the macroeconomic and behavioral factors that influenced the market in recent years. Economic growth was expected to decelerate not only in the fourth quarter of 2023 but the trend will persist throughout the next three quarters, until a resurgence in the third quarter. Expectations include the Federal Reserve initiating rate cuts in 2024 and throughout 2025, concluding by 2026. This reduction in the federal funds rate is predicted to bring the 10-year Treasury yield down to a long-term projection of 2.75%, a decline from the current 4%. In terms of GDP growth, short-term forecasts align closely with consensus, but over a five-year horizon, Morningstar expects a cumulative 3% higher real GDP growth compared to consensus. This is primarily attributed to perspectives on the supply side, involving labor force expansion and productivity growth. Inflation has significantly receded, and by the second quarter of 2024, a return to the Federal Reserve's 2% target is forecasted."", 'Amid this market backdrop, some investors prefer to buy stocks that are trading near 52-week lows to reap the benefits later.

EPS of US$2.89 were also better than expected, beating analyst predictions by 18%. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of.

In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$6.60b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$9.20 in 2024.

This is compared to a historical growth rate of 14% over the past five years.

That's an extremely asset-light model and allows profitable growth."", ""It's difficult to look at Celsius' growth and valuation and not be concerned.

I think Celsius could be bigger than Monster in time, and that would mean more than six-fold revenue growth. 2024 will be a step in that direction as the company gets better shelf space and starts to push international growth."", ""Operational momentum is important in consumer-facing brands, and that's a major tailwind for Celsius. As they see it more across the U.S., more consumers are trying it, and all indications are that they're adopting it into their drink routines rapidly."", ""I think this growth trend can last for at least the next decade as Celsius gets into more stores and pushes into more countries.

With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim."", 'Jim Risoleo: Thank you, Jaime, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. 2023 was a terrific year for Host on several fronts. First, we delivered strong operational improvements, driven largely by occupancy increases and continued rate growth. Second, we completed the work on the three strategic objectives we established in 2021 and we will continue to realize the benefits of our ongoing efforts well into the future. Third, we returned significant capital to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, continue to successfully allocate capital through reinvestment in our portfolio and announced an agreement with Hyatt to complete transformational renovations at six properties in our portfolio. Lastly, we maintained an investment grade balance sheet and continue to position Host to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities we see in the lodging space including potential acquisition opportunities.', 'Turning to our results. We finished 2023 above the midpoint of our full year guidance range. We delivered adjusted EBITDAre of $1.629 billion and adjusted FFO per share of $1.92. Comparable hotel total RevPAR grew 8.3% and comparable hotel RevPAR grew 8.1% compared to 2022. Notably, comparable hotel EBITDA margin was 60 basis points ahead of 2019 due in large part to our efforts to redefine the hotel operating model with our managers. During the fourth quarter, we delivered adjusted EBITDAre of $378 million and adjusted FFO per share of $0.44, which includes $26 million of business interruption proceeds from Hurricane Ian. Comparable hotel RevPAR improved 1.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Our RevPAR performance for the quarter was driven by an increase in both occupancy and rate.', 'Despite an estimated 30 basis point impact from the wildfires in Maui, our fourth quarter comparable hotel EBITDA margin of 28.1% was flat to 2019. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter since the onset of the pandemic that we have achieved total RevPAR, RevPAR comparable hotel EBITDA and margins at or above 2019 levels. I will say that one more time. We have delivered operating metrics at or above 2019 levels for nearly two years. As a reminder, the operational results discussed today refer to our comparable hotel portfolio in 2023, which excludes Hyatt Coconut Point and Ritz-Carlton, Naples. In 2024, our comparable hotel portfolio only excludes Ritz-Carlton Naples. During the fourth quarter, our portfolio results were once again impacted by the evolving nature of demand at our three resorts on Maui.', 'We estimate that the Maui wildfires impacted fourth quarter comparable hotel RevPAR by 130 basis points, comparable hotel total RevPAR by 150 basis points, comparable hotel EBITDA by $9 million and comparable hotel EBITDA margin by 30 basis points. For the full year, we estimate that Maui impacted our comparable hotel RevPAR by 50 basis points, comparable hotel total RevPAR by 70 basis points, comparable hotel EBITDA by $13 million and comparable hotel EBITDA margin by 10 basis points. Including our joint venture timeshare, we estimate that Maui impacted adjusted EBITDAre by $15 million in the fourth quarter and $22 million for the full year. Our risk management team is continuing to engage with our insurers about potential business interruption coverage at Maui and the timing and amounts of any potential proceeds are not yet known.', 'Shifting to another market that remains top of mind. San Francisco results showed meaningful year-over-year improvement in the fourth quarter. RevPAR was up 10%, driven by both rate and occupancy and F&B revenue was up 15%. Group business is driving the strong results with group room revenue up 36% for the fourth quarter compared to last year as our properties have shifted their focus to in-house groups until the citywide calendar improves in 2025. We have seen positive trends from 2023 continuing in the first quarter of 2024 with conventions driving weekday demand. In fact, January was the best month in the history of the San Francisco Marriott Marquis, with total revenue and EBITDA setting all time records. Briefly looking at out-of-room spend in the fourth quarter, comparable hotel, food and beverage and other revenues were down slightly due to impacts from Maui.', 'We estimate that Maui impacted fourth quarter F&B and other revenues by 60 basis points and 540 basis points, respectively. Encouragingly, the out-of-room revenue trends we have seen post-pandemic remain elevated for the rest of our portfolio. In addition to driving strong RevPAR growth and operating improvements across the business, we continue to be recognized as a global leader in corporate responsibility over the course of 2023. We introduced new 2030 environmental and social targets, which are aligned with our vision of becoming a net positive company by 2050, incorporate the progress made toward our prior goals, and are more reflective of our current portfolio by updating our baseline to 2019. These environmental and social targets will enable our team to focus on and measure our progress over the long-term.', 'Our 2030 environmental targets are in their third generation and put hosts on a linear path to net zero operations by 2040, leaving 10 years to get to net positive by 2050. We now have 14 properties with lead certification and projects in the pipeline at 19 properties. In addition, we are the only lodging REIT to have green building certifications linked to our sustainable financings. In this year’s corporate responsibility report, we highlighted our asset level climate risk assessment across three near-term climate perils including flood, wind and wildfire, and three long-term perils including heat, cold and water stress. Based on the results, we have identified assets with elevated climate risk and their corresponding EBITDA contributions, which allows us to prioritize capital investments in resilience and better underwrite potential acquisitions.', 'Our 2030 social targets are in their second generation and now include two responsible supply chain targets around supplier diversity and responsible sourcing and one new community impact target. As an employer of choice, we aim to lead our industry by integrating diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging best practices into all aspects of our culture. Turning to capital allocation, we repurchased 1.9 million shares at an average price of $16.50 per share in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we repurchased 11.4 million shares at an average price of $15.93 per share for a total of $181 million. We have approximately $792 million of remaining capacity under the repurchase program. In the fourth quarter, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share, an 11% increase over the prior quarter.', 'We also announced a special dividend of $0.25 per share bringing the total dividends declared for the year to $0.90 per share. In total, we returned over $700 million of capital to shareholders in 2023. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, the buyer of the Sheraton New York repaid the $250 million seller financing loan, we provided to effectuate the disposition. Our size, scale and balance sheet have allowed us to provide seller financing on three recent dispositions at a time when debt capital was scarce. Further demonstrating that our fortress balance sheet and unparalleled access to capital creates unique opportunities and substantial value for shareholders. Turning back to fourth quarter operations, our overall business mix results were skewed by Maui as leisure transient demand decreased and group demand increased, driven by recovery and relief groups.', 'Outside of this temporary demand shift, business mix results were as expected. Group led to growth with nearly 1 million group room nights sold in the fourth quarter, bringing our total group nights sold for 2023 to 4.1 million, or 112% of comparable 2022 actual group room nights. Business transient continued its gradual improvement with 7% revenue growth for the quarter and leisure remaining strong with transient rates at our resorts up 58% to 2019, including our three Maui resorts. As we look at the current backdrop for our business, we are optimistic about 2024 for several reasons. First, macroeconomic sentiment is incrementally more positive with consensus expectations of a soft landing. Second, supply levels and anticipated growth in supply is at historically low levels in our markets and chain scales.', 'Third, we expect tailwinds from increased airline capacity, continued improvement in the international inbound demand imbalance, and lastly, the transactions market is expected to pick up as improved macroeconomic sentiment allows for more visibility on operating performance and the market is expecting that we will see rate cuts later this year. As we consider these factors, we believe host is best positioned to capitalize on acquisition opportunities with $2.9 billion of total available liquidity and net leverage of 1.9 times. In addition, we have completed 24 transformational renovations and four development ROI projects, which we believe provide meaningful tailwinds for our portfolio. Looking at results to date, of the 10 hotels that have stabilized post renovation operations, the average RevPAR index share gain is 8.2 points, which is well in excess of our targeted gain of 3 to 5 points.', 'We are also continuing to reinvest in our portfolio with additional comprehensive renovations and resiliency investments underway, and we do not expect meaningful disruption this year. And most importantly, we believe that diverse demand drivers in our portfolio leave us well positioned for top line growth. Sourav will discuss more operational detail in our 2024 outlook in a few minutes. Turning to portfolio reinvestment in 2023, we invested nearly $650 million in capital expenditures at our properties, completing renovations to approximately 3,500 guest rooms, 111,000 square feet of meeting space and approximately 110,000 square feetof public space. In addition, we substantially completed property restorations following Hurricane Ian. In 2024, our capital expenditure guidance range is $500 million to $605 million, which reflects approximately $225 million to $280 million of investment for redevelopment, repositioning and ROI projects.', 'Within the Hyatt Transformational Capital program, we have already started renovations at the Grand Hyatt Atlanta and the Grand Hyatt Washington, which we expect to complete in the first half of 2025. We will also start transformational renovations at the Hyatt Regency Reston in the fourth quarter of this year. Other major ROI projects include the completion of renovations at the Hilton Singer Island Resort and the construction of the Finishing Canyon Suites Villa expansion. In addition to our capital expenditure investment, we expect to spend $50 million to $70 million on the luxury condominium development at Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World Resort this year. We expect to benefit from approximately $9 million of operating profit guarantees related to the Hyatt Transformational Capital program, which will offset the expected revenue disruption at those properties for 2024.', 'We are extremely proud of our operational and financial performance in 2023 and the iconic portfolio and balance sheet we have built and maintained. Our people, our platform and our portfolio have allowed us to create meaningful shareholder value and we are confident in the significant opportunities ahead for continued growth and value creation in 2024. With that, I will now turn the call over to Sourav.', ""Sourav Ghosh: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Building on Jim's comments, I will go into detail on our fourth quarter operations full year 2024 guidance and our balance sheet. Starting with business mix, overall transient revenue was down 5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by the evolving nature of demand in Maui. We estimate that Maui had a 590 basis point impact to transient revenue, which was evenly split between demand and rate. We were encouraged that transient rate at our resorts grew 2% above last year's tough comparisons despite the demand impact from Maui and renovation disruption. Looking ahead to spring break, transient revenue pace is up for our portfolio compared to the same time last year, driven by occupancy and rate growth at our resorts."", 'Outside of Maui, resort transient revenue pace for spring breakis up 20%. Business transient revenue was up over 7% to the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by both rate and demand growth at our downtown properties. Business transient demand continued its slow and steady recovery. Room nights at our downtown properties were down 15% in the fourth quarter compared to 2019, which is the smallest gap to the 2019post-pandemic. For the full year, business transient demand grew 12% over 2022. In 2024, we expect further demand growth driven by large corporates alongside rate growth in the mid-single-digits. Turning to group. 2023 was the year of group and convention hotel recovery. For the full year, group room revenues increased 21% over last year and room night volume recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.', ""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui. Excluding Maui, group room night volume recovered to 94% of 2019 levels. Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter, driven by an increase in both rate and room nights, and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui. Outside of Maui, hotels in San Francisco, Boston, DC and Seattle contributed to the group room night increase. Notably, November's APAC Conference in San Francisco drove results with an estimated 41,000 citywide group room nights. Looking ahead to 2024, we have 3.1 million definite group room nights on the books, representing a 16% increase since the third quarter, putting us ahead of where we were this time last year."", 'Total group revenue pace is up 10% over the same time last year, driven by rate room nights and banquets. We continue to be encouraged by the ongoing strength of group business as evidenced by strong pace, lengthening booking windows and double digit citywide room night pace in key markets such as New Orleans, San Diego, Seattle and D.C. Shifting gears to margins. As expected, margin declines year-over-year were driven by increases in wages and benefits, fixed expenses as well as moderating attrition and cancellation revenues and impacts from Maui. Despite these headwinds, full year 2023 comparable hotel EBITDA margin was 30.1%, representing a 60 basis point increase over 2019. Our ability to achieve this margin expansion is a result of our efforts to redefine the operating model and is indicative of our strong execution, particularly when considering that total comparable hotel expenses have only grown 7% in the last four years and occupancy is still 8 points below 2019.', 'Turning to our outlook for 2024. The midpoint of our guidance contemplates a stable operating environment with continued improvement in group business, a continued gradual recovery in business transient, steady leisure transient demand and a continued evolution of demand on Maui as the island recovers from the recent wildfires. At the low end, we have assumed slower group pickup and softer leisure transient, and at the high end, we have assumed a faster recovery at our Maui Resort and increased group pickup. For full year 2024, we anticipate comparable hotel RevPAR growth of between 2.5% and 5.5% over 2023. We expect comparable hotel EBITDA margins to be down 120 basis points year-over-year at the low end of our guidance to down 40 basis points at the high end.', 'Notably, we expect margins to be down only 20 basis points at the midpoint versus 2019 despite a 50 basis point margin impact from Maui. In terms of RevPAR growth cadence for the year, we expect comparable hotel RevPAR growth to be in the low single digits in the first half of the year due to tough comparisons to 2023, which saw a surge in recovery of downtown markets driven by improving group business and elevated leisure demand. We expect mid-single digit comparable hotel RevPAR growth in the second half of the year as a result of strong group booking pace, less renovation disruption compared to the second half of 2023 and the diminishing impact of the Maui wildfires. For January, we expect comparable hotel RevPAR to be approximately $187, a 1.4% improvement over 2023.', 'At the midpoint of our guidance range, we anticipate comparable hotel RevPAR growth of 4% compared to 2023 and a comparable hotel EBITDA margin of 29.3%, which is 80 basis points below 2023. As we think about bridging our 2023 results to 2024, we estimate that Maui is impacting comparable hotel RevPAR by 100 basis points and comparable hotel EBITDA margin by 50 basis points. We also expect a 15 basis point impact to margins from moderating attrition and cancellation revenues and a 45 basis point impact from property taxes and insurance. In 2024, we expect wage rates to increase approximately 5%. For context, in 2023, wages and benefits comprised approximately 50% of our total comparable hotel expenses and attrition and cancellation revenues were $75 million, which is approximately 50% higher than 2019.', 'Our 2024 full year adjusted EBITDAre midpoint is $1,635 million, this includes an expected additional $10 million from business interruption proceeds related to Hurricane Ian and an estimated $60 million contribution from operations at the Ritz-Carlton, Naples, which is excluded from our comparable hotel set in 2024. It is important to note that we have not included any assumption for business interruption proceeds from the Maui wildfires in our 2024 guidance. Turning to our balance sheet and liquidity position, our weighted average maturity is 4.2 years at a weighted average interest rate of 4.5%. We have a balanced maturity schedule with our next maturity of $400 million coming due in April 2024. We are closely monitoring the debt capital markets and we believe our balance sheet provides us with optionality and flexibility.', 'As Jim noted, we have $2.9 billion in total available liquidity, which includes $217 million of FF&E reserves and full availability of our $1.5 billion credit facility. We ended 2023 at 1.9x net leverage, and since our last call, Fitch upgraded the company’s issuer rating from BBB- to BBB with a stable outlook, returning Host to its pre-pandemic rating level. Wrapping up. In January we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share and a special dividend of $0.25, returning to our pre-pandemic quarterly payout level. The Board of Directors authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 on our common stock to be paid on April 15, 2024 to stockholders of record on March 28, 2024. As always, future dividends are subject to approval by the company’s Board of Directors.', 'To conclude, we are proud of our achievements in 2023 and we believe our best-in-class portfolio and balance sheet leave us uniquely positioned to capitalize on opportunities for growth in the future. With that, we would be happy to take your questions. To ensure we have time to address as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question.', 'See also 20 Fastest Growing Biotech Companies in the US and Jim Cramer’s 2024 Portfolio: 10 Latest Stock Picks.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

Strong pricing power has also been working well for tobacco players.These upsides have been helping companies navigate a tough industry landscape, wherein inflation has impacted Adult Tobacco Consumers’ (“ATC”) spending patterns, thereby affecting companies’ volumes. All said, Philip Morris International Inc. PM, Altria Group, Inc. MO and 22nd Century Group, Inc. XXII appear to be well-placed for growth.', 'About the Industry ', 'The Zacks Tobacco industry includes companies that manufacture and sell cigarettes as well as tobacco and nicotine-based products, such as cigars, snuffs and oral tobacco. Some companies also offer RRPs, such as e-cigarettes, vaping and heat-not-burn variants. A few of the firms are engaged in making devices and attachments needed in vaping and heat-not-burn products. Most products manufactured by the tobacco industry participants fall under the strict vigilance of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and are required to follow the permissible levels of nicotine in manufacturing. Players in this space sell products mostly through large retailers, distributors, convenience stores, drugstores, wholesalers and grocery chains. Additionally, some international tobacco firms operate in the country through subsidiaries.', '4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Tobacco Industry', 'Pricing Power: Players in the tobacco industry have been leveraging the strong pricing influence of tobacco products, which also helps them make up for high taxes and soft cigarette sales volumes. Since smokers tend to be less responsive to price hikes due to their addiction, this approach is anticipated to continue benefiting companies within the tobacco sector. The prudent pricing of cigarettes has been supporting the revenues of players in the tobacco industry in the face of declining volumes.Smoke-Free Products Gain Prominence: Rising health consciousness and stringent government regulations aimed at reducing cigarette smoking have driven many consumers toward reduced-risk products (RRPs) or smoke-free alternatives. These products are promoted as having a less adverse impact on health due to their scientific composition and way of consumption. An increasing number of consumers are turning to these alternatives as a means to quit smoking traditional cigarettes. Major players in the tobacco industry have been allocating resources to expand their presence in this category, including investing in innovations to make these products more user-friendly and energy-efficient. Companies have been experiencing significant revenue growth in the RRP or smoke-free product space. Philip Morris and British American Tobacco have been proactively working toward transitioning into predominantly smoke-free companies in the coming years. The resilience of these products is likely to continue delivering favorable outcomes for industry participants as they undergo business transformations.Cigarette Volume Concerns: The industry is battling challenges related to the inflationary environment, which has influenced consumer spending habits. Given the ever-changing external landscape, economic factors like inflation, increased interest rates, global supply-chain hurdles and ATC dynamics, such as purchasing patterns, the adoption of smoke-free products and disposable income, are likely to impact cigarette sales volumes. Further, cigarette volumes have been affected by strict government regulations pertaining to sales, marketing and manufacturing. Such regulatory norms are imposed due to health hazards caused by the consumption of nicotine. Some guidelines issued by the FDA include the mandatory use of precautionary labels on cigarette packets and self-critical advertisements. As cigarette sales constitute a significant portion of revenues for tobacco industry companies, the decrease in sales volumes within this category raises concerns.Cost Pressures: The performance of numerous industry participants has been adversely affected by cost inflation. Global inflationary challenges linked to essential materials such as tobacco leaf, energy and labor costs have been a worry. Elevated expenses related to the research, development and marketplace activities of smoke-free products further present risks to profit margins.', 'Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Good Prospects', 'The Zacks Tobacco industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Staples sector.

As a leading global financial institution, GS operates through three main business segments: Global Banking & Markets, Asset & Wealth Management, and Platform Solutions. The firm's financial performance reflects a balanced revenue mix, with approximately 20% from investment banking, 45% from trading, 20% from asset management, and 15% from wealth management and retail financial services. Geographically, GS generates around 60% of its net revenue from the Americas, 15% from Asia, and 25% from Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. With an aggregate market value of common stock held by non-affiliates at approximately $106.2 billion as of June 30, 2023, and 325.56 million shares of common stock outstanding as of February 9, 2024, GS's financial standing remains robust. This SWOT analysis delves into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as revealed by the latest SEC filing, providing investors with a nuanced understanding of GS's strategic position."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with GS.', ""Global Presence and Diversified Services: The Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS) boasts a formidable global footprint, with significant operations across the Americas, Asia, and EMEA. This geographical diversity not only mitigates the risks associated with market-specific downturns but also allows GS to tap into growth opportunities across different economies. The firm's diversified service offerings, spanning from investment banking to asset management, provide multiple revenue streams, which is a testament to its resilience against economic fluctuations. In 2023, GS's Global Banking & Markets segment continued to foster long-term relationships with institutional clients, reinforcing its market-making capabilities and advisory services. The Asset & Wealth Management segment managed a wide range of assets, offering investment products to both institutional and individual clients, further solidifying GS's position as a comprehensive financial services provider."", ""Technological Innovation and Client Connectivity: GS's commitment to technological innovation is a significant strength, as evidenced by its investment in platforms like Marquee, which offers institutional investors market intelligence, risk analytics, and trade execution. This focus on technology enhances client connectivity and provides a competitive edge by streamlining operations and improving the client experience. Moreover, the firm's Global Investment Research business maintains a strong research foundation, covering approximately 3,000 companies and 50 national economies, which underpins its advisory and market-making activities with data-driven insights."", ""Regulatory and Compliance Burdens: As a systemically important financial institution, GS faces extensive regulatory scrutiny across multiple jurisdictions. Compliance with evolving regulations requires significant resources and can impact profitability. The firm's 10-K filing acknowledges the challenges of adhering to complex laws and regulations, which necessitate interpretive decisions that could affect business operations and the ability to meet regulatory requirements such as capital or liquidity mandates. The need for ongoing investment in compliance infrastructure and personnel could potentially constrain GS's operational flexibility and financial performance."", 'Competitive and Pricing Pressures: The financial services industry is characterized by intense competition, and GS is not immune to the pressures that come with it. The firm competes with a broad range of financial institutions, from large global banks to specialized boutique firms. As highlighted in the filing, competitors may offer more favorable transaction execution, innovative products, or better client experiences. Additionally, the trend toward electronic and low-commission trading has led to pricing pressures, particularly in market-making and asset management services, which could erode profit margins if not effectively managed.', ""Strategic Partnerships and Market Expansion: GS has the opportunity to expand its market share and enhance its service offerings through strategic partnerships and acquisitions. The firm's recent initiatives, such as One Million Black Women and 10,000 Small Businesses, demonstrate its commitment to inclusive growth and community engagement. These programs not only contribute to societal development but also open new avenues for business expansion. Furthermore, GS's Platform Solutions segment, which includes consumer platforms and transaction banking, presents opportunities for growth in the digital banking and fintech sectors, areas that are witnessing rapid innovation and customer adoption."", ""Adaptation to Industry Trends: The financial industry is undergoing significant transformation, driven by technological advancements and changing consumer preferences. GS's ability to adapt to these trends, such as the increasing demand for sustainable and impact investing, positions the firm to capture emerging market opportunities. The firm's sustainability strategy, which emphasizes diversity and inclusion, aligns with broader societal shifts and can attract clients who prioritize corporate responsibility in their investment decisions."", ""Market Volatility and Economic Uncertainty: GS operates in an environment where market volatility and economic uncertainty can significantly impact its business segments. Fluctuations in interest rates, currency exchange rates, and commodity prices can affect the firm's trading and investment banking activities. Additionally, geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic factors, such as inflation and recessionary risks, pose threats to GS's global operations and financial stability."", ""Legal and Regulatory Risks: The 10-K filing underscores the legal and regulatory risks that GS faces, including potential fines, sanctions, and restrictions on business activities. Changes in laws or regulations, particularly those that disproportionately affect financial institutions, could adversely impact GS's competitive position and profitability. Moreover, the firm must navigate the complexities of operating in multiple regulatory regimes,"", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Together, these three FAANG stocks account for about 8.1% of the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) index's cap-weighted score -- and all three look ready to run in 2024."", ""When these giants dance, you can feel it all over Wall Street. So let's take a look at what they have going on in 2024 and beyond."", ""Google's parent company is hitching its wagon to the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Some critics expect the company to lose a significant amount of online search and advertising business to AI tools such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, but Alphabet isn't sitting on its digital hands."", 'For instance, Google recently upgraded and renamed its ChatGPT-like Bard tool. Now known as Google Gemini, the subscription-style Advanced version has analytic and mock-creative powers comparable to ChatGPT.', ""Google is also integrating the Gemini AI model into popular online services like Gmail and Google Docs, while ChatGPT must rely on Microsoft to add similar AI functionality into Office 365, Outlook, and Bing. In my eyes, Google's access to mountains of valuable user data gives it a hard-to-beat competitive advantage that should make AI more of an opportunity than a challenge."", ""Furthermore, Alphabet's stock is still under pressure from the sector-wide downturn in digital advertising. High inflation and rising federal interest rates made consumers hold on to their wallets tighter, which led to lower interest in generous advertising campaigns. Big marketing budgets just don't make sense when no one is ready to buy your products."", ""I expect an impressive swing in that industry's fortunes before long. The inflation panic is fading out, and regulators are ready to lower interest rates this year -- and all those ad buyers with limited budgets have a couple of years' worth of innovation and product development to share with a more receptive consumer market."", ""With the economic environment poised for improvement, Alphabet's advertising segment is set to rebound, benefiting from deferred marketing investments ready to be unleashed. At the same time, the company is grabbing the AI challenge by the horns and twisting it in a helpful direction. This confluence of technological leadership and improving market health offers a prime opportunity for Alphabet to accelerate growth."", ""Accounting for 3.8% of the S&P 500's overall score, Alphabet is one of the market barometer's largest difference-makers. So when you see reports of the bull market's progress, this stock plays a leading role in those market trends."", 'The e-commerce and cloud computing giant taps into the same economic opportunities as Alphabet, but from a distinctly different angle.', ""The recovery in Amazon's e-commerce business is already well underway. North American retail sales rose 13% year over year in the recently reported holiday quarter of 2023. International e-commerce sales increased by 17%. Operating profits are up, and Amazon is collecting robust cash flows after a deep, dark inflation lull."", ""And that bullish trend doesn't even account for the star of the Amazon show -- Amazon Web Services (AWS)."", 'This incredibly lucrative business saw 13% revenue growth but a 38% jump in operating profits. AI services helped AWS deliver these impressive profits. The earnings release included 12 examples of large AWS deals executed in the fourth quarter, and 10 of them included an AI component.', ""The company takes advantage of the generative AI frenzy in three distinct layers. The platform's AI accelerators help customers build and train the AI engines behind their chatbots and large language models (LLMs). AWS also provides access to existing LLMs through the Bedrock service. Finally, the Amazon Q tool (so recently launched that it's still in limited preview mode) offers a ChatGPT-like interface with Amazon's catalog of AI products."", ""As a leading provider of cloud-based computing services on a global scale, you should expect Amazon to make a mint from this multilayered approach to the AI opportunity. Paired with the e-commerce recovery, Amazon's stock should pull its considerable weight for the S&P 500 in 2024. Its market cap is a rounding error away from Alphabet's, resulting in an equal-sized 3.8% share of the market index."", ""These massive workhorses have a lot of work to do in this bull run. I'm sure they're up to the task, though."", 'Netflix is a smaller business, with a more modest 0.5% impact on the S&P 500 index. However, a top-30 position in the index is nothing to sneeze at, and I think the media-streaming veteran is poised to climb the ranks over the next couple of years.', ""You're looking at a long-term growth stock in the middle of an important strategy shift. Last year, co-founder and longtime CEO Reed Hastings handed off Netflix's reins to two trusted lieutenants -- former content chief Ted Sarandos and chief operating officer Greg Peters. Under the new regime, Netflix is shifting its business model. Formerly chasing subscriber growth at pretty much any cost, the company now aims for profitable revenue growth and richer free cash flows instead."", ""The new plan includes a few formerly controversial ideas. Subscribers now have access to a lower-priced access plan supported by commercials. The company is cracking down on password-sharing. There's even a video game business in the works, currently going through the paces of offering free games to video subscribers, but probably gearing up to deliver a separate revenue stream fairly soon."", ""Investors didn't love the updated business plan at first, sending Netflix's stock straight to Wall Street's bargain bin in 2022. However, after a steady stream of good-looking updates on the impact of ad-based plans and password-sharing conversions, the Netflix bears are calming down."", 'The stock chart is pointing skyward, with a 65% gain over the last year, but Netflix still looks undervalued. The company is more profitable than ever, with even greater bottom-line ambitions in the long run. In 2024 and 2025, Netflix needs to convince skeptical investors that the new profit focus is a good idea -- much like it had to sell investors on the new media-streaming focus in 2011 and 2012.', ""That's why I expect Netflix to rebuild investor confidence and boost shareholder returns this year.

If you would like to skip our detailed analysis of the board game industry, you can directly go to the 5 Best Board Games for Families.', 'Technology may have replaced multiple entertainment avenues, but board games have managed to hold out for a long time. According to Fortune Business Insights, the global board games industry was valued at $11.08 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow to $26.04 billion by 2030, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.36% over the projected period. While most publications credit the 2020 lockdowns for this growth and revival of the board gaming industry, the market has flourished due to a myriad of other pertinent factors as well. As relevant as the ‘pandemic effect’ is, board games have managed to stay in the limelight through a culmination of several reasons, many of which were revealing their impacts even before the COVID-19 lockdowns.\xa0', 'One of the most significant impacts has been generated by the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter, which has brought publishing access to indie game designers without needing hefty funding. According to the company’s own data, over 84,000 gaming projects have been launched on the platform since it began in 2009, out of which 40,892 have already reached their funding goal. Kickstarter allows gaming enthusiasts to get early access to exclusive games and enables customers to have a say in the design and subsequent updates. This feedback-mechanism model results in games that are conducive to public demand and responsive to the gamers’ needs. More than 2,300 board gaming projects are about to begin their funding on Kickstarter in the coming months. Gaming connoisseurs can also look at the 15 Best Video Games Coming Out in 2024.\xa0', 'Kickstarter is not the only platform making waves in this space; even newbies like Gamefound are generating a considerable impact. Despite being relatively new in the space, the company generated $56 million in board gaming funding in 2023, as per data shared by Polygon. When this is added to the $226.2 million revenue that Kickstart engendered, 2023 can be considered one of the top years for board gaming. Gamefound’s most funded game of 2023 was Nemesis: Retaliation, which generated around $12 million. Several other games raised funds in the $1-4 million bracket.\xa0', 'Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter have helped a plethora of creative projects that might not have been economically feasible otherwise, and they have also led to a rise in the popularity of board game-specific YouTube channels, such as Games4Two and The Dice Tower. As themed and niche board games become more accessible to the everyday consumer; people have something to look forward to in the gaming space. The world’s largest board gaming convention, Internationale Spieltage SPIEL, or the Essen Game Fair, launched over 1,000 games during its 2023 iteration alone, welcoming 193,000 gamers from 85 countries. As board gamers gather for four days to try out hundreds of new games, one idea is reiterated repeatedly: in the 21st century, board games are more than just dice rolls and luck-based turns.\xa0', ""Gaming giants like Hasbro Inc (NASDAQ:HAS) have been at the forefront of benefitting from the rising trend of themed board games. To ensure people don’t get tired of playing the same version of Monopoly, Hasbro Inc (NASDAQ:HAS) has created over 50 variations of the classic game, including special editions dedicated to Fortnite, Star Wars, and Game of Thrones. Another classic by Hasbro Inc (NASDAQ:HAS), Dungeons & Dragons, will be celebrating its 50th anniversary in 2024, for which the company has planned a year-long celebration beginning in March. According to a company statement published on February 12, the company will be holding events worldwide, offering unique experiences inspired by the game's history. Rich and dynamic events like these enable classic games to stay hyped even years after their original release.\xa0"", ""The popularity of DnD also points to another rising phenomenon in the board game industry: the role of media. Stranger Things came out in July of 2016 on Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), bearing a premise based around the classic role-player game, which many also consider the first of its type. According to the Daily Dot, Google searches for DnD rose 20% during the show's first two seasons and another 50% during later seasons. The creators behind the game also came out with a DnD Stranger Things tie-in version in 2019, just before the show’s third season aired. This unlikely connection between modern media and an older form of entertainment might be surprising, but it has worked wonders for classic games like this one.\xa0You can also read about the best fighting video games of all time."", ""Building onto our previous example, DnD is not the only board game that has witnessed a boost due to a popular TV show. According to Fortune Business Insights, chess sales by Goliath Games were up 1,000% in November 2020, while chess sales on eBay witnessed a 215% growth around the same time. These drastic numbers were the product of the Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) series The Queen’s Gambit, which came out in October 2020. Another report by the Michigan Journal of Economics states that Chess.com, a popular online site for the game, added a whopping 2.8 million member accounts following the show's release. Thus, in a span of five years, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) contributed to massive growth in two classic board games, which had otherwise become pretty niche.\xa0"", 'At the end of the day, one of the biggest changes in the board game industry is the addition of diversity. It was harder to feign interest in tabletop gaming when the only available options were the same games that had been on the market for decades, but today, there are new experiences to invest in every day. On top of that, there is a game for every age bracket, interest, and group size. Board games span themes of every category, from communicating with ‘ghosts’ to trading on the stock floor - which means that even those interested in real-world subject matters such as stock trading, real estate, or financial markets, can find tabletop games suited to their passions.\xa0', 'Games such as Acquire, Panic on Wall Street, and Raccoon Tycoon are some of the leaders in this category. The fact that these board games are also accessible to younger teens means they can even be enjoyed by the whole family. The bottom line is that the gaming industry has expanded enough that games are not just limited to one avenue anymore. Because games exist on such a vast range of topics now, most people can find a point of entry into board gaming.', 'According to an article published by the Washington Post on December 24, 2022, Elan Lee, the creator of the popular card game Exploding Kittens, mentioned that while classic games are still popular, these new board game ideas have filled a hole in the industry. According to Lee and Rodney Smith, the founder of a YouTube channel dedicated to gaming, before, board games were mainly about brute competition, whereas today, several of them come with a cooperative gameplay mode. This essentially allows families to experience a different kind of gaming world together, enabling them to form memories.\xa0', ""All these changing industry trends have made board gaming a wholesome family experience again, leading to a rise in the demand for the best board games for families to enjoy together. Let's now take a look at the 30 best board games for families."", '30 Best Board Games for Families', 'Our Methodology', 'For the purpose of ranking the best board games for families, we looked through over 10 online rankings to develop a list of the 40 best games.

He didn’t even buy during the dark times of the financial crisis.This big purchase made headlines and was analyzed on Twitter and Stocktwits by stock investors.Insiders Buying En MasseBut what about when non-famous insiders buy their company’s stock and when a bunch of them buy en masse?This mass insider buying behavior is called a “cluster buy” and it is the strongest signal you can get in insider trading.When one insider buys, he might be considered an optimist, especially when he’s the CEO, but when four or five insiders all buy at the same time?Now that’s a powerful consensus.But you’re not going to hear about the cluster buys from the media. There aren’t going to be headlines trumpeting the buys of a few corporate Directors and a CFO.Nope. The cluster buy simply isn’t glamorous enough.Investors therefore have to dig below the surface to find the insider cluster buys. But once you do, that’s where big rewards can be found.Cluster Buying Sends the Strongest Signal Why do insiders spend so much of their money on their own companies’ stock when they already own a ton of shares already? Greed!Pure and simple.The opportunity to make more money motivates people- even people who are already well off like highly paid CEOs and CFOs.When insiders buy in a cluster, it’s because they all know something very good is going on at the company. Maybe it is a new product. Or contract. Or pending merger. Whatever the reason, they are all very confident that shares will be on the rise.After all, who would buy more stock in a company if they knew it was sinking?\xa0 And why would there be several of them buying unless they didn’t collectively believe that their stock was a value?When things at the company are THAT good, insiders don’t want to miss out when everyone else is cashing in. Call it insider peer pressure, if you will.Continued . . .------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------""These Insiders Know More Than We Do""Something’s up at several companies that already showed strong Zacks Rank fundamentals. Principal officers reported to the SEC (as required by law) that they put up their own money to purchase shares of their own stocks.There’s only one reason why those insiders would do that: They expect their stocks to go up in price.They know something we don’t. An expected contract? A product breakthrough? A planned merger? A brewing acquisition? Using our proprietary strategy, we find the soundest of these insider plays, and are now opening up our recommendations to public view – but only until Sunday, February 25.See Zacks selected insider trades now >>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Real Life Cluster BuyingShares of the oil producers crashed in the coronavirus sell-off in 2020 as oil prices plunged globally.They remained depressed over the summer of 2020 and into the fall even as crude prices rose back above $40 a barrel.The insiders at explorer Matador Resources saw an opportunity with their shares still in the single digits.In Nov 2020, 6 insiders including the CEO, the COO of Operations and 4 directors, dove in to buy again with 5 buying even before Pfizer’s big Nov 9, 2020 announcement that its vaccine was over 90% effective against the coronavirus.Pfizer’s announcement, and subsequent roll-out of its vaccine, lit a fire under the beaten down oil stocks. The rally continued into 2022 as energy prices spiked on the Ukraine War. Energy was the best performing S&P 500 sector in 2021 and 2022.From Dec 1, 2020 through Dec 30, 2022, shares of Matador surged 387%.Diving in Yet Again But 2023 brought yet further changes to market conditions, as crude and natural gas prices came back down off their Ukraine War highs.Shares of Matador fell to start 2023 and the insiders saw yet another buying opportunity. A cluster of 5 insiders bought shares in the spring of 2023, including the CEO, 2 directors, the EVP of Reservoir Engineering and the President-Operations.Recently, Matador saw record energy production in the fourth quarter 2023. But it sees even brighter days ahead. In 2024, the company expects a record year in energy production, with an 18% year-over-year average production increase.Shares of Matador are up 34% since Mar 17, 2023.What did the insiders know?Buy When the Insiders BuyWhen high level insiders buy, they are required to report the purchases to the SEC within 48 hours of the trade. The trade then becomes public information.Hedge funds and other professional investors routinely use this information to get an edge on their trades.For most of us, though, it’s not easy to get access to insider information.While the media will tout the huge insider buys from celebrity CEO’s like Reed Hastings’ Jan 2022 $20 million Netflix share purchase, you’ll almost never hear about the non-celebrity CEO’s, or other top ranked officers when they buy their stocks.Was anyone talking about the 2023 Matador cluster buy?The challenge is getting easy and reliable access to all the insider trades and then figuring out which ones to buy.Where to Find the Cluster BuysAnyone can go on the SEC website and get the insider trading information, but it’s time consuming to search by individual companies.Some investment firms collect the insider buying data and can provide it to you as a daily list. Have you ever seen one of those lists?\xa0 The sheer number of companies can be overwhelming.And those lists don’t usually separate out the cluster buys, which sometimes take place on different days in the same week.For example, if you’re getting daily insider updates, you may not realize that the CEO bought on Monday but three directors bought on Tuesday.

So far this earnings season key retailers though have cautioned about weakening sales trends, inflation still being a problem and pickier customers. While investors we are going to get a closer look at some of these spending trends next week with Lowe's Urban Outfitters TJX companies and Best Buy all scheduled to report."", ""Let's talk about what we could expect with Simeon Siegel. He's BMO Capital Markets managing director. Simeon, it's good to see you here. So when we think about the companies that have reported so far, there has been a trend of consumers once again trading down. They are clearly being hit by the fact that inflation has proven to be even stickier than many forecasters had anticipated up until this point. What does that mean for some of these retailers that are set to report next week?"", ""SIMEON SIEGEL: Hey, Seana, great to see you. By the way, you're reminding me how busy and painful next week is going to be. Thank you. So [INAUDIBLE]--"", ""SEANA SMITH: Just a friendly reminder ahead of the weekend. It's a great Friday reminder, that's great. So I think what is very interesting right now is there's an incredible amount of nuance at the company level. And in theory, that's a very encouraging thing if you're a stock picker. The problem is we can look at the market. And we can see what happened yesterday as an example. And there is so much of the stock trading dynamic, which is just market driven right now."", ""And so I'm looking at some of these businesses and saying, you know what? For the first time since the pandemic, companies actually have to execute. Well, you're watching certain companies drive revenues up, certain ones drive revenues down. You're watching certain companies see material gross margin expansion, others a lot less. And so that's really comforting. The problem is right now all my stocks are up."", ""And so when I look across the board, it's going to be very interesting next week seeing what matters, what people want to focus on. And I think that's your question. And so what I'm going to keep an eye on is the fact that so far my companies on average have seen revenues grow mid-single digits. But they've seen gross margins expand by 200 basis points. There's still this benefit from supply chain."", 'And so this is a very important quality of earnings story to keep in mind.', ""BRAD SMITH: When would you describe-- how would you describe the consumer amid this earnings season as well, Simeon? I mean, when you think about where the consumer is still willing to buy in at full prices versus where they're looking for deals and looking for value hacks."", ""SIMEON SIEGEL: Yeah. It's such an important question because we're all hearing the consumer-- listen, it sounds pretty scary. So if the question is whether consumer is healthy or not, I don't know.

And so I know there's this perception that because of inflation on staple items, people aren't buying discretionary. But I'm not seeing that in the results."", ""We are seeing revenues grow. And so I think that's this really fascinating conversation. As we look, listen, we'll see TJX give us a very good snapshot on people that are specifically looking for value. But then we'll see Birkenstock on the other hand where people are buying perhaps more comfortable spending up. So I think it's much more of a company specific. I think you give a consumer something that they want to spend on and they're willing to spend on it."", ""Whether that's healthy or not, that's a different conversation."", ""SEANA SMITH: Simeon, what does the promotional environment look like right now in terms of the channel checks that you've been seeing?

I think that the holiday trend probably will because the holiday trend showed certain companies promoting and certain ones not. And I think that's a really interesting example, like Bath & Body Works is going to report next week. I'm hoping that what they tell us is that they pulled back on promotions because they believe that they can drive a full price sell through."", ""That's a scented candle, it's not a big ticket item. But it's an item where people feel very passionate about and they're willing to spend. It's clearly a-- well, it's more discretionary than it is staple, though maybe some people would disagree. And so we've definitely been seeing promotions. We've been seeing the companies that need to drive demand. Resort to pulling that price lever."", ""But we've also been seeing plenty that are not. Talk about prices that are growing. And so I think that's what you want to see. If you're a retailer, if you're an operator, you want to know that the consumer is going to give you credit for items that they believe that you think have value there. And you do not need to drive promotions. But as we saw since 2008, the companies that don't have that, they go immediately to promotions. During the pandemic, we didn't see them, we definitely are seeing them now.""]"

Please go ahead."", ""Thomas Palmer: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. Please note our cautionary statement and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website. Today, I'm joined by my executive leadership team, including Natascha Viljoen and Karyn Ovelmen, and we'll all be available to answer your questions at the end of the call. I'd also like to take a moment to acknowledge our friend and colleague, Rob Atkinson, our Chief Operating Officer for the past 5 years, Rob will leave Newmont in early May, although his legacy will endure. Through his visible self-leadership, Rob has driven our fatality risk management program, achieving 5 years fatality-free performance. Throughout the pandemic, Rob navigated our operations through challenges, including periods of care and maintenance, order closures and vaccine implementation."", ""Rob also represented the very best of our values when he guided Peñasquito through 2 major challenges: resolving a community blockade in 2019 and an unjustified strike last year. In both situations, Rob found sustainable solutions that protected a long-term value of Newmont. Over the last 5 months, Rob and Natascha have conducted a thorough handover of accountabilities and Rob will remain with us to support [indiscernible] before finishing up and heading back to the U.K. to spend more time with family. Before we get started, it is with great sadness that I share the tragic news regarding a fatal incident at our recently acquired Brucejack operation on December 20 last year. I'd like to take a moment to remember our colleague Adam Kennedy. Adam was only 44 years old."", 'He was a partner, a son, a brother, and uncle, a best friend and a valued colleague. Our condolences go out to Adams loved ones during this difficult time, and we are again reminded how important it is to maintain a sense of chronic unease when it comes to the safety of everyone who works at Newmont. [indiscernible] fatality is totally unacceptable. We fully understand the fatality risk in our industry and the critical controls that need to be in place at all times to manage them. So we have been taking the time to conduct a safety reset across all Newmont sites, not just the 5 new Newmont operations with a laser focus on the implementation of our fatality risk management system. This reset work includes training delivered by our line leaders, our managing directors, our general managers and our senior health and safety leaders.', 'Training on our fatality risk management standards, and our critical control verification process. We are also concluding our thorough investigation into this tragic incident which is being led by David Thornton, the Managing Director of our Africa business unit. We are applying the lessons learned from this investigation at all of our managed operations globally and we will share them widely with our mining industry peers. Nothing is more important that our commitment to the health and safety of our workforce, and we are determined to create an environment with every person working at Newmont across all locations return home safe and well to their families and loved ones at the end of each and every shift. Turning to our performance in 2023.', 'Newmont finished the year with a solid fourth quarter, putting us in line with the revised stand-alone outlook that we issued following the resolution of the strike at Peñasquito. In summary, we produced 5.5 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $1,444 an ounce. In addition to gold, we produced nearly 900,000 gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead and zinc over the course of the year. This performance enabled us to deliver $4.2 billion in adjusted EBITDA returned the $1.4 million to shareholders and end the year with liquidity above $6 billion. In a few minutes Natascha and I will explain on how we expect to improve upon this performance in 2024 and beyond, with a focus of delivering meaningful value to our shareholders.', ""But before we do that, I would like to describe how we're transforming our business into a unique collection of the world's best gold and copper operations and projects following last year's transaction. When we announced our binding agreement to acquire Newcrest in May last year, we outlined a powerful value proposition built around 4 key commitments. First, to set the new sustainability standard and strengthened Newmont's position as the gold sector recognize sustainability leader. Second, to create the industry's strongest portfolio of world-class gold and copper assets in the most favorable mining jurisdictions. Third, to deliver $500 million of annual synergies and realize over $2 billion in cash from portfolio optimization. And finally, to continue driving a disciplined, balanced approach to capital allocation."", ""After closing the transaction on November 6 last year, the integration of the 5 new operations into our Newmont operating model has been progressing very well. And as we enter this critically important year of integration and transformation, I'll be holding myself and my executive leadership team accountable for delivering on these commitments and this will be our key focus in 2024. To support this work, earlier today, we announced 4 key actions that together will enhance our ability to deliver on our clear and consistent strategy. First, we plan to divest 6 high-quality but noncore assets this year. From this point forward, our world-class portfolio will consist entirely of Tier 1, an emerging Tier 1 operations and districts. And it will have a significant exposure to growth in copper and gold from our industry-leading organic project pipeline."", ""Second, we provided our 2024 and 5-year outlook, getting a clear picture of the work we're doing today to expand margins and appropriately sequence our projects to deliver sustainable value. Third, with the clarity, simplicity and focus that our Tier 1 portfolio provides, we have committed to deliver a further $500 million in cost and productivity improvements across the entire portfolio. And these improvements are over and above our synergy commitment from the Newcrest acquisition. We expect to hit this $500 million annual run rate of improvement by the end of 2025. And finally, we announced a balanced shareholder return framework, consisting of $1 per share annualized base dividend and a new $1 billion share repurchase program. Our go-forward Newmont portfolio is focused on Tier 1, gold and copper, operations and projects located in the world's most favorable mining jurisdictions."", ""And it has 4 key features. First, it contains 10 Tier 1 operations, representing all the half of the world Tier 1 guidelines in the Newmont portfolio. Second, it has 3 emerging Tier 1 operations that each has a clear path for growth. And we have the opportunity to create a Tier 1 district in British Columbia, a district in which Newmont will be operating for at least the next [indiscernible]. And third, it has an unmatched organic development pipeline with 6 large-scale top of gold projects. And fourth, underpinning our Tier 1 portfolio, is the industry's most robust foundation of reserves and resources. Going forward, Newmont has the industry's largest gold resource base and we also have the largest base of copper resources in the gold industry."", ""To put these numbers into perspective, Newmont has an almost 30% large gold reserve resource base than our nearest peer. And we have a 40% larger copper reserve resource base than our nearest gold peer. No other gold producing in the world can offer the depth and quality that Newmont's Tier 1 portfolio can today. Later on, I'll provide a little bit more color about Newmont's longer-term outlook and the exciting gold, copper opportunities ahead of us. But first, I'd like to step back and give some insight into how we are framing the year ahead. 2023 brought with a number of unique challenges, which are now certainly behind us. The 120-day labor dispute at Peñasquito, asset integrity issues that were inherent in the original design of equipment at Ahafo and wildfires in Canada impacting Éléonore."", ""Those 3 events, mean that our final production number did not reflect the full capability of our assets. As we emerge on the other side of these events, I am proud of the decisions that we took to protect the long-term interest of our company rather than looking to seek short-term experience solutions. However, I'm also not happy with the underlying level of our operating performance. We have the opportunity to improve our compliance to mine plants to improve our fixed and mobile equipment reliability and to improve our mill throughputs and recoveries. So our focus to '24 will be on safely integrating new teams, new operations in our Newmont operating model and culture, transforming our portfolio, underlying the groundwork for sustainable operating performance, margin expansion and strong returns."", 'Finally, this morning, we also announced that we have extended the completion date and increased the project capital cost for our Tanami 2 expansion project. In the second half of last year, we completed the concrete lining of the top half or 700 meters of this 1.5 kilometer deep production shaft. This milestone gave us the opportunity to assess the condition of the known overbreak and ground conditions at the very bottom of the shaft as well as incorporate the lessons learned providing the top half of the shaft into the cost and schedule for the run home. We have critically assessed a number of options to safely address the line overbreak and line the lower section of the shaft. This work included key third-party reviews before we landed on a method.', ""And it was this methodology and subsequent decision that an informed the cost and schedule update we provided today. Although I'm not happy with the extension of time and cost, I am confident that we have chosen a method that is safe and will ensure the shaft construction is of the quality necessary to rely with service Tanami prolific ore body for many, many years to come. So with that, I'll hand it over to Natascha to walk you through our operational priorities in 2024 and what we are doing to ensure that we deliver on our commitments this year. Over to you, Natascha."", ""Natascha Viljoen: Thank you, Tom, and good morning. Since joining Newmont in October, I have visited 14 of Newmont's 17 managed operations. And I've been really impressed by the quality of the assets, the dedication of our people and the commitment from our operational leaders to drive safe and profitable production. Now before I begin, I'd like to provide a brief introduction to the operational team focused on integration and value delivery in 2024. As mentioned last quarter, within our global operating model, we have 6 regional business units, each headed up by a world-class experienced Newmont leader where you can see on this slide. This scalable integrated operating model enables alignment across our operating leadership team while also empowering our managing directors to apply the extensive local and technical knowledge and draw on the global functional expertise to lead each unique operation."", 'To support our operations from the project execution side, we have a dedicated restructured project delivery team. This team of subject matter experts is working across the full spectrum of our organic pipeline, including studies, project development, construction and commissioning of projects. By strengthen our operating model with block driving capability and an understanding of industry-leading practices in project development. This year, we will have a laser focus on the performance of our 11 managed operations in our go-forward portfolio, while also guiding our 6 noncore assets through a safe and productive process for divestment. As we work to deliver efficiency and reliability from our global portfolio, we are committed to progressing our 4 key projects in execution and keeping them on track in 2024.', ""As a result, we are entering the year with a strong focus on integration and the safe delivery of our targets. Our success in 2024 will be largely determined by the performance of our 6 managed Tier 1 operations, Boddington, Tanami, Penasquito, Ahafo, Lihir and Cadia, not underestimating the significant impact of the delivery from the full portfolio of operating assets. I will also separately touch on telephone and how we are ensuring [indiscernible] integrity at this new to Newmont operation. We're very clear on the key priorities to integrate and deliver 2024 and how this set up operations in the next 5 years. And I will touch on some of these in each of the Tier 1 managed operations. At Boddington, we are progressing the stripping of the current laybacks in the North and South pits as planned, with improved productivity from our fully autonomous [indiscernible] fleet."", 'At our poly metallic mine Peñasquito, our focus is on delivering strong silver, lead and zinc from the Chile Colorado pit, and continuing wide stripping in the Peñasco pit to deliver higher gold grade in 2025. At Ahafo, we remain on track to replacement girth gear in the second quarter to maximize [indiscernible] rates. At Tanami, we are improving material movement through the decline as we progress deeper underground. [indiscernible] team will be focused on simplifying the mine plan and improving asset reliability. And at our other Newmont operation Cadia, we are commissioning the next block cave and progressing some important tailings rectification and expansion work to sync up for the next decade of all feed. We have full potential teams on the ground at coherent Cadia, actively working through our diagnosis phase and designing the initiatives to extract value and deliver the opportunities identified.', ""So taking these key priorities into account, we anticipate that the production will be around 53% weighted towards the second half of the year as we return to full pricing rates at Ahafo, reach higher grades for the liberator ore body at Tanami and site integrated due to Newmont sites into the Newmont operating model. I'm touching briefly on Telfer, a noncore operation in Australia. We are focused on remediating [indiscernible] and fracs detected at the tailing storage facility in December, where we stopped the mill to complete the first phase of remediation work. In early February, we temporarily restarted the plant while evaluating options for further remediation of an [indiscernible] tailing facility and we'll provide an update on that work on our first quarter earnings call."", 'And with a focus on fatality risk management, we expect that work and full potential implies, we remind fairly on track to deliver on our commitments this year. On top of delevering in 2024 operationally, we are working to bring forward new low-cost ounces from the 4 key projects we have in execution. These projects include the second expansion at Tanami, as Tom just covered. Our focus is on slightly aligning the lower section of the shaft and continuing to construct and crushing and combined infrastructure underground. Two block cave projects at Cadia to recover both gold and copper, where we have just let first ore as we ramp up the first of these caves. And our new mine, Ahafo North, where we are making good progress on the construction of the [indiscernible] and other supporting infrastructure, along with wire stripping to allow us to start accessing the ore for stockpiling.', ""When this new and very exciting mine is combined with the underground potential of Subika, Apensu and Awonsu, we have a Tier 1 Ahafo district and we'll be capable of producing around 850,000 ounces of gold per year out to and beyond 2015, which would make it one of the world's top gold mining districts by any measure. Now bringing all of this together, as we focus on the integration and size delivering this year, we expect our Tier 1 portfolio to produce around 5.6 million ounces of gold and an all-in sustaining cost of $1,300 per ounce. Combined with the very significant 1.9 million gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead, zinc and molybdenum. Our unit costs are expected to improve compared to 2023 due to steady production of net volumes and the delivery of synergies and full potential improvements with the lowest unit cost coming from Newmont's managed Tier 1 portfolio."", ""Our capital reinvestments remains in line with the pre-acquisition spending levels as we continue to focus our disciplined delivery and a balanced approach to capital allocation. And with a stable reduction and structured reinvestment, we are strongly positioned to integrate and deliver on our commitments in 2024, setting the stage to future proof these world-class assets with benchmark performance and meaningful growth in 2025 and beyond. And with that, I'll turn it back to Tom."", ""Thomas Palmer: Thanks, Natascha. Moving up to foundation we are establishing in 2024 that Natascha just covered. I'd now like to provide a bit of color around the opportunities that we are seeing from our go-forward portfolio. We will continue to optimize the performance of our mature Tier 1 operations and our new to Newmont assets. At Boddington, the stripping that we are doing today will bring forward strong gold and copper grades starting in 2026, all supported by the gold industry's only fully autonomous whole fleet. At Tanami, the completion of the second expansion will provide efficient access to ore at depth and open up this prolific underground ore body in 2027 and beyond. At Penasquito, the stripping that we are currently doing will bring forward a harder proportion of gold ounces from the Penasco pit, balancing with the strong production of silver, lead and zinc from the Chile Colorado pit."", 'At Ahafo, we are building out district potential with new low-cost ounces from both underground and open pit at Ahafo South, and our new mine, Ahafo North coming online in 2025. At Cadia, we will commission our second block cave in this time frame bringing forward higher gold and copper grades whilst in parallel, leveraging our full potential program to improve their reliability and throughput. And finally, simplifying the [indiscernible] mine plan is expected to deliver a strong improvement in gold production as we reach higher grades from Phase 14a. As I mentioned earlier, with a clear line of sight into the Tier 1 managed operations in our portfolio, we have identified $500 million of additional cost and productivity improvements over and above our synergy commitments.', 'So taking everything into account. Over the next 5 years, we expect to deliver growing gold production driven by the completion of the laybacks at both Boddington and Peñasquito, the new ounces from Ahafo North, the completion of the second expansion at Tanami and both block caves at Cadia and binding improvements combined with higher grades [indiscernible]. And on top of this improving gold production, Newmont will produce a significant amount of copper, along with silver, lead, zinc and molybdenum with our global diversified Tier 1 portfolio. Driven by this high metal production and with a focus on improving costs, we expect to deliver all-in sustaining costs bringing our go-forward portfolio down to $1,150 per ounce by 2027. For development capital, we are applying a pragmatic and methodical approach to our project work to ensure we are efficiently bringing forward opportunities that are aligned with our strategy, also remaining disciplined with our capital allocation priorities.', 'We expect to spend an average of $1.3 billion per year on development capital, driving healthy competition for investment has been closed out all large projects we have in execution and bring forward the next wave of profitable production from our organic project pipeline. Newmont is supported by the deepest and best project pipeline in the gold industry and we will manage it with discipline and rigor to ensure that the most value-accretive opportunities are advanced at the right time and to the right order. We have 3 world-class copper, gold projects in our pipeline ramped up behind the 4 projects we have currently in execution. Moving underground with the block cave at Red Chris developing the [indiscernible] block cave and processing the sulfide ore at Yanacocha.', ""And then when we look beyond those projects, we have 3 exciting long-term opportunities to further diversify into copper, Galore Creek, Pueblo Viejo and Norte Abierto. Over the next 10 years, the amount of copper is expected to increase significantly. And based on current copper production trends, the world can expect to experience around a 10 million tonne shortfall on this critical metal by 2035. Bridging this gap will require significantly more copper mines, copper recycling and enhanced copper hedging processes, creating an exciting opportunity to Newmont to help meet this demand with the organic copper exposure we have in our portfolio, whilst continuing to provide unparalleled exposure to gold and its enduring value. And with that, I'll hand it over to Karyn to talk through our balanced capital allocation strategy."", 'Karyn Ovelmen: Thank you, Tom. Our capital allocation strategy is underpinned by 3 priorities: working in [indiscernible], these priorities maintain the financial flexibility necessary to reinvest in our business with the goal of generating long-term sustainable free cash flow, in turn, positioning us to return capital to shareholders through our balanced shareholder return framework. Beginning with financial flexibility, the first of our 3 priorities. We intend to maintain an investment-grade balance sheet with gross debt of up to $8 million and liquidity of $7 billion, including approximately $3 billion of cash. And by maintaining a strong balance sheet, we can ensure we have the ability to steadily fund cash-generative capital projects, all while returning capital to shareholders.', 'As announced this morning, we have 6 assets currently classified as non-core. The anticipated proceeds from these divestments, along with free cash flow from operations, will cycle through our capital allocation priorities beginning with enhancing our financial strength and flexibility. Divestiture proceeds will first be allocated to maintaining our minimum cash balance of approximately $3 billion and will then be applied to reducing debt to $8 million or below. Our initial debt target of $8 billion is to achieve return -- we intend to return both free cash flow from operations and divestiture proceeds to our shareholders, which I will touch on in more detail in a minute. Moving to sustainable investments. As Tom and Natascha mentioned, over the next 5 years, we expect meaningful production growth from a volume wise, low-cost operations as we invest an average of $1.3 billion of development capital into projects that will generate the highest returns.', 'The third priority of our capital allocation approach is a balanced shareholder return framework designed to return capital to shareholders through our base dividend and share repurchases. To be clear, we are not yet where we want to be in terms of generating free cash flow to return to our shareholders, but I believe we have the right framework in place to return an increasing amount of capital as our operational and financial performance improves. Our balanced shareholder return framework begins with an annualized base dividend of $1 per share, an amount that will remain fixed and currently equates to a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share. We expect to be able to pay the base dividend from free cash flow over time. Our dividend is subject to approval from our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis.', 'Historically, our free cash flow generation has been weighted towards the back end of the year, and we expect that will be the case in 2024 as our production profile and synergy realization is expected to be higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year. In addition, free cash flow generation in the first quarter of 2024 will be impacted by the payment of safe duty tax related to the acquisition of Newcrest. Stamp duty was accrued in the fourth quarter and paid in February. As necessary, we will use the flexibility of our balance sheet from the base dividend through the quarters with the annualized $1 per share dividend expected to be ultimately funded with free cash flow. Additionally, our Board has authorized $1 billion share repurchase program.', ""As the liquidity and debt parameters I defined earlier are satisfied, we intend to repurchase shares in line with our free cash flow and asset sale proceeds. To reiterate, our free cash flow and proceeds from divestments will be prioritized as follows. The first dollar will be allocated to maintaining our minimum cash balance, the second will be applying to reducing debt to $8 billion, and the third will go towards share repurchases. Our goal portfolio positioned us to improve margins and performance over time, funding our capital allocation priorities and allowing us to reward our shareholders directly with returns of capital. And we believe reducing debt and returning capital to shareholders creates attractive value proposition for [indiscernible] existing investors while also improving the company's financial position over the long term."", ""I'll now turn it back to Tom for closing remarks."", 'Thomas Palmer: Thanks, Karyn. Newmont go forward Tier 1 portfolio sets the new standard for gold and copper mining and provides our shareholders with exposure to the highest concentration of Tier 1 assets in the sector, located in the most favorable mining jurisdictions, and with improving cost profile to maximize margins and generate strong free cash flow. The industry-leading growth optionality in copper and gold through disciplined reinvestment and project execution and a balanced shareholder return framework. As we look forward to this very important year of integration and transformation, I am very confident in the quality of our assets and the capability of our team to deliver on our commitments and justify our position as the benchmark gold equity.', ""This year, we'll also be continuing to work on transforming our go-forward portfolio and importantly, building out the strategic and life-of-mine plans for each of our managed sections.

', ""In June 2022, year-over-year consumer price index (CPI) inflation reached a 40-year high of 9.1%. However, throughout most of 2023, stabilized prices were observed due to elevated interest rates and declining energy prices. Despite a slowing rate of increase, the latest CPI reading remains somewhat discouraging for investors who anticipated a continuous decline in inflation with the latest Federal Reserve monetary policy measures. The most recent report from the Labor Department indicates that in January, the CPI rose 3.1% year-over-year, a decrease from December's 3.4% gain but higher than the expected 2.9% increase. On a monthly basis, the CPI increased by 0.3%, surpassing economists' estimates of a 0.2% gain."", 'The current US inflation and the possibility of a more lenient Federal Reserve policy are sparking discussions about a mild economic slowdown instead of a recession, a severe economic downturn, or a bear market, according to JPMorgan. Leading indicators suggest a deceleration in growth rather than a sudden collapse. Some indicators, such as real estate, corporate, and household delinquency rates, are on the rise, but history shows that these usually trail behind other signals for investors. Essentially, equity markets typically hit their lowest points well before the peak of economic turmoil, with the dot-com cycle being a notable exception. While there is still risk of a recession in 2025, it is important to note that even if it occurs, it is likely to be mild, especially with the Federal Reserve offering significant indirect liquidity to the banking system. JPMorgan acknowledged that investors face challenges, including the impact on public sector finances due to large deficits, markets that have already factored in a very gradual economic slowdown, and the significant influence of mega-cap stocks. In 2023, S&P 500 earnings remained stagnant. However, they surged by 33% for the top 7 mega-cap stocks and declined by 5% for the rest of the S&P 500. Taking everything into account, 2024 seems poised for a year of decelerating GDP growth, single-digit earnings growth, and single-digit returns for the average S&P 500 stock, per the bank’s report. ', 'On February 18, Goldman Sachs increased its year-end target for the S&P 500 index to 5,200, indicating a potential 4% increase from its current levels. This adjustment is attributed to a more positive earnings outlook for the companies within the index. Previously, Goldman Sachs had anticipated the index reaching 5,100 by the end of 2024. This initial projection was then revised from 4,700 in December, driven by factors such as moderating inflation and the anticipation of the US central bank implementing interest rate reductions throughout the year. David Kostin, lead strategist at Goldman Sachs, told Reuters: ', '""We expect strong world GDP growth and a slightly weaker dollar will support EPS, while lower rates and lower oil prices will be a slight drag."" ', ""In 2024, Morningstar believes that the focus will shift towards a more fundamental analysis of individual companies and sectors, moving away from the macroeconomic and behavioral factors that influenced the market in recent years. Economic growth was expected to decelerate not only in the fourth quarter of 2023 but the trend will persist throughout the next three quarters, until a resurgence in the third quarter. Expectations include the Federal Reserve initiating rate cuts in 2024 and throughout 2025, concluding by 2026. This reduction in the federal funds rate is predicted to bring the 10-year Treasury yield down to a long-term projection of 2.75%, a decline from the current 4%. In terms of GDP growth, short-term forecasts align closely with consensus, but over a five-year horizon, Morningstar expects a cumulative 3% higher real GDP growth compared to consensus. This is primarily attributed to perspectives on the supply side, involving labor force expansion and productivity growth. Inflation has significantly receded, and by the second quarter of 2024, a return to the Federal Reserve's 2% target is forecasted."", 'Amid this market backdrop, some investors prefer to buy stocks that are trading near 52-week lows to reap the benefits later.

GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with WYNN.', ""On February 23, 2024, Wynn Resorts Ltd (NASDAQ:WYNN) filed its annual 10-K report, providing a comprehensive overview of its financial health and strategic direction. As a premier operator of luxury casinos and resorts, WYNN has shown a commendable recovery in its Macau operations, with gaming revenues bouncing back to $22.7 billion in 2023, a significant rise from the pandemic-stricken figures. The Las Vegas operations also reported increased gaming revenues and visitation, indicating a robust rebound in the tourism and gaming sectors. Wynn Resorts continues to innovate, with plans to open a new building next to Wynn Palace around 2028 and a phased development adjacent to Encore Boston Harbor expected to open in 2026. Despite these positive developments, WYNN faces stiff competition and must navigate geopolitical tensions that could affect consumer spending and travel. The company's commitment to sustainability, as evidenced by its investments in renewable energy and corporate social responsibility initiatives, enhances its reputation and aligns with modern stakeholder expectations."", ""Brand Prestige and Luxury Experience: Wynn Resorts Ltd (NASDAQ:WYNN) has established itself as a symbol of luxury and exclusivity in the hospitality and gaming industry. The company's resorts are synonymous with high-end amenities and superior customer service, which have been instrumental in attracting a premium clientele. This brand prestige is underpinned by numerous awards and recognitions, including high rankings in the luxury hotel category. Wynn's focus on artistry and championship craftsmanship has set its properties apart, creating a unique and memorable experience for guests. The company's strategic emphasis on service-driven culture and excellence has not only fostered customer loyalty but also enhanced its competitive positioning in the market."", ""Strategic Geographic Presence: Wynn Resorts' strategic locations in key tourist destinations like Macau and Las Vegas have been a major strength. The Macau operations, in particular, benefit from being part of one of the world's largest concentrations of potential gaming and tourism customers. With the recent renewal of the gaming concession contract for another 10 years, Wynn Macau SA is well-positioned to capitalize on the region's growth. The Las Vegas operations also enjoy a prime position in the largest gaming market in the United States, with Wynn Las Vegas and Encore contributing significantly to the company's revenue streams. These strategic locations, coupled with Wynn's reputation for luxury, position the company to continue capturing a significant share of the high-end gaming and tourism market."", ""Dependence on Limited Number of Properties: Wynn Resorts Ltd (NASDAQ:WYNN) operates a relatively small number of properties, which could be seen as a weakness. This concentration means that the company's financial performance is heavily reliant on the success and stability of a few key resorts. Any adverse events affecting these locations, such as regulatory changes, economic downturns, or other disruptions, could have a disproportionate impact on Wynn's overall financial health. Additionally, the company's ability to generate cash flow and pay dividends is contingent on the performance of these properties, which adds an element of risk for investors."", ""Geopolitical Sensitivities and Regulatory Risks: Wynn Resorts' operations are sensitive to geopolitical tensions and regulatory changes, particularly in Macau, which is governed as a special administrative region of China. Changes in visa policies, travel restrictions, or diplomatic relations can significantly affect visitation and spending patterns at Wynn's properties. The gaming industry in Macau has previously experienced volatility due to such factors, and Wynn's reliance on this market exposes it to potential fluctuations in revenue. Moreover, the company must navigate complex regulatory environments in all its locations, which requires constant vigilance and adaptability to ensure compliance and maintain its gaming licenses."", ""Expansion and Diversification: Wynn Resorts Ltd (NASDAQ:WYNN) has significant opportunities for expansion and diversification. The company's planned developments, such as the new building next to Wynn Palace and the phased development adjacent to Encore Boston Harbor, are poised to enhance its portfolio and attract new customer segments. These projects are expected to introduce additional gaming facilities, entertainment venues, and other amenities that will drive growth. Furthermore, Wynn's investment in a new integrated resort property in Ras Al Khaimah, United Arab Emirates, signals its intention to diversify geographically and tap into new markets, potentially mitigating risks associated with its current geographic concentration."", ""Recovery and Growth in Post-Pandemic Era: As the world recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic, Wynn Resorts is well-positioned to benefit from the resurgence in global travel and tourism. The lifting of travel restrictions and the return of consumer confidence are likely to result in increased visitation and spending across Wynn's properties. The company's strong brand and reputation for luxury could attract high-net-worth individuals looking for premium experiences, providing a significant opportunity for revenue growth. Additionally, Wynn's commitment to health and safety measures will be crucial in reassuring guests and maintaining its position as a destination of choice in the post-pandemic landscape."", 'Intense Competition and Market Saturation: Wynn Resorts Ltd (NASDAQ:WYNN) operates in an industry characterized by intense competition.

However, throughout most of 2023, stabilized prices were observed due to elevated interest rates and declining energy prices. Despite a slowing rate of increase, the latest CPI reading remains somewhat discouraging for investors who anticipated a continuous decline in inflation with the latest Federal Reserve monetary policy measures. The most recent report from the Labor Department indicates that in January, the CPI rose 3.1% year-over-year, a decrease from December's 3.4% gain but higher than the expected 2.9% increase. On a monthly basis, the CPI increased by 0.3%, surpassing economists' estimates of a 0.2% gain."", 'The current US inflation and the possibility of a more lenient Federal Reserve policy are sparking discussions about a mild economic slowdown instead of a recession, a severe economic downturn, or a bear market, according to JPMorgan. Leading indicators suggest a deceleration in growth rather than a sudden collapse. Some indicators, such as real estate, corporate, and household delinquency rates, are on the rise, but history shows that these usually trail behind other signals for investors. Essentially, equity markets typically hit their lowest points well before the peak of economic turmoil, with the dot-com cycle being a notable exception. While there is still risk of a recession in 2025, it is important to note that even if it occurs, it is likely to be mild, especially with the Federal Reserve offering significant indirect liquidity to the banking system. JPMorgan acknowledged that investors face challenges, including the impact on public sector finances due to large deficits, markets that have already factored in a very gradual economic slowdown, and the significant influence of mega-cap stocks. In 2023, S&P 500 earnings remained stagnant. However, they surged by 33% for the top 7 mega-cap stocks and declined by 5% for the rest of the S&P 500. Taking everything into account, 2024 seems poised for a year of decelerating GDP growth, single-digit earnings growth, and single-digit returns for the average S&P 500 stock, per the bank’s report. ', 'On February 18, Goldman Sachs increased its year-end target for the S&P 500 index to 5,200, indicating a potential 4% increase from its current levels. This adjustment is attributed to a more positive earnings outlook for the companies within the index. Previously, Goldman Sachs had anticipated the index reaching 5,100 by the end of 2024. This initial projection was then revised from 4,700 in December, driven by factors such as moderating inflation and the anticipation of the US central bank implementing interest rate reductions throughout the year. David Kostin, lead strategist at Goldman Sachs, told Reuters: ', '""We expect strong world GDP growth and a slightly weaker dollar will support EPS, while lower rates and lower oil prices will be a slight drag."" ', ""In 2024, Morningstar believes that the focus will shift towards a more fundamental analysis of individual companies and sectors, moving away from the macroeconomic and behavioral factors that influenced the market in recent years. Economic growth was expected to decelerate not only in the fourth quarter of 2023 but the trend will persist throughout the next three quarters, until a resurgence in the third quarter. Expectations include the Federal Reserve initiating rate cuts in 2024 and throughout 2025, concluding by 2026. This reduction in the federal funds rate is predicted to bring the 10-year Treasury yield down to a long-term projection of 2.75%, a decline from the current 4%. In terms of GDP growth, short-term forecasts align closely with consensus, but over a five-year horizon, Morningstar expects a cumulative 3% higher real GDP growth compared to consensus. This is primarily attributed to perspectives on the supply side, involving labor force expansion and productivity growth. Inflation has significantly receded, and by the second quarter of 2024, a return to the Federal Reserve's 2% target is forecasted."", 'Amid this market backdrop, some investors prefer to buy stocks that are trading near 52-week lows to reap the benefits later.

(NASDAQ:WBD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:', '“The rules have improved how we analyze existing holdings and influenced the price at which we will buy a new holding and/or trim or add to an existing one. This has resulted in a higher level of resizing positions in the portfolio and exiting some long-term holdings this year. A good example in the portfolio today is Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD), a company that we bought too early but that remains a holding in the portfolio. Our average price for the initial WBD investment in 2021 was $26.48, or a P/V ratio in the mid-60s%. However, P/EV on the initial report was 79%. Under the new rules, we would not pay that price for the company today.

(NYSE:BAX) For Its Next Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/might-not-great-idea-buy-122732507.html,1708777652,STORY,['BAX'],"[""Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Thus, you can purchase Baxter International's shares before the 29th of February in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 1st of April."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.29 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$1.16 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Baxter International has a trailing yield of 2.7% on the current stock price of US$42.55. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to investigate whether Baxter International can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Baxter International ', ""Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Baxter International lost money last year, so the fact that it's paying a dividend is certainly disconcerting. There might be a good reason for this, but we'd want to look into it further before getting comfortable. With the recent loss, it's important to check if the business generated enough cash to pay its dividend. If cash earnings don't cover the dividend, the company would have to pay dividends out of cash in the bank, or by borrowing money, neither of which is long-term sustainable. It paid out more than half (57%) of its free cash flow in the past year, which is within an average range for most companies."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", 'Companies with falling earnings are riskier for dividend shareholders. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. Baxter International was unprofitable last year and, unfortunately, the general trend suggests its earnings have been in decline over the last five years, making us wonder if the dividend is sustainable at all.', ""Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Baxter International's dividend payments per share have declined at 5.1% per year on average over the past 10 years, which is uninspiring. While it's not great that earnings and dividends per share have fallen in recent years, we're encouraged by the fact that management has trimmed the dividend rather than risk over-committing the company in a risky attempt to maintain yields to shareholders."", ""Get our latest analysis on Baxter International's balance sheet health here."", ""From a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Baxter International? We're a bit uncomfortable with it paying a dividend while being loss-making. However, we note that the dividend was covered by cash flow. It's not that we think Baxter International is a bad company, but these characteristics don't generally lead to outstanding dividend performance."", ""So if you're still interested in Baxter International despite it's poor dividend qualities, you should be well informed on some of the risks facing this stock. For example, Baxter International has 2 warning signs (and 1 which is concerning) we think you should know about."", ""Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

', ""In June 2022, year-over-year consumer price index (CPI) inflation reached a 40-year high of 9.1%. However, throughout most of 2023, stabilized prices were observed due to elevated interest rates and declining energy prices. Despite a slowing rate of increase, the latest CPI reading remains somewhat discouraging for investors who anticipated a continuous decline in inflation with the latest Federal Reserve monetary policy measures. The most recent report from the Labor Department indicates that in January, the CPI rose 3.1% year-over-year, a decrease from December's 3.4% gain but higher than the expected 2.9% increase. On a monthly basis, the CPI increased by 0.3%, surpassing economists' estimates of a 0.2% gain."", 'The current US inflation and the possibility of a more lenient Federal Reserve policy are sparking discussions about a mild economic slowdown instead of a recession, a severe economic downturn, or a bear market, according to JPMorgan. Leading indicators suggest a deceleration in growth rather than a sudden collapse. Some indicators, such as real estate, corporate, and household delinquency rates, are on the rise, but history shows that these usually trail behind other signals for investors. Essentially, equity markets typically hit their lowest points well before the peak of economic turmoil, with the dot-com cycle being a notable exception. While there is still risk of a recession in 2025, it is important to note that even if it occurs, it is likely to be mild, especially with the Federal Reserve offering significant indirect liquidity to the banking system. JPMorgan acknowledged that investors face challenges, including the impact on public sector finances due to large deficits, markets that have already factored in a very gradual economic slowdown, and the significant influence of mega-cap stocks. In 2023, S&P 500 earnings remained stagnant. However, they surged by 33% for the top 7 mega-cap stocks and declined by 5% for the rest of the S&P 500. Taking everything into account, 2024 seems poised for a year of decelerating GDP growth, single-digit earnings growth, and single-digit returns for the average S&P 500 stock, per the bank’s report. ', 'On February 18, Goldman Sachs increased its year-end target for the S&P 500 index to 5,200, indicating a potential 4% increase from its current levels. This adjustment is attributed to a more positive earnings outlook for the companies within the index. Previously, Goldman Sachs had anticipated the index reaching 5,100 by the end of 2024. This initial projection was then revised from 4,700 in December, driven by factors such as moderating inflation and the anticipation of the US central bank implementing interest rate reductions throughout the year. David Kostin, lead strategist at Goldman Sachs, told Reuters: ', '""We expect strong world GDP growth and a slightly weaker dollar will support EPS, while lower rates and lower oil prices will be a slight drag."" ', ""In 2024, Morningstar believes that the focus will shift towards a more fundamental analysis of individual companies and sectors, moving away from the macroeconomic and behavioral factors that influenced the market in recent years. Economic growth was expected to decelerate not only in the fourth quarter of 2023 but the trend will persist throughout the next three quarters, until a resurgence in the third quarter. Expectations include the Federal Reserve initiating rate cuts in 2024 and throughout 2025, concluding by 2026. This reduction in the federal funds rate is predicted to bring the 10-year Treasury yield down to a long-term projection of 2.75%, a decline from the current 4%. In terms of GDP growth, short-term forecasts align closely with consensus, but over a five-year horizon, Morningstar expects a cumulative 3% higher real GDP growth compared to consensus. This is primarily attributed to perspectives on the supply side, involving labor force expansion and productivity growth. Inflation has significantly receded, and by the second quarter of 2024, a return to the Federal Reserve's 2% target is forecasted."", 'Amid this market backdrop, some investors prefer to buy stocks that are trading near 52-week lows to reap the benefits later.

GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with CCI.', ""On February 23, 2024, Crown Castle Inc (NYSE:CCI) filed its annual 10-K report, providing a comprehensive overview of its financial health and strategic positioning. As a leading owner and lessor of approximately 40,000 cell towers and over 85,000 route miles of fiber in the United States, CCI operates a critical infrastructure backbone for wireless service providers. The company's financial tables reflect a strong balance sheet, with site rental revenues from the Towers segment amounting to $4,313 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This financial stability, coupled with a strategic focus on shared communications infrastructure, positions CCI as a pivotal player in the telecommunications industry."", ""Infrastructure Dominance and Strategic Tenant Contracts: Crown Castle Inc's extensive network of towers and fiber assets forms the backbone of its strength. With over 40,000 towers and approximately 90,000 route miles of fiber, CCI offers unparalleled coverage and connectivity solutions. The company's long-term tenant contracts, which are recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable term, ensure a stable and predictable revenue stream. In 2023, the Towers segment alone generated $4,313 million in site rental revenues, underscoring the robust demand for CCI's infrastructure."", ""Customer Relationships and ESG Commitment: Another pillar of CCI's strength is its concentrated customer base, with the big three U.S. mobile carriers accounting for about 75% of its revenue. These strategic relationships, built on a track record of reliability and service excellence, provide a competitive edge. Additionally, CCI's commitment to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals, including a target to achieve carbon neutrality by 2025, enhances its reputation and aligns with broader societal values, potentially attracting sustainability-conscious investors."", ""Customer Concentration Risk: While CCI's concentrated customer base is a strength, it also presents a significant risk. The reliance on a few major customers for the majority of its revenue exposes the company to potential financial instability should any key customer alter their strategy or face financial difficulties. This dependency underscores the need for CCI to diversify its customer portfolio to mitigate this vulnerability."", ""Regulatory and Environmental Compliance: CCI's operations are subject to stringent federal, state, and local regulations, including those from the FCC and FAA. Compliance with these regulations is critical, and any failure could result in fines or operational restrictions. Additionally, as an owner and operator of real property, CCI faces strict liability for environmental cleanup and related claims, which could have material adverse effects on its financial condition."", ""Data Demand and 5G Expansion: The insatiable demand for data and the ongoing expansion of 5G technology present significant growth opportunities for CCI. As wireless service providers invest in network infrastructure to support increased data consumption and 5G deployment, CCI's extensive tower and fiber networks are well-positioned to meet these needs. The company's existing small cell deployments and fiber solutions are poised to capitalize on this trend, potentially driving substantial revenue growth."", 'Strategic Acquisitions and Partnerships: CCI has the opportunity to expand its market presence through strategic acquisitions and partnerships. By acquiring complementary assets or forming alliances with other industry players, CCI can enhance its service offerings, enter new markets, and further solidify its competitive position in the telecommunications infrastructure sector.', ""Competitive Landscape and Technological Substitutes: The telecommunications infrastructure industry is highly competitive, with numerous players offering similar services. CCI faces competition from other tower owners, service providers, and equipment vendors capable of providing turnkey solutions. Additionally, technological advancements could introduce substitutes or alternatives to traditional tower-based infrastructure, potentially diminishing the demand for CCI's assets."", ""Interest Rate Sensitivity and Debt Management: CCI's financial performance is sensitive to interest rate fluctuations, as evidenced by the $1.8 billion of floating rate debt reported as of December 31, 2023. A hypothetical increase in market interest rates could significantly impact the company's interest expenses, affecting its profitability. Effective debt management and hedging strategies are crucial to mitigate this risk and maintain financial stability."", ""In conclusion, Crown Castle Inc (NYSE:CCI) exhibits a strong market position with its extensive infrastructure network and strategic customer relationships. However, the company must navigate the challenges of customer concentration, regulatory compliance, and a competitive landscape. With the telecommunications industry evolving rapidly, CCI's ability to leverage its strengths, address its weaknesses, capitalize on opportunities, and mitigate threats will be critical to its continued success."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bruce."", ""Bruce Bodine: Good morning. Thank you for joining our call today. This is my first earnings call as Mosaic's CEO and I'd like to begin by acknowledging Joc O'Rourke for his many contributions to the company. Joc held this role for nearly a decade and the company is much stronger today thanks to his leadership. Under Joc, Mosaic expanded its footprint in Brazil with the successful Vale Fertilizantes acquisition. We completed development of the world's largest potash mine. We transformed our cost structures and we deleveraged and optimized our balance sheet. We have opportunities to improve returns and drive shareholder value by building on the current position of strength that Joc helped create. I look forward to evolving Mosaic's strategy and to helping all of you understand just how we will do that."", 'So, for today, there are a few key messages that we would like you to take away from this call. First, phosphate markets are very strong. We expect dynamics to remain constructive for the foreseeable future and we are working to optimize our production so we can benefit fully. Second, we expect demand recovery in potash. In fact we are seeing early signs of demand emerging in Brazil. That said given current potash economics we will be curtailing production from our Colonsay mine. Third, we are taking these actions as well as reducing costs and capital expenditures to improve through cycle returns. Finally, with our strong financial foundation in place, we remain committed to prudent capital allocation, selectively investing when risk-adjusted returns are compelling, and returning excess cash through share repurchases and dividends.', ""For full year 2023, Mosaic generated revenue of $13.7 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $2.8 billion, and adjusted earnings per share of $3.57. We invested $1.4 billion in the business, refinanced $900 million in long-term debt, and returned $1.1 billion to shareholders, including over $750 million in share repurchases. Let's start by looking at the market. 2022 brought extreme volatility to fertilizer markets. High prices driven by supply disruption eventually reduced demand. In 2023, as prices retreated customers returned in many key markets. The long-term global grain and oilseed supply and demand picture remains encouraging with secular demand growth outpacing supply. In addition to population and income growth, demand for agricultural commodities is being driven by renewable fuel adoption, which we expect will continue to ramp over the next several years."", 'Recent policy mandates have been announced in California, the European Union and in Singapore, and additional mandates are expected in the future. This emerging source of demand has the potential to require tens of millions of additional acres of production. Short-term fundamentals also look positive. We believe that ongoing weather challenges in key growing regions, including Brazil, will result in grain production lower than what the market is anticipating. This suggests that already low stock-to-use ratios will remain under pressure and support a healthy grain price environment. On this point, there tends to be a lot of focus on the stock to use ratios for corn and soybeans. As you can see in the presentation materials we posted, these two commodities represent approximately 30% of the global potash and phosphate consumption.', 'This means that 70% of consumption is tied to other crops, many of which are experiencing continued tightening in their ratios. We believe the result is that growers around the world continue to be incentivized, to maximize yield and crop production through strong fertilizer applications. In North America, a long fall application season drove strong demand well into the fourth quarter. Solid winter fill activity tells us bins are near empty and channel inventories are low. We are seeing demand strength continue into the spring planting season and sales volumes are mostly committed through March. In Brazil, barter ratios for both soybeans and corn are favorable. And while weather impacts have delayed fertilizer purchases, our outlook for full year 2024 is very positive, with expectations of fertilizer shipments at or near an all-time record as growers need to replenish soil nutrients.', ""Favorable ag commodity and fertilizer demand drivers are especially promising for phosphate markets. We expect global supply will remain tight due in part to China's fertilizer export restrictions as the government prioritizes domestic food security. Tighter environmental oversight has also had an impact with the reduction of domestic DAP production. China also continues to direct more asset to industrial markets. Lithium iron phosphate production has more than tripled in the last two years, and we expect growth to continue at a rapid pace. The competition for phosphate molecules is intensifying. And it will continue to do so for quite some time. This, together with limited capacity additions in the near future, suggests phosphate market fundamentals will remain constructive."", 'For potash, Supply is adequate to meet demand in the near term and economics have not yet improved, which is why we intend to curtail production at Colonsay. We will continue to monitor market developments and customer demand. And when needed, Colonsay will be prepared to return to service in short order. Overall, Ag and fertilizer market dynamics remain solid. At Mosaic, we continue to focus on meeting customer needs executing on our business strategy, optimizing our operations and delivering value to shareholders. Turning now to fourth quarter results and our first quarter outlook. For the fourth quarter of 2023, Mosaic delivered revenue of $3.1 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $646 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.71. Our potash business generated $322 million of adjusted EBITDA on sales volumes of roughly 2.6 million tonnes.', 'With the port at Portland Oregon back up and running, the team at Canpotex had a strong finish to the year, enabling us to deliver sales volumes well within the range of our initial guidance. We expect sales volumes for the first quarter of 2024 in the range of two million to 2.2 million tonnes and potash prices at the mine in the range of $225 to $250 per tonne. In phosphates, we generated $259 million in adjusted EBITDA on sales volumes of 1.6 million tonnes. Realized stripping margins remained strong for the quarter but were offset by lower cost absorption from lower production levels. For the first quarter, we expect phosphate sales volume in the range of 1.6 million to 1.8 million tonnes and DAP realized prices at the mine in the range of $580 to $605 per tonne.', ""Moving to our business in South America. Despite the weather-driven fertilizer demand headwind in the fourth quarter, we delivered strong operating results with adjusted EBITDA of $111 million, distribution business margins came in well above the historical normal annual range of $30 to $40 per tonne. In the first quarter this year, we expect margins to recede from the fourth quarter as part of the normal seasonality of the business. The first quarter of each year typically has a higher amount of fertilizer volume going to Brazil's corn crop, which demands a higher percentage of nitrogen products, which historically generate lower and less consistent margins. And lower volumes of MicroEssentials, which generates higher margins. As a result, margins are generally lower during the quarter but improved from there resulting in annual margins in line with our historic norm of $30 to $40 per tonne."", ""We executed well against our capital allocation strategy in 2023 and our balance sheet remains optimized. We spent $1.4 billion in CapEx and made significant progress on our investment projects. We refinanced $900 million in debt and returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through an increased dividend and share repurchases. Our returns included not only free cash flow but also proceeds from asset sales such as the sale of Streamsong Resort. Finally, I want to discuss, our top strategic initiatives for 2024. First, we're focused on driving down costs. Over time, we expect to achieve at least $150 million in annual run rate savings off of a 2023 baseline, driven in part by savings from our global digital acceleration program, which will go live later this year."", ""Next, we'll continue to transform our operations to increase resilience and flexibility. Our top priority in phosphate is to improve our production volumes. We are working toward an annual run rate of eight million tonnes over the next few quarters by enhancing the overall reliability and efficiency of our operations. To this end, we have a busy turnaround schedule at our Florida facilities in the first half of this year as we target areas that have caused us the most significant maintenance issues. Next, we'll further expand our presence in Brazil, one of the most dynamic agricultural regions in the world by completing a 1 million tonnes distribution facility at Palmeirante to serve the fast-growing northern region of the country. We'll also further strengthen our product portfolio by growing non-commodity products."", ""We are expanding MicroEssentials capacity at our Riverview plant here in Florida, and we expect those additional tonnes later this spring. We anticipate that more than half of our phosphate sales will be value-added products, which clearly is a differentiator for us. In addition, we are planning for the next-generation MicroEssentials Pro, which is delivering significant yield improvements in field testing. MicroEssentials Pro will also extend our patent protection until 2038. Finally, we'll remain true to our disciplined capital allocation strategy. In 2024, we expect to reduce total capital spending by about $200 million, and we'll continue to return excess cash to shareholders. To summarize, our outlook for agriculture and fertilizer markets remains positive."", ""At Mosaic, we have a strategic road map to optimize returns through the business cycle, to grow and to decommoditize our product offerings, and we have a very strong financial foundation from which to operate. I'm looking forward to updating you on our progress as the year proceeds. Now let's move to Q&A."", 'A - Jason Tremblay : Before we move on to the live Q&A, as we have done in the past quarters, we would like to address some of the most common questions that we received after we published our earnings materials last night. For our first question, Bruce, a number of analysts have asked questions about potash and phosphates. Market dynamics of these two crop nutrients seem to be diverging, with phosphates being strong, while potash is finding its way. Can you tell us how you see these markets developing as the year progresses?', 'Bruce Bodine: I think this is a good way to characterize current market conditions. Phosphate markets are very positive due to strong demand, low inventories and a tight supply situation globally leading to some of the strongest stripping margins in the last decade. We believe stripping margins will remain elevated for the remainder of the year. Looking at the key regions. In North America, channel inventories are low, and we are seeing strong demand for spring planting. For Mosaic specifically, we continue to operate at minimum inventory levels, and our first quarter sales are almost fully committed. In Brazil, inventories are well below the five-year range, and our outlook for the year remains positive as growers need to replenish soil nutrients.', ""India's proposed subsidy rates announced earlier this month, showed an increase for phosphate fertilizers from the prevailing rates in the fourth quarter of last year, but importer margins remain negative. With very strong grower demand and low inventories, which are at the low end of the five-year range, subsidies should move higher. In China, we are seeing an increased focus on food security. The government is limiting exports to ensure adequate domestic supply, while also meeting rising industrial demand. We expect these dynamics to continue to limit exports for the foreseeable future. Industrial demand, particularly China's lithium iron phosphate market has been very strong, with production more than tripled in the last two years to 1.7 million tonnes of finished fertilizer product equivalent in 2023."", 'We expect additional production growth in the future as demand continues to sort. Overall, this leads us to conclude that phosphate markets will remain constructive for the rest of the year. In potash, the supply constraints from Belarus and Russia seen in the past few years will continue to abate in 2024. On the demand side, we see stability in North America. In fact, our winter fill program was fully sold. And similar to phosphates, we are almost fully committed for Q1. In Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia, high-priced inventories were worked down in 2023. Two years of under application in those markets will put further strain on crop yields if nutrients are not replenished. We are seeing significant pent-up demand in that region.', ""In China, while potash inventories are higher than historical periods, the fertilizer stock-to-use ratio is normal due to increasing on-farm demand as a result of favorable pricing. It's been reported that China intends to increase its strategic reserves meaning that inventories will have to remain higher than historical periods to meet this objective. We also expect lower Chinese domestic production as a result of the recent news capping production in its key potash basin due to environmental concerns. The combination of these factors should drive a need for continued high import volumes to meet the demand. The weather in Brazil has slowed demand in the near-term but we are seeing early signs of demand emerging in potash prices moving up slightly."", 'In fact when you look at the entire fertilizer market, we expect shipments to be at or near peak levels in 2024. Putting these factors together, we expect the pace of global potash shipments to improve as 2024 progresses.', 'Jason Trembla: Thanks, Bruce. As a follow-up question, given the market backdrop you just described what actions are you planning to take?', ""Bruce Bodine: Well, given the strength of phosphate markets, Mosaic's focuses on increasing our phosphate production volumes and further improving our margins by increasing our MicroEssentials volumes. Getting our production to an annual run rate of 8 million tonnes, not only increases revenue but also significantly reduces our unit costs. MicroEssentials generates significant yield improvements. And as a result, generate superior margins for farmers, retailers and Mosaic. For Mosaic, not only do we earn a premium margin in our phosphate segment but we also command a premium margin in Brazil, as we capture the retail premium for these products. In Potash, Mosaic is focusing on flexibility and cost management. The curtailment of production at our Colonsay site demonstrates our commitment to flexibly managing our network to ensure our low-cost sites at Belle Plaine and Esterhazy, operate at capacity while Colonsay is only used when market conditions dictate."", 'We have a couple of projects that will increase our product mix flexibility before the end of the year. This will enhance our ability to adjust our end product mix to respond to changes in the market conditions more effectively in order to optimize our cost structure and margins. In addition to cost reductions in our operations, we are focused on driving SG&A reductions and optimizing our investments in CapEx and working capital. These initiatives will ensure our customer demand is met. Our through-cycle financial performance will continue to advance and shareholder value is maximized.', 'Jason Trembla: Okay. Our next question is related to Mosaic Fertilizantes. Brazil remains a problem a region for many ag input companies. What is your outlook for 2024?', 'Bruce Bodine: This is a fair observation. A lot of these companies are still in the process of destocking excess high-cost inventories or writing off their assets, given the challenging market conditions. At Mosaic, we took early action to complete the destocking of high-priced inventory in the first half of 2023, without any significant write-offs. As a result, we entered the second half of the year in a great position and it shows in our margins. The margin per tonne in our distribution business returned to the $30 to $40 range in the third quarter and came in above that range in the fourth quarter. In 2024, we expect record or near record fertilizer shipments despite lower fertilizer demand in quarter one due to weather conditions, as growers continue to be incentivized by constructive BARDA ratios and the need to replenish soil nutrients.', 'From a distribution margin perspective, we expect normal seasonality on a per tonne basis, lower than the normalized annual range in the first quarter, but within the range for the full year.', ""Jason Tremblay: Changing topics. There's a question about CapEx. You're indicating that spending will decline by approximately $200 million this year. How do you see that CapEx evolving longer term?"", ""Bruce Bodine: We're coming out of a period of elevated CapEx due to an unusual number of high-returning opportunity projects from across the business. We are coming to the end of these projects, and as a result, our spending is declining. In addition to the $200 million reduction in 2024, we anticipate a further reduction in 2025 with a longer-term run rate to be at or below $1 billion."", 'Jason Tremblay: Thanks, Bruce. And with that, we will now move to the open question-and-answer session. Operator, please open the line for follow-up questions.', 'See also 14 Legit Reasons to Back Out of a Home Purchase and 16 States With the Lowest Or No Sales Tax.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

If you would like to discuss our detailed discussion and analysis of the shareholder activism space as of 2024, you can skip it and go directly to\xa05 Best Shareholder Activism Law Firms.\xa0', 'A shareholder activist is someone who brings about changes within a publicly traded company or for a PLC by practicing their rights as a shareholder. They typically buy up a stake of voting shares, a minimum of 5%, in a company and employ various tactics to force a change in the company.\xa0', 'A shareholder can have various motives to turn to activism, like wanting to increase the value of the company stocks they own or even to address a governing issue that they might feel is hurting the long-term value. Moreover, shareholders turn to activism when they find issues with the company’s products or business practices.\xa0', ""To bring the desired change, shareholder activists use different tactics like negotiating with management or passing a shareholder resolution, where a proposal is submitted by shareholders at the annual meeting to call for or request a specified action by the corporate board. A shareholder activist may also use media pressure to draw the public's attention to an ongoing issue or a problem with management. Furthermore, if a group of shareholders are not satisfied with the corporation's management, they may team up to win a corporate vote against the management and bring the desired changes.\xa0"", 'When nothing works, shareholders may also initiate legal action against the company’s management to achieve their desired goal. Although the litigation route is open for both parties, it is mostly avoided as the legal processes can be extremely costly and even damage the goodwill of the company.\xa0', 'According to Lazard’s Shareholder Activism Report, 2023 was an exciting year for shareholder activist campaigners, with 252 new campaigns worldwide, representing a 7% year-on-year increase. It was also the year with a record number of shareholder activists (183) — a 21% year-on-year increase from 2022. While both Europe and Asia-Pacific (APAC) companies had record-high campaigns, 69 and 44, North America pulled back slightly with 133 activist campaigns, compared to the previous post-COVID year, 2022.\xa0\xa0', 'In January 2024, Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM), an American multinational oil and gas company, saw two activist investor groups file a proposal to cut down its Scope 3, or end-use, carbon dioxide emissions. In return, Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) filed a lawsuit against the U.S. and Dutch activist shareholder groups for putting a climate resolution that goes against the corporation’s interest. While the activist shareholders have withdrawn the proposal, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) is steadfast in going on with the lawsuit.', 'While Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) was able to tackle investor activism, many companies that are not prepared for activists find themselves under great pressure and challenges.\xa0', 'One example is of Crown Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: CCK), which makes and sells packages for consumer goods, with most sales coming from beverage cans. Carl Icahn, a billionaire, activist investor, and one of WallStreets’ most successful figures, owned 8.5% of the stake in Crown Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: CCK) in 2022. He wanted the company to sell its non-core businesses, invest back in shares, and mainly focus on growing its beverage can segment. Since he was the second-largest shareholder with about $700 million worth of shares, Crown Holdings (NYSE: CCK) appointed two independent directors, Andrew Teno and Jesse Lynn, to win the voting.', 'Another activism campaign of Carl Icahn against Illumina Inc (NASDAQ: ILMN), the sequencing and diagnostics giant, made headlines in October 2023 when he sued the company board for violating fiduciary duties. Earlier in 2022, the EU commission prohibited Illumina Inc (NASDAQ: ILMN), under the EU Merger Regulation, from acquiring an American biotechnology company, Grail, as it would ""reduce competition and choices in the market."" However, Illumina Inc (NASDAQ: ILMN) went ahead with the acquisition in 2023. Carl Icahn, being the biggest opposer of this deal, sued the board of directors for this decision.', 'In 2023, several companies experienced backlash on various issues ranging from abortion rights to climate change, soaring the number of shareholder activist campaigns to a record high. According to the data from Barclays, in the first half of 2023, 59% of all shareholder activists targeted three main sectors — Technology (25%), Industrials (21%), and Healthcare (13%). Meanwhile, 24% of activist campaigns targeted companies with market capitalizations above $10 billion. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG), Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS), HSBC (LON: HSBA), and Unilever (LON: ULVR) were among the top companies targeted by activist shareholder campaigns in 2023.', 'Moreover, in 2023, 46% of all activist shareholder campaigns forced some sort of merger and acquisition (M&A) deal, and some even asked for a sale or a company division. Some investment and asset manager companies like Elliott Investment Management, ValueAct Capital, and Jana Partners urged their target companies to merge, split, or sell themselves. These demands made up 49% of all activist campaigns last year.', 'Despite all the macroeconomic challenges, shareholder activism surged in 2023 and will continue to do so in the future as it is becoming a global trend. According to J.P. Morgan analysis, shareholder activists in the US are focusing their efforts on companies with greater market capitalization. Therefore, companies will have to increase their guard, work on defense strategies, and have a legal team ready for action.\xa0', 'Below, we will discuss the 15 best shareholder activism law firms in 2024.', '15 Best Shareholder Activism Law Firms', 'For our list of the best shareholder activism law firms, we’ve adopted a consensus-based methodology.

The sports apparel specialist is winning market share in a huge industry while pushing into new markets, for one. Sales last quarter were up 19% compared to Nike's flat result. Lululemon achieved some of its best growth in areas outside of its core North American division and in new demographics like men's and kids' wear."", 'The chain is boosting sales via its online platform and with help from the launch of several new locations. Shoppers are increasingly frequenting existing stores, too, with comparable-store sales up 14% in the Q3 period (running through late October).', ""The best reason to like this growth stock might be Lululemon's opportunity to extend its profit margin lead over the competition in the next few years.

Please be advised that we may or may not continue to provide this additional detail in the future.With that, let me turn the call over to Jim for his prepared remarks. Jim?"", 'James R. Scapa', ""Thank you, Dave, and welcome to everyone on the call. The fourth quarter of 2023 carried positive momentum for Altair with record high total quarterly and full year revenue of $171.5 million and $612.7 million, respectively. Software product revenue and total revenue were both well within our guidance with adjusted EBITDA above the top end of the guided range. Altair's Q4 results continue our growth path of helping organizations succeed through computational intelligence.Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 2023 increased by 38.3% year-over-year to $53.6 million, or 31.2% of total revenue. Adjusted EBITDA grew 19% for the full year 2023 to $129.1 million, or 21.1% of total revenue, versus $108.6 million, or 19% of revenue in 2022, continuing our trend of increasing adjusted EBITDA margin by 200 to 300 basis points per year over the last 4 years.Software product revenue for the full year 2023 grew by 8.6% compared to 2022 and 9.8% on a constant currency basis. Software product revenue as a percentage of total revenue for the full year 2023 increased to 90% as compared to 89% in 2022. And the recurring software license rate for 2023 was 93%, an increase from 92% during 2022. Altair's growth continues to be broad based across many geographies, technologies and verticals.In the fall of 2023, we released what we believe was the most important update to our products in the last 10 years. Our upcoming release this spring is expected to take another leap forward as we continue to bring all of our solutions for simulation under a common user framework, graphics engine and back-end data model. In addition, we believe and many customers agree our investments in engineering AI are positioning us as the leader in this important and growing domain because of the enormous base of data science talent and technology we are leveraging across our enterprise.Despite some recent uncertainties around EV sales, the transition of the automotive sector toward alternative power sources, including purely electric, continues to present an exciting field of opportunities for Altair. In December, we announced funding awarded for the U.K. government's Faraday Battery Challenge to a consortium of 3 organizations: Altair, JLR and battery manufacturer, Danecca. The project will leverage Altair's technology to develop vehicles with a new lighter body that offers more room for the battery without adding additional weight. JLR will apply Altair's C123 process, a unique 3-stage concept development process for body-in-white structures and will utilize Altair's technologies for structural optimization and electrothermal simulation.Also in the electric powertrain space, a heavy duty commercial vehicle manufacturer has substantially increased its commitment to Altair's simulation tools for improving battery predictive analytics. In APAC, a leading manufacturer of electric vehicles has made an 8-figure commitment to use a broad portfolio of Altair simulation and data analytics software in its multi-division product development processes. A U.S. headquartered electric vehicle manufacturer doubled its Altair technology purchases, bringing our annual revenue with them into 7 figures. And finally, another U.S. headquartered EV manufacturer signed a 3-year 7-figure agreement with Altair, representing more than 100% growth over the previous 3 years.We had some good fourth quarter wins in the BFSI vertical and for our data analytics solutions. One of the largest credit unions in the U.S. aimed to renewal with 33% growth, recognizing its increased usage and high value from our data analytics and AI platform, RapidMiner. A major European banking group signed on to a major deployment of Altair SLC across many applications throughout its organization. And a North American consulting organization has agreed to use Altair SLC as a primary tool for its work with many clients and supply chain analytics.Altair's high performance computing solutions drove substantial activity in the technology vertical. One of the leading companies in the power semiconductor field placed an order for Altair's workload and workflow management software based on experiencing a 20% throughput increase. This not only enhances its operational efficiency, but also leads to substantial cost savings, given the high cost of EDA application software.An EMEA semiconductor company renewed with a 127% annual increase. We also received a 3-year agreement with 7 figures of annual revenue from a U.S. semiconductor manufacturer based on its desire to leverage cloud computing for design and development while effectively managing cloud usage costs.Indirect sales continues to represent an important percentage of our overall revenue, and we look forward to further success in that regard, especially for our data analytics solutions. We welcomed 3 new channel partners to the Altair sales team in the fourth quarter. Do IT Now is focused on high performance computing applications in EMEA. Neyond in Portugal and Matogen Applied Insights of South Africa are both focused on data analytics and artificial intelligence.Altair has expanded its relationship with the FIRST technology organization founded by Dean Kamen, where Altair technology is now available to all teams in the FIRST Robotics Competition Kit of Parts. More than 3,500 high school teams across 26 countries competing in this year's first robotics competition will have free access to Altair software. Altair's collaboration with FIRST will bolster students' technical skills and support a diverse community of students by building citizenship, self-esteem and leadership through hands-on experiences and project-based learning. Furthering our collaboration with FIRST is a perfect example of Altair's commitment to students and the role they have in technology, both today and in the future.Combining our academic focus with work on e-mobility, Altair India recently formalized a strategic partnership with the Indian Institute of Technology Madras to establish an e-mobility simulation lab within the department of engineering design. This collaborative initiative under Altair's Corporate Social Responsibility program includes grant money from Altair along with simulation and design software and high performance computing infrastructure. Exclusively powered by Altair technologies, the lab's goal is to support startups, researchers and students in advancing the study and development of electric vehicles. We are pleased to be supporting IIT Madras, a clear global leader in educating the world's best and brightest young minds.2023 for Altair was a year of hard work, significant investments in new software technologies, sales team alignment into market verticals, steady focus, and ultimately, outstanding execution from our stellar global teams amidst a lot of economic and geopolitical uncertainty. I am proud of the individual and group accomplishments of our people and appreciative of the strong Altairian culture that keeps us moving forward in ways that benefit our customers, employees, partners and shareholders. We believe the culmination of our organizational advancements, combined with the power of our technology portfolio, positions Altair well for the future.We are holding an Altair Investor Day the morning of March 20 in Santa Clara, California, where we will discuss our vision for the future and our plans to capitalize on our growing market opportunity. We will also introduce what we believe to be a very exciting and disruptive technology for the electronics market. I hope all of our investors and prospective investors as well as the analysts who cover Altair and the markets we compete in will attend.Now I will turn the call over to Matt to provide more details on our financial performance and our guidance for the first quarter and full year of 2024. Matt?"", 'Matthew Charles Brown', ""Thank you, Jim. Hello to everyone on the call, and thank you for joining us. We are pleased with our strong fourth quarter results, which continued to demonstrate the importance of our products to our customers in leveraging computational intelligence to solve the important challenges they face. Despite the somewhat difficult macroeconomic environment that we discussed throughout 2023, we finished the year with record high revenue and adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.1%, well exceeding the 20% goal we had long established for 2023.As I dive into the details of our financial results, remember some of our revenues and expenses are transacted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and therefore, our reported results may be significantly impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates. To aid in the review of our results, throughout my remarks, I will reference growth rates in both reported and constant currency.Starting with Q4 numbers. Calculated total billings for the quarter were $196.1 million, a year-over-year increase of 4.4% in reported currency and 3.6% in constant currency. As a reminder, we exited a lower margin hardware business in 2023 that had historically been weighted most heavily in the fourth quarter, therefore impacting the Q4 year-over-year growth rates. The increase in billings was led by software across all geographies, and we saw billings growth across our verticals with particular strength in automotive, aerospace and technology.Software revenue in Q4 was $155.9 million, a year-over-year increase of 7.6% in reported currency and 6.7% in constant currency compared to Q4 2022. Software revenue growth was led by new customer growth and expansion in existing accounts and supported by a robust renewal base that continues to have a very high rate of retention.Total revenue in Q4, which includes services and other revenue, was $171.5 million, a year-over-year increase of 6.9% in reported currency and 6.0% in constant currency compared to Q4 2022.Non-GAAP gross margin, which excludes stock-based compensation and restructuring expense, was 84.3% in the fourth quarter compared to 80.2% in the prior year quarter, an increase of 410 basis points. The year-over-year increase in non-GAAP gross margin in Q4 was partially due to our exit from the lower margin hardware business that was present in the year ago period. Software mix also contributed slightly to the increase in blended non-GAAP gross margin as our software revenue, which carries a higher gross margin, increased as a percentage of total revenue. Software revenue was 90.9% of total revenue in Q4 compared to 90.4% in the prior year. Over the long term, we continue to expect a general mix shift towards software revenue as growth there will outpace services and other revenue.Non-GAAP operating expenses, which excludes stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets, were $94.0 million compared to $92.6 million in the year ago period.Adjusted EBITDA in Q4 was $53.6 million, or 31.2% of total revenue, compared to $38.7 million, or 24.1% in the prior year, an increase of 38.3%. This increase compared to the prior year quarter as well as relative to our expectations was driven by the increase in gross profit in the quarter, combined with a disciplined approach to spending.Now looking at the full year results for 2023. Calculated billings for the year were $631.8 million, a year-over-year increase of 4.0% in reported currency or 4.8% in constant currency. Remember that in Q1 of last year, we highlighted our largest ever data analytics and AI deal in the BFSI vertical, which was a 5-year 8-figure deal. So this significant multiyear deal in 2022 is impacting the 2023 year-over-year billings growth rates.Software revenue for the year was $550.0 million, a year-over-year increase of 8.6% in reported currency and 9.8% in constant currency. And total revenue for the year was $612.7 million, a year-over-year increase of 7.1% in reported currency and 8.2% in constant currency. Our recurring software license rate, which is the percentage of software billings that are recurring, continues to be strong at approximately 93% for the year. The strength in software revenue helped drive our non-GAAP gross margins for the year to 81.8% compared to 80.0% in 2022, a 180 basis point increase.In addition, non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue declined year-over-year due to reductions in general and administrative costs. This helped drive adjusted EBITDA for the year to $129.1 million, or 21.1% of total revenue, compared to $108.6 million or 19.0% in 2022, a year-over-year increase of $20.5 million or 18.9%. We set out a vision 3 years ago of achieving 20% adjusted EBITDA margin exiting 2023, and I'm proud of our entire team for rallying around that goal and executing to exceed this important milestone. In 2023, we saw more than half of our year-over-year increase in total revenue make its way down to adjusted EBITDA.Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the year with $467.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, an increase of approximately $151.3 million from the prior year. Free cash flow was $117.1 million for the year, exceeding our expectations and driven by the increase in profitability. This represents a substantial increase year-over-year and demonstrates our ability to generate significant free cash flow.Let's turn to guidance for Q1 and full year 2024. We've provided detailed guidance tables in our earnings press release, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP amounts. To provide clarity on the FX impact to our expectations, we've provided growth rates in both reported currency and constant currency in our guidance tables.Over the past couple of years, we've seen a gradual shift in our revenue seasonality away from Q1 and into the remaining 3 quarters as we've continued to broaden our customer base. We are expecting that trend to continue in 2024 and have therefore guided Q1 revenue in a prudent manner.For Q1, we expect software revenue in the range of $152 million to $155 million, a year-over-year increase of 1.6% to 3.6% in reported currency and an increase of 0.8% to 2.8% in constant currency. For full year 2024, we expect software revenue in the range of $600 million to $610 million, a year-over-year increase of 9.1% to 10.9% in reported currency and 8.3% to 10.1% in constant currency.We expect services and other revenue to be flat year-over-year in 2024 compared to the declines we saw over the past couple of years. As a result, we expect total revenue for Q1 in the range of $167 million to $170 million, a year-over-year increase of 0.6% to 2.4% in reported currency and negative 0.1% to positive 1.7% in constant currency.For the full year 2024, we expect total revenue in the range of $663 million to $673 million, a year-over-year increase of 8.2% to 9.8% in reported currency and 7.5% to 9.1% in constant currency. For Q1, we expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $37 million to $40 million, or 22.2% to 23.5% of total revenue compared to $43.1 million or 25.9% of total revenue in Q1 2023.For full year 2024, we expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $143 million to $151 million or 21.6% to 22.4% of total revenue compared to $129.1 million or 21.1% of total revenue in 2023.And finally, for the full year 2024, we expect free cash flow in the range of $129 million to $137 million. As a reminder, our cash flow expectations are sensitive to billings and collection patterns which fluctuate seasonally.We are pleased with overachieving our profitability goals for 2023, and we're excited about the tremendous opportunity that lies ahead as we continue to execute on our future financial targets. With that, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?"", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of Ken Wong with Oppenheimer.', 'Hoi-Fung Wong', ""Jim, I wanted to get your thoughts on kind of how the Synopsys-ANSYS merger kind of might impact Altair's strategic initiatives. I couldn't help but kind of notice you talking about introducing an exciting technology for the electronics market, and just wanted to kind of pick your brain on how you're thinking about the current competitive landscape."", 'James R. Scapa', ""I think I'm on here. Thanks, Ken. Appreciate it. I mean, the combination of Synopsys and ANSYS I think is a fairly natural combination. I've been talking about the convergence not only of HPC and simulation and AI for 5 or 6 years, and actually of mechanical and electronics as well. And Altair has been investing in that direction ourselves, both quietly and noisily for probably the last, I don't know, 10 or 12 years now and much more aggressively in the last couple here. So I mean, I think it's a good combination. Honestly, for us, because there's a great deal of uncertainty that comes during this period where employees and customers don't really know where things are going, I think it presents some opportunities for us, but that remains to be seen."", 'Hoi-Fung Wong', 'Got it. Okay. That makes a lot of sense. And then, Matt, I just wanted to maybe dive in a little bit on the cadence of revenue through the year. 1Q looks a little below typical seasonality. Any thoughts to share there in terms of maybe kind of how either kind of conservatism or any kind of seasonal trends might be playing into how you guys are thinking about it?', 'Matthew Charles Brown', ""Yes, sure. Thanks, Ken. Yes, I noted in my prepared remarks as well to give a little bit of color on this. What we've seen over the last couple of years is somewhat less revenue in Q1 coming in as a percentage of the total. And so what we're seeing in 2024 is that that trend is continuing a little bit. And it makes sense given how we're broadening our customer base. So we've had a concentration historically very heavily in auto, and over time, and in particular over the last few years, we've broadened that so we're somewhat less concentrated there. And as a result, that's causing Q1 revenue, which had historically been our highest revenue quarter, to be more balanced throughout the year. So that's reflected in the guide."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from the line of Dylan Becker with William Blair.', 'Dylan Tyler Becker', 'Jim, maybe for you. You kind of touched on this in your prepared remarks, but 2023 was a pretty active year, a pretty busy year for you guys. We had the platform upgrade. We had the sales force verticalization. We saw some healthy momentum in partnerships, and the industry has remained pretty resilient overall. I guess, how do you think about the importance of all of those pieces or components setting up the business kind of for sustained momentum as we think about the 2024 outlook and obviously potentially beyond that as well? And maybe the trajectory of some of that layering in and maybe how that kind of plays to the revenue linearity as well.', 'James R. Scapa', ""Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. Last year, we made that change to how we go to market. We released a lot of great products. But for us, it was actually also a very prudent year from an investment standpoint, keeping sort of control over things with an eye towards our bottom line to some extent. We come into this year having sort of settled down a lot of those changes where we really I think have a really great sense about these vertical teams. People know how to operate between the regions and the vertical teams really nicely now. We've added a couple of new ones coming into this year as well. And I think we're very, very optimistic that they're going to produce extremely well. Similarly, we've done some really good work on the indirect side. So the go-to-market I feel very, very positive about, and I feel great about the products. So we're very optimistic about 2024, but we remain prudent in how we sort of look at things."", 'Dylan Tyler Becker', ""Got it. Okay. That makes a ton of sense. And then maybe to sticking kind of with the idea as we think about kind of this proliferation across teams and use cases. I guess as you think about kind of that expansion conversation with customers, where are you seeing kind of the greatest drivers of incremental adoption today? Is it, again, an expansion within teams? Is it kind of the computational intensity? Is it, again, platform adoption product usage through the token model? I guess kind of trying to help us think about what are the kind of core drivers of expansion because I think there's a lot of opportunity there as well."", 'James R. Scapa', ""I think it's actually kind of across the board. We have this huge installed base with very, very high recurring revenues. So a huge amount of our growth really comes from expansion within that base, probably 60%, 65% each year. So getting more products into those accounts, bringing some really great new products. The engineering AI I think is finally starting to get traction. Digital Twin is getting huge traction as well. And so we're seeing a lot of opportunity within the installed base. And the vertical teams in general are focusing on a subset, basically the strategic accounts within those verticals for the most part, which means a lot of expansion within those accounts, and that's extremely important for us. That focus is really key."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from the line of Joshua Tilton with Wolfe Research.', 'Joshua Alexander Tilton', 'Thanks for sneaking me in. Can you hear me?', 'James R. Scapa', 'Yes.', 'Joshua Alexander Tilton', ""Two quick ones for me. I think just some of the -- this is kind of the #1 question I've been getting asked since results dropped. But I think people are just trying to understand like what is the level of conservatism that's kind of baked into the outlook for next year that you put out today? And maybe also just within that, like you talked to a more difficult macro environment this year. What does that guidance embed or assume for how the macro plays out over the next 12 months? And I just got a quick follow-up."", 'James R. Scapa', ""Do you want to take a shot there, Matt, or me? Why don't you start?"", 'Matthew Charles Brown', ""Yes, I'll start, and you can finish. Yes. Josh. Appreciate your question. I think we looked at the year and took a pretty pragmatic and prudent approach to guidance. You can see in the first quarter, we're seeing some of that revenue more balanced throughout the year, but we expect it to pick up in the back half of the year and end up in a pretty good spot. So we're feeling very optimistic actually and have lots of reasons to be feeling very, very positive from a go-to-market perspective, from a product perspective. But we're taking a pretty prudent approach to our guide for 2024. Jim, do you have anything to add there?"", 'James R. Scapa', ""Yes, maybe I'll just add. Last year, we were investing a bit less last year. We're coming into this year, and we're starting to ramp up a little bit more investment into this year. And we expect that's going to start to pay some dividends here, both on the product side and on the go-to-market side, actually. So you're going to start to see that coming along through the year, we think. But we are trying to be cautious, we'll say, with how we put guidance out."", 'Joshua Alexander Tilton', ""Super helpful. And then I think the follow-up for me is, is there any way we can get a sense of either for this year or what's baked into next year? Like how do we think about the different growth rates of the business in terms of what the data analytics business is growing versus what the rest of the more I guess what people would think of as core simulation growth either for this past year or going forward?"", 'James R. Scapa', 'Matt, you want to answer that or me?', 'Matthew Charles Brown', ""Sure. Yes, Josh, it's a great question. And not every year is the same. So this year in 2023, we saw just really strong growth in simulation. Simulation led the way. And you may remember in 2022, data analytics and AI led the way for us there in terms of that segment. And so every year is going to be a little bit different. We expect, though, that a lot of these technologies are converging. And so you're starting to see a real blend of data analytics and AI within simulation. It's becoming more and more difficult to distinguish between them, actually. And in terms of growth drivers, that actually helps them all. So critical to the success is that our customers are leveraging our broad portfolio of technology that's helping drive growth. So I think you're going to see contributions to our growth rate from all 3 and even more so as they continue to converge."", 'James R. Scapa', ""Yes, I'd agree. If I could just add to that, I think the engineering AI and the Digital Twin stuff is really ramping up fast. And probably -- it's hard to measure what's simulation and what is, if you will, AI in these accounts, especially with our units model."", 'Joshua Alexander Tilton', 'Super helpful.', 'James R. Scapa', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets.', 'Matthew George Hedberg', 'I wanted to follow up on the earlier question on Synopsys and ANSYS. I guess, Jim, does anything change strategically with Altair in terms of maybe some additional partnerships or incremental focus on cadence? Just sort of wondering if any changes on that front.', 'James R. Scapa', ""Matt. I mean, I think we're sort of continuing on a path that we were on already where we see this convergence of electronics and mechanical. In terms of partnerships specifically, I'm not sure. To be honest with you, I'm not sure what happens in that direction. I guess there are possibilities there with a lot of different players in the electronics market and others. For us, we're continuing to invest. And we -- unlike others, we might feel, we do believe that there are a lot of opening opportunities in the electronics market that we can play in quite interestingly."", 'Matthew George Hedberg', ""Got it. That's helpful, Jim. And then maybe you just sort of touched on this in the prior question. But obviously, you've been invested in high performance compute seemingly for decades, it feels like. And obviously, we're all kind of watching NVIDIA do its thing. Like you said, it may be hard to know where that line is between customer spend on simulation and AI given your model. But do you think -- is there any way that you think going forward that you might start to see some tailwinds and maybe some accelerations that maybe you haven't seen previously given sort of years and years of investment on your part?"", 'James R. Scapa', ""I hope you're right. I'm not sure. That is the honest answer. But we are -- as I said earlier, we are seeing more and more activity around what we call engineering AI. And I think that is going to continue to ramp up and become an important tailwind for us. So the answer is yes. I think that is -- and I think we've been absolutely in front of that wave actually by several years, actually, and I think it's showing. When we go in and benchmark, we're typically winning. And so we're very happy about that."", 'Matthew George Hedberg', 'Got it. Best of luck, guys.', 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from the line of Charles Shi with Needham & Company.', 'Yu Shi', ""My apologies, I do want to ask one more about Synopsys plus ANSYS. I think one of your peer companies -- well, that's the sole -- they kind of have this school of thought which I found very interesting, but I want to get your thoughts as well. They kind of said they think that combination could mean that ANSYS, which means it will become the legacy ANSYS under the Synopsys roof, to become less focused on the simulation and analysis market, but more the combined company will be more focused on semis, which they think it opens up opportunities for them. But do you agree with that school of thought? And hypothetically speaking, if that indeed is the case -- I don't know if that's the case or not because that's not the talking points from those two companies. But if that turned out to be the case, what are the opportunities for Altair? That's my first question."", 'James R. Scapa', ""Okay. I don't know if that's the case either. I think it's quite natural when there's a combination that the leadership and the experiences of the leadership of the combined company is going to tend to drive the direction of the thinking and the strategies. So in this case, I think it could defocus ANSYS a bit and the legacy ANSYS markets, but that remains to be seen. And then certainly, if that happens, certainly we continue to have opportunities. But we think there's opportunity in both the legacy ANSYS markets and in some of the new markets as well. As we see electronics really shifting quite a bit -- and this is the reason I think for the combination into more of a 3D type world and less of these huge, large 2D types of ICs, remains to be seen."", 'Yu Shi', ""Got it. So maybe a second question maybe for Matt. You talked about the broadening customer base changing your seasonality pattern. We definitely see that from your Q1 guide. Can you be a little bit more specific, because it sounds like you were saying automotive vertical, the revenue from that vertical has been a little bit Q1 heavy. But what are the other verticals that may be like Q2, Q3 or Q4 heavy? That's -- we just want to better understand how this broadening customer base is changing your revenue profile, which is kind of like a bathtub shift, right? High in Q1 and Q4, a little bit light in the middle. And kind of it's a little bit difficult for us to forecast and want to get your thoughts and for us to better understand this."", 'Matthew Charles Brown', ""Sure. Thanks, Charles. So namely, and I think most significantly, it's BFSI. So as that vertical has grown, the buying patterns are different than what we've seen in some of our older, more legacy verticals. BFSI, for all intents and purposes, didn't exist for us more than 5 years ago, and in particular over the last couple of years has been growing steadily. And so as a result, as the entire revenue base grows, you start to see some changes in seasonality as that vertical grows. But it's also true for verticals such as technology, for example. So we've just seen a gradual shift somewhat away from auto and into these other verticals that tend to have buying patterns that are either a little bit more balanced throughout the year or even much more back-end loaded towards Q4."", 'Yu Shi', 'Thanks, Matt.', 'Matthew Charles Brown', 'No problem.', 'James R. Scapa', ""If I could just add one thing to that. Maybe it's not directly addressing the question, but we are seeing a tremendous amount of opportunity in aero and defense and electronics and technology. And I think that's very broad-based and going to happen across the verticals as well, not just BFSI."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from the line of Stephen Tusa with J.P. Morgan.', 'Stephen Tusa', ""Just a question on EBITDA margins. You did 200 bps of improvement in 2023. And you've already noted some preselling revenue growth for 2024, but I think about 100 basis points. What's the difference between the years? Are you investing a little bit more this year? Maybe just some color on the margins that that is expected."", 'Matthew Charles Brown', ""Stephen, thanks. It is 210 bps. Don't short me by those 10. So, yes. I mean, so we're obviously very happy about the margin expansion from 2022 to 2023, and it's something that we've been able to demonstrate over the last few years of having really nice margin growth. 2024 is a year in which we see a lot of opportunity ahead of us in back half of 2024 and beyond. And so for that reason, we're just making sure that we're investing in the right areas. So we want to make sure that we're investing in areas for growth, in particular in our sales capacity and in product development, so that we can really capitalize on what we see as some pretty meaningful opportunities out there. So not every year is going to be like the rest. We are, of course, still committed to growing margins meaningfully, but not every year is going to be like the rest. And this is the year in which we think it makes a lot of sense to lean into the opportunities that we have."", 'Stephen Tusa', ""So I guess I was thinking you guys would be kind of leveraging the fixed cost at this stage a little bit more normally like perhaps what you were showing in 2023. Is that going to be kind of a year-to-year decision from here is what you're saying?"", 'Matthew Charles Brown', ""I think when you look over a long period of time, you're going to see the average growth in adjusted EBITDA margin consistent with what we've communicated in the past. So I would probably urge you not to get too hung up on one short period of time or another. I think over time, this will play out in the way that we've described."", 'Stephen Tusa', ""Okay. Great. And then just one other follow-up, just getting back to this discussion of consolidation. I guess, are you guys saying that you're not -- are you concerned at all? Are you comfortable with competing with these larger companies in these more integrated resources?

Scapa', ""Want me to take that one, Matt? I think we're open to all kinds of possibilities, Stephen. But we do think that we're positioned pretty well to compete, quite frankly. So we're open, but we're also heads down and focused on competing."", 'Stephen Tusa', 'Great answer.', 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from the line of Mark Schappel with Loop Capital Markets.', 'Mark William Schappel', ""Jim, starting with you. From an overall demand perspective, I was wondering if you could just comment on whether you've seen any changes in the demand environment over the past 90 days or so, mainly in terms of, say, buying behavior or sales cycles? And also, maybe you could just talk a little bit about what you're seeing in Europe."", 'James R. Scapa', ""Yes. So in general, I think we're seeing greater strength on the pipeline basically over the last 90 days, and we're obviously very pleased with that. And this is part of why we're investing. And we're investing on the product side as well because we think there's some very, very interesting opportunities there and to bring some differentiation into the market and with some of the changes we see happening in some of these markets. Europe, you're talking about what in Europe, let me ask more specifically."", 'Mark William Schappel', ""Just overall demand and like the industrial base you're seeing over in Europe."", 'James R. Scapa', ""I think it's very strong in general for us."", 'Mark William Schappel', 'Okay. Great. And then along with that, maybe you could just talk a little bit about the strength of the aerospace industry you saw in the quarter. I know earlier in 2023, aerospace was particularly strong. And I was just curious if that strength is continuing into Q4.', 'James R. Scapa', ""Yes. The aerospace market for us is -- that's one where moving to the vertical organization really helps because we have much more focus on the applications and needs of those accounts and sharing information and all of that across our enterprise. So that's absolutely a strong vertical. We've also put renewed emphasis on defense as well. We brought in some new team members on the defense side, and we think they're going to make quite a difference here. And those are part of the investments that we're making."", 'Operator', ""That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Jim Scapa for closing remarks."", 'James R. Scapa', ""Thank you, Liz. So just in conclusion, I just want to make sure I invite everyone. We actually have two events coming up. We mentioned our Investor Relations Day, which is on March 20 in Santa Clara, California. And then the second one is coming up sooner than that, which is on March 6 and 7. It's our annual Future.Industry event. It's a virtual event. And typically we have 10,000 to 15,000 attendees coming to that, hopefully even more this year. And so I think that's a nice opportunity to see what's new in our products and our platforms and also to hear from a number of our customers and how they're using the products. So I just want to thank everyone on my team for having another great year in 2023 and really looking forward to 2024. Thank you."", 'Operator', ""This concludes today's conference call.

If you're one of the lucky ones who doesn't need to use that money to pay off credit card debt, one smart way to use that money is to build up your stock portfolio."", ""That said, it's also important to bear in mind that you shouldn't buy stocks without understanding that this type of investing requires a minimum of a five-year horizon. If you know you're going to need that money in less than five years, it's arguably better to consider a safer and more tax-friendly vehicle like a certificate of deposit or a money market account."", ""Which stocks could make the most of your tax refund without taking on an undue amount of risk? One stock that fits the bill is Warren Buffett's diversified holding company Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B). Read on to find out more about this incredible blue-chip stock and why it deserves a spot in your portfolio."", ""Berkshire Hathaway, led by super investor Warren Buffett, is a diversified holding company with a proven track record of wealth creation. Its value-focused investing strategy centers around buying high-quality companies at a discount, which has paid off handsomely for the company's long-term shareholders."", ""Since Buffett took over as CEO in 1965, Berkshire's stock has outperformed the benchmark S&P 500 index (including dividends) by a factor of 153 times.

However, there are good reasons to consider buying Berkshire stock right now. Three of the most compelling reasons are:"", '1. Market Valuation: The broader market has become exceptionally pricey, as evidenced by its elevated cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio (CAPE). Specifically, the S&P 500 is trading at almost twice its historical average CAPE ratio, implying that a sizable downside correction may be in the cards later this year or early next year. After all, trends like artificial intelligence and weight loss drugs will eventually lose steam, and fundamentals will matter once again.', ""2. Cash Reserves: Berkshire's massive cash pile is roughly equivalent to the market capitalization ($154 billion) of the major drug manufacturer Pfizer right now. It thus has plenty of financial firepower to take advantage of bargains as they become available and any irrational market dynamics."", ""3. Historical Consistency: Berkshire stock is highly unlikely to lose you money over the next five years.

Although the dividend is now higher, the yield is only 1.7%, which is below the industry average.', ' See our latest analysis for Fox ', 'It would be nice for the yield to be higher, but we should also check if higher levels of dividend payment would be sustainable. Before making this announcement, Fox was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.', 'Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 121.1% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 14% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.', ""Even though the company has been paying a consistent dividend for a while, we would like to see a few more years before we feel comfortable relying on it. Since 2019, the annual payment back then was $0.46, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $0.52. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 2.5% over that duration. We like that the dividend hasn't been shrinking. However we're conscious that the company hasn't got an overly long track record of dividend payments yet, which makes us wary of relying on its dividend income."", ""Investors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. However, things aren't all that rosy. Fox has seen earnings per share falling at 6.6% per year over the last five years. If earnings continue declining, the company may have to make the difficult choice of reducing the dividend or even stopping it completely - the opposite of dividend growth. Earnings are forecast to grow over the next 12 months and if that happens we could still be a little bit cautious until it becomes a pattern."", ""In summary, while it's always good to see the dividend being raised, we don't think Fox's payments are rock solid. The payments haven't been particularly stable and we don't see huge growth potential, but with the dividend well covered by cash flows it could prove to be reliable over the short term. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks."", 'Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. To that end, Fox has 5 warning signs (and 1 which is potentially serious) we think you should know about.

One is a lot of investors don\'t believe that consumers are going to buy it because it only contains about half of the sports rights. And the second reason is they fear that a lot of people will buy it, but they\'re going to spin down from their big, fat pay TV package to something that\'s cheaper and thinner, and that\'s going to hurt Fox. That\'s why Fox traded down on the news. Our thesis is pretty simple. A lot of people are going to buy this and it\'s actually going to bring in cord cutters, cord nevers that have never had a pay TV subscription. It\'s actually going to be positive for the stock.""', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino"", '[AUDIO LOGO]', ""JOSH LIPTON: Shares of Fox scoring an upgrade today, thanks to optimism on the entertainment company's planned sports streaming bundle with Warner Brothers Discovery and Disney's ESPN. Joining us now is the analyst behind that call, Jason Bazinet, Citi Managing Director. Jason, always good to have you on the show. So you upgrade Fox to a buy, Jason. Your target goes to 35. How come, Jason? Walk us through the argument."", ""JASON BAZINET: Well, there's a lot of skepticism about the efficacy of this sports bundle on two fronts. One is a lot of investors don't believe that consumers are going to buy it, because it only contains about half of the sports rights. And the second reason is they fear that a lot of people will buy it. But they're going to spend down from their big fat pay TV package to something that's cheaper and thinner. And that's going to hurt Fox. And that's why Fox traded down on the news."", ""Our thesis is pretty simple. A lot of people are going to buy this. And it's actually going to bring in cord cutters, cord nevers that have never had a pay TV subscription. And it's actually going to be positive for stock-- for the stock."", 'JULIE HYMAN: And is it going to benefit Fox more than the other members of the venture?', ""JASON BAZINET: It will. I'll tell you the ratio. The ratio that we look at is if you look at a media company, how much of their affiliate fees are they getting from sports versus how much are they getting from non-sports? The more you get from sports, the simpler that ratio is for you to digest. So in the case of Fox, they could have 2 and 1/2 people spend down from a big fat bundle to this sports JV for every new person that signs up. If you look at someone like Warner, it's almost one for one."", ""So it definitely benefits firms like Fox and Disney much more than it does Warner and certainly more than people that aren't in the JV."", ""JOSH LIPTON: And, Jason, what's your best guess about what the price of this service would be? Some of the reports I've seen, I'm sure you've seen the same ones, maybe 40 to 50 per month. It sounds kind of pricey. But what do you think?"", ""JASON BAZINET: Well, I just added up all the affiliate fees that they're getting today that are-- for those linear channels that are going in the bundle and then marked it up 35%. And I came up with a $36 price point. So I think you could see something in the $35 range early on, maybe it goes to 40."", ""I don't think it gets to 50. What's interesting is if you took what we think this bundle will cost and you bought Paramount and Peacock on top of it, that would get you in the $50 range. But then you'd have 85% of all sports. If you include Amazon in that, you'd have 90%. So you're essentially talking about every piece of sports content for really something that I think will cost 52 bucks a month."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Jason, I want to move on to one of the other members of the joint venture, Warner Brothers Discovery. The stock trading at a record low after it reported disappointing numbers or numbers at least disappointing most of the Street. I believe you still have a buy rating on the stock. What's going to get it to go up here?"", ""JASON BAZINET: We do still have a buy rating. And our thesis is pretty simple. It was just that the amount of free cash flow that they would generate, they would use it to pay down debt. And essentially, your debt would become equity but even if your enterprise value didn't change."", ""What ended up happening today and it's happened for a couple quarters in a row is the EBITDA keeps missing Street's estimates. And what's essentially happening is the pressures on the linear ecosystem are just occurring faster than the improvements they're making on the streaming side. It's pretty much that simple."", 'JULIE HYMAN: And, Jason, so you have a buy on it. But what are the kind of downside risks you would flag, Jason?', ""JASON BAZINET: Well, more rapid cord cutting, you know, weaker viewership on linear television. And then on the other side of the ledger, the thing that-- most of the missed that they had in this quarter was really at the studio. That's a little bit of an aftershock of the strike and that will persist, I think, probably at least in the first quarter, maybe even the second quarter of this year. And then things should get back to normal where the studio begins to perform better."", 'JOSH LIPTON: Jason, always love having you on the show. Thanks so much for taking the time to chat with us. Have a great weekend.', 'JASON BAZINET: You bet. You bet. You, too.']"

Despite this success, the stock trades at a cheap 26 times free cash flow (Airbnb's earnings are currently skewed due to a couple of one-time events that render the price-to-earnings ratio useless)."", 'As a result of its cheap stock price, Airbnb has enacted a massive stock buyback program. Airbnb will spend up to $6 billion on stock repurchases. If Airbnb deploys those funds within a year, it will have a total effectiveness of just under $5 billion, as it spent $1.1 billion on stock-based compensation in 2023.', 'With Airbnb worth shy of $100 billion, that means shares outstanding will shrink by around 5% -- a huge win for investors. Because the business is doing well and management recognizes its cheap stock price, Airbnb looks like a solid buy now.', 'dLocal (NASDAQ: DLO) is a company few have heard about. It provides payment processing services for emerging market countries like Indonesia, India, Peru, and Egypt that large customers like Amazon, Nike, and Shopify can use to easily access these markets without developing their payment systems.', ""This product has proved wildly popular, and dLocal's revenue growth reflects that. In the third quarter, revenue rose 47% year over year thanks to total processed volume rising 69%. dLocal is also profitable and produced earnings per share of $0.14 in Q3."", ""Despite its success, dLocal's anonymity in the marketplace causes it to have a dirt-cheap stock price of 21 times forward earnings. That level of growth combined with a low price is a recipe for a stock that can skyrocket, which makes me want to own more dLocal shares."", 'Lastly is Visa (NYSE: V), the credit card processing giant. Visa is a staple in many portfolios, as the stock has consistently beaten the market over long periods thanks to constant growth, share buybacks, and improving profitability.', ""Its results for the fiscal first quarter of 2024, ended Dec. 31, 2023, continue that trend, with revenue growing 9% and EPS increasing 20% year over year.

In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', ""It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them."", 'On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.', 'Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.', 'There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date.

SBAC’s site-leasing revenues improved year over year on healthy leasing activity amid elevated tower space demand. Moreover, it has continued to benefit from the addition of sites to its portfolio.Over the preceding four quarters, SBAC’s AFFO per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on three occasions and missed once, the average beat being 1.65%.

With the advancement in mobile technology, such as 4G and 5G networks, and the proliferation of bandwidth-intensive applications, mobile data usage has increased significantly globally. The extensive use of network-intensive applications for activities like video conferencing and cloud services, coupled with the prevalence of hybrid work arrangements, has further contributed to this upward trend.Consequently, wireless carriers have increased their capital investments due to the growing demand resulting from global initiatives to roll out 4G and 5G networks, the expanding reach of wireless services and spectrum auctions. This heightened investment has supported the demand for SBA Communications' wireless communication infrastructure. This positive trend is likely to have stimulated robust tower leasing activities in the quarter, thereby enhancing the company's earnings for the period.Moreover, SBAC’s long-term (typically five to 10 years) tower leases with wireless service providers that have built-in rent escalators are likely to have supported stable site-leasing revenues for the company in the quarter, boosting its top line.SBAC’s solid balance sheet position is expected to have supported its investments in the existing 4G networks and efforts for 5G deployment. Also, asset-base expansion through acquisitions and development activities is likely to have given it an edge.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter site-leasing revenues, which account for the lion’s share of total revenues, is pegged at $640.45 million, indicating an increase from the year-ago quarter’s $609.61 million.However, site-development revenues are expected to be on the lower side in the fourth quarter. The consensus mark stands at $43.68 million, implying a decline from $76.49 million reported in the year-ago period.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total quarterly revenues is pegged at $683.81 million, calling for a slight year-over-year decline of 0.33%.The company’s activities during the to-be-reported quarter were adequate to garner analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly AFFO per share has been revised marginally upward to $3.32 over the past three months. Moreover, the figure implies year-over-year growth of 6.75%.However, high interest expenses and elevated churn in certain markets where the company operates might have been a deterrent for SBAC’s quarterly performance to some extent.For 2023, SBAC projected AFFO per share in the range of $12.91-$13.13. The company expected site-leasing revenues in the band of $2.51-$2.52 billion, site-development revenues between $195 million and $205 million and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $1.886-$1.896 billion.For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for AFFO per share has been revised a cent upward to $13.02 over the past month.

For the average American retiree who cannot afford to pick up and move over and over again, keeping these markers in mind is of the essence. As we delve into the considerations of retirement, it's crucial to explore the specific challenges faced by retirees in certain regions. In this context, we turn our attention to the Southeast, where despite its popularity, there are cities presenting distinct drawbacks for those seeking an ideal retirement location."", 'To facilitate present and potential retirees in navigating the Southeastern move, we have compiled a list of the 12 worst cities in the southeast for retirees.\xa0', 'Pixabay/Public Domain', 'To compile this list of the 12 worst cities in the Southeast for retirees, we consulted several sources including our list of 20 Worst Places to Retire in the US, FinanceBuzz, WalletHub, GOBankingRates, and Consumer Affairs. As the list of Southeastern states is often disputed, for the purpose of this article we took the definition of the American Association of Geographers. They define the following states as Southeastern: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia.\xa0', 'Once a list of Southeastern cities was compiled using these sources and this definition, they were then assigned scores.\xa0 These cities were ranked across four main factors, namely, the cost of living, how tax-friendly they were, their median house price, and their health rank. For reference, cost of living data was taken from Best Places, Smart Asset lent tax-friendliness categorizations, and median house prices were taken from Realtor. As for health scores, those were taken from WalletHub. Equal weightage was assigned to each of these factors, and the cities were ranked, selecting the bottom twelve for our list. As for the lowest-scoring city, it earned the number one spot on our list of worst cities in the Southeast for retirees. The resulting list is presented in descending order, with the lowest ranked city presented last.

Helped by a big move higher this week, when the company reported a 265% year-over-year growth in fiscal fourth-quarter revenue, shares are now up more than 55% year to date as of this writing."", ""But here's the crazy thing: In response to Nvidia's better-than-expected quarterly results, well over a dozen analysts have raised their 12-month price targets for the growth stock to levels well beyond where shares are trading now. Indeed, several analysts have raised their price targets for the stock to levels of $1,000 or higher."", ""Let's see what has some of the most bullish Nvidia analysts on Wall Street so upbeat."", ""One of the most-cited reasons analysts are optimistic about Nvidia stock following its latest earnings report is management's guidance. The company said it expected fiscal first-quarter revenue of about $24 billion -- more than $2 billion more than what the consensus analyst forecast was."", ""KeyBanc analyst John Vinh raised his 12-month price target on the stock from $740 to $1,100. His optimism, like analysts at Bernstein and Benchmark (analysts who raised their price target for Nvidia shares to $1,000 after the earnings report), was based on the company's incredible momentum, shown by its explosive sales growth in fiscal Q4 and management's fiscal first-quarter guidance."", ""Further, Vinh praised the company's surging sales in its data center specifically. Data center revenue rose 27% sequentially and a whopping 409% year over year in fiscal Q4."", 'In the company\'s fiscal fourth-quarter earnings release, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said demand for its data center products was coming from various industries. ""Our Data Center platform is powered by increasingly diverse drivers -- demand for data processing, training, and inference from large cloud-service providers and GPU-specialized ones, as well as from enterprise software and consumer internet companies,"" Jensen explained. Even demand from auto, financial services, and healthcare industries ""are now at the multibillion-dollar level,"" he added.', ""Combining a staggeringly good fiscal fourth quarter with management's guidance for fiscal first-quarter revenue to increase by about $16.8 billion year over year, it's easy to see why analysts are upbeat about the stock. But does this mean investors should still be piling in at the stock's current price?"", ""Sure, with Nvidia's earnings per share in fiscal 2024 soaring 586% to $11.93, the stock deserves to trade at a high valuation. Even more, the stock's current price-to-earnings multiple of 65 actually sounds quite reasonable for a stock with earnings growing this fast."", ""Despite these factors providing some support for the stock's current valuation, there's one looming concern that should keep investors on their toes: Much of the demand for Nvidia's data center products is driven by surging interest in generative artificial intelligence (AI). Not only is this a new technology that is incredibly difficult to predict, but it's tough to know what sales trends surrounding it will look like after this initial demand boom moderates at some point in the future when the industry for these products matures."", ""On a similar note, competition in the space could prove more adept than expected. This wouldn't be the first time Wall Street underestimates competition. Few would have guessed 20 years ago that Intel would fall from grace and be surpassed in size by multiple competitors."", ""Based on Nvidia's guidance for fiscal Q1 revenue and comments from management during the earnings call about some key products remaining supply constrained, there's no sign yet of a pullback in sales on the horizon. But this is a risk investors should be aware of."", ""For this reason, investors should tread carefully when reading about analysts' rosy 12-month price targets for the stock, opting to do their own due diligence and focus on the long term. Sure, maybe the stock is worth its current price tag. But it's OK to stay on the sidelines if you're unsure about the company's future.

Supermicro develops high-end AI servers powered by Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) top-tier GPUs, while Microsoft weaves OpenAI's generative AI tools into its own cloud-based services."", 'Supermicro went public at $8 per share with a valuation of $229 million in March 2007, but it now trades at about $750 a share with a market cap of $44 billion. That massive rally would have turned a $10,000 investment into more than $940,000.', 'Supermicro is still a lot smaller than Microsoft, which saw its market cap hit $3 trillion earlier this year, and smaller than its two larger competitors in the server market, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE) and Dell Technologies (NYSE: DELL). But if Supermicro continues firing on all cylinders, could it grow into a multi-trillion-dollar AI giant like Microsoft by 2050?', ""Supermicro is the world's third-largest server company with a market share of 5%, according to History-Computer. Dell leads the market with a 19% share, followed by HPE with a 13% share. Grand View Research expects the global server market to grow at a steady compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9% from 2023 to 2030."", 'Supermicro differentiates itself from its slower-growth competitors by mainly producing high-performance servers instead of low- to mid-range servers. Its design partnership with Nvidia grants it access to its top-tier GPUs before other server makers, and that competitive edge enabled it to capitalize on the explosive growth of the generative AI market.', ""Supermicro now generates roughly half of its revenue from dedicated AI servers powered by Nvidia's GPUs. Bank of America estimates that Supermicro already controls 10% of the dedicated AI server market -- and it expects its share to rise to 17% within the next three years as the entire niche market expands by 150%."", ""From fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2020 (which ended in June 2020), Supermicro's annual revenue grew at a CAGR of 17%. Its revenue dipped 7% in fiscal 2021 as the pandemic disrupted the global server market, but surged 46% in fiscal 2022 and grew 37% in fiscal 2023 as the AI market's growth accelerated. From fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026, analysts expect its revenue to continue rising at a CAGR of 42%."", ""Supermicro still doesn't seem expensive right now at 3 times this year's sales. Assuming its price-to-sales ratio holds steady, its market cap could reach $61 billion by fiscal 2026 -- marking a near-40% gain from its current levels."", ""But to reach Microsoft's current market cap of $3 trillion by 2050 with the same price-to-sales ratio, Supermicro would need to generate $1 trillion in revenue. To reach that target, it would need to grow at a 24-year CAGR of 18% from fiscal 2026."", ""That might seem achievable relative to its previous growth rates, but Supermicro could face some unpredictable challenges before 2050. Nvidia could deepen its ties with Dell, HPE, and other server makers to drive the growth of the data center GPU market. The AI market could stall out after the next few economic downturns, and Supermicro could be revalued as a legacy server maker like HPE and Dell -- which both trade at less than 1 time this year's sales -- instead of as a hypergrowth stock."", ""Simply put, Supermicro needs to keep hitting home runs over the next three decades to reach Microsoft's current market cap. But even if Supermicro somehow becomes a $3 trillion stock by 2050, Microsoft would likely be worth a lot more."", ""Supermicro is still a great growth stock, but it's futile to compare a server maker to a diversified software giant like Microsoft -- which owns the world's top PC operating system (Windows), the most popular productivity software suite (Office), and the second-largest public cloud platform (Azure). Supermicro certainly has the potential to become a trillion-dollar stock over the next few decades if it plays its cards right, but I doubt it will ever come close to matching Microsoft's valuations."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

The billionaire heads up Appaloosa Management -- the hedge fund he founded back in 1993. He has been called ""arguably the greatest hedge fund manager of his generation"" by Forbes magazine and has ""consistently outperformed his industry peers and the broader global markets since [Appaloosa\'s] inception,"" according to Carnegie Mellon University.', ""The results speak for themselves. Over the past three years, Appaloosa has outperformed the S&P 500 by nearly 17%, a remarkable accomplishment considering the macroeconomic downturn that plagued investors during 2022. Given his robust results, Tepper's stock picks might be worthy of additional review."", ""Appaloosa's portfolio is heavily weighted toward artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, with just five companies representing more than 46% of the fund's holdings to close out the fourth quarter:"", 'Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META): 11.6%', 'Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT): 11.3%', 'Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN): 10.6%', 'Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA): 6.9%', 'Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG): 5.7%', ""Keep in mind that hedge funds only report their holdings at the end of each quarter, and while these five stocks combined are largely unchanged compared to the third quarter, there's been a big shakeup among the holdings."", ""Meta Platforms continues to be Tepper's top holding, largely unchanged since the prior quarter. The company's history of using AI to surface relevant content for users on its social media sites is well documented. Furthermore, as the world's second-largest digital advertising platform, Meta makes the lion's share of its revenue from targeted advertising -- which is more effective when assisted by AI."", ""The company isn't resting on its laurels, recently releasing a suite of AI-powered tools for its advertisers, designed to help better reach their desired audience. Furthermore, its LLaMA AI (Large Language Model Meta AI) has become one of the leading open-source AI models and can be found on each of the major cloud infrastructure platforms -- for a price."", 'Meta gained 172% last year, so even as Tepper decreased his share count by 5%, the stock -- as a percentage of his portfolio -- is virtually unchanged.', 'Recognizing the vast opportunity ahead, Microsoft was quick off the blocks to integrate generative AI capabilities into its widely used workplace productivity tools and cloud infrastructure platform.', ""Microsoft's AI assistant, Copilot, is the standard-bearer for these innovations. Users are rushing to adopt Copilot thanks to its ability to increase user productivity. Several analysts have suggested that Copilot could generate incremental revenue of $100 billion by 2027. Perhaps as importantly, Copilot is having a halo effect on Microsoft's Azure, which outgrew its cloud infrastructure rivals in the fourth quarter. Furthermore, management credited 6 percentage points of that growth to increasing demand for AI."", ""Tepper was likely impressed by the company's strong move in AI and market share gains in the cloud. This gave him an incentive to increase his Microsoft share count by 4%, bringing it to 11.3% of his portfolio. It probably doesn't hurt that it's only selling at a slight premium to the overall market -- a bargain for potential growth of this magnitude."", ""Amazon has a trifecta of successful businesses, including its industry-leading e-commerce and cloud infrastructure operations, as well as the company's No. 3 digital advertising platform. Amazon has long been at the forefront of AI development, using these sophisticated algorithms to improve its operations, from making product recommendations to scheduling the most efficient delivery routes."", ""More recently, the company introduced Amazon Rufus, a digital shopping assistant designed to answer product questions, make comparisons, and make recommendations based on specified criteria. Furthermore, Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers have access to all the latest generative AI models, which could reignite the company's cloud growth."", ""Tepper obviously sees additional upside, as he increased Appaloosa's holdings by 5%, bringing Amazon to 10.6% of its total portfolio. And at just 2 times next year's sales, Amazon stock is a steal."", 'Nvidia is arguably the poster child for the AI revolution, as its graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard not only for gaming, but also for data centers, speeding information through the ether. Their unmatched computational horsepower has given the company a near monopoly on GPUs for both machine learning and data center use cases, with 95% of their respective markets. This supremacy gave the company a leg up in the generative AI market, which it has dominated from the outset.', ""However, Tepper cut its stake in Nvidia by 23%, knocking it down to 6.9% of Appaloosa's holdings, from 8.8% in the third quarter. However, Nvidia stock jumped 239% last year, so Tepper likely took the opportunity to lock in some profits."", 'Alphabet\'s Google Search acts as a funnel to fuel the company\'s industry-leading digital advertising business, which is also fueled by AI. The company was quick out of the gate to develop its generative AI functionality, infusing AI across a broad cross-section of its Android and Google products. Like Amazon and Microsoft, Google is one of the ""Big Three"" cloud providers, giving it the perfect channel to sell AI products to its cloud customers.', 'Recent developments include the debut of Gemini AI, which the company calls its ""largest and most capable AI model."" Google Cloud\'s Vertex AI continues to expand, providing access to 130 foundational AI models, with something to suit every need.', ""For all its potential, however, Appaloosa sold roughly 16% of its Alphabet holdings last quarter, bringing its stake to 5.7%, down from 7.2%. While Tepper hasn't addressed the move, it's likely he saw greater potential opportunities for Microsoft and Amazon."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

That's the message underscored by the astounding liftoff that on February 22, following its big-time earnings beat, boosted its market cap in a single day by 16% or $270 billion, and by mid-morning on February 23, added another 2% to hike its valuation to over $2 trillion."", ""Amidst the widespread drumbeat of praise, skeptical voices are few. But we've heard many times before that the first mover in a change-the-world thrust forward will maintain its top position far into the future, only to witness the shooting stars get smothered by disruptors lured by the leader's rich profitability, and the industry's immense promise. So to get a perspective on the likelihood that Nvidia likely faces that fate, I asked two veterans who've seen super-hot innovators rise and fall to provide their take to Fortune."", 'I put the question first to an expert who spans the worlds of academic finance and capital markets. Rob Arnott is founder and chairman of Research Affiliates, a firm that oversees investment strategies for $139 billion in mutual funds and ETFs. Arnott, alongside RA\'s CEO Chris Brightman, personally manages Pimco\'s $13 billion All Asset Fund. He\'s the father of ""fundamental indexing,"" an approach that weights companies in a portfolio by sales, net worth and other metrics measuring their size in the economy rather than by market cap, so that investors aren\'t trapped into putting more and more of their savings into the most expensive stocks. Arnott, who also served as editor-in-chief of the Financial Analysts Journal, oversees a group of PhDs at RA who conduct groundbreaking research, and consults regularly with the top minds at universities and business schools on ideas to refine RA\'s playbook.', 'In an email to Fortune, Arnott notes that the notion underpinning Nvidia\'s rise, that a single or even a couple of trailblazers that initially rule a new technology will maintain overwhelming leadership and deserve epic valuations, is another in a long series of ""big market delusions."" He says that today\'s situation mirrors the early days in everything from hand-held devices to personal computers to eCommerce to laying pipes for The Internet. The AI frenzy, he declares, recalls such crazes as ""the dot.com bubble in 1999 and EVs in 2021.""', 'For Arnott, when apparent breakthroughs first appeared and attracted strong investor backing you could usually count on three things: ""First, an exciting new industry is taking shape. Second, it will show impressive growth in the years ahead and probably change the world. Third, at the start, there\'s a handful of companies dominating this exciting new landscape.""', 'So in most cases, the promise eventually paid off. But that doesn\'t mean those who led the way greatly profited over the years ahead. ""It was usually not true that first, the new technology brought on change nearly as rapid as the markets predicted,"" he says. ""And second, it was often not true that these will be the dominant players 5 or 10 or even 20 years in the future."" Most of all, he adds, it\'s wrong to think that ""We can pay any price because these companies can achieve stupendous profits in due course. That\'s usually not true.""', 'Arnott describes the herd mentality that\'s so swelled Nvidia\'s stock price as ""the classic nature of bubbles. Disruptors change the world in wonderful ways, but they cannot succeed unless their customers are succeeding even more than they are, and disruptors are often themselves disrupted."" He points to Palm, dominant in handheld technology in 2000 losing out to BlackBerry in 2003, then BlackBerry losing to Apple\'s iPhone in 2008. Arnott\'s point is that competition eventually drives down a new industry\'s initially sterling profitability. The biggest beneficiaries are the customers that bank big productivity gains from advances in software or online advertising algorithms, and the sectors\' enduring champs are the players that keep innovating so that their products help customers work faster, better and cheaper.', 'Arnott agrees that fast-growers such as Nvidia deserve ""premium valuations."" But he argues that Nvidia\'s market cap is far, far too high versus the dollars it now generates in earnings. In his view, the risk Nvidia will follow so many others that have fallen from glory is much too great to justify its current PE (now at nearly 70). ""Nvidia\'s priced for perfection,"" he says. ""Its valuation leaves no room for shocks. Never short-sell bubble stocks when they\'re on a roll. But you don\'t have to own them, either.""', 'Jack Ciesielski, former author of the Analyst\'s Accounting Observer, has long been one of the most astute commentators on trends in the financial markets. And he agrees with Arnott that the same forces that hammered the early winners in other great leaps forward could well stymie Nvidia. ""Remember what happened in word processing and early PCs,"" he says. ""First, you had the likes of WordPerfect, Ami Pro and Lotus, along with Commodore, Radio Shack and Eagle. But they lost, and the prizes went to Apple and Microsoft. It was the same in the early days of the internet. The companies that laid the cable such as UUNET and Lucent got big valuations, and are no longer with us. But those that thrived turned out to be the Amazons, Googles and companies that used the pipes.""', 'Ciesielski observes that, ""It\'s not the first movers who usually win, it\'s the second movers"" who follow on with better strategies for winning customers and hatching the best new products. Plus, Nvidia is far from alone right now in minting AI software. Today, AMD and Intel are rolling out their own AI chips. As Arnott and Ciesielski both note, Nvidia\'s created a rage that all the software giants want ardently to join. Its takeoff is luring a herd of competitors set on winning their places as the princes or kings of AI. By attracting an onslaught, Nvidia\'s sorcerous success may be planting the seeds of its decline.', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

This is precisely the reason why Nvidia has witnessed a massive jump in its revenue and earnings in recent quarters.', ""Nvidia's AI graphics processing units (GPUs) are in such high demand relative to supply that customers are reportedly having to wait anywhere between 36 weeks and 52 weeks to get deliveries of its flagship H100 processors. Not surprisingly, the chipmaker is looking to ramp up the production capacity for those AI chips, which could allow it to sustain its outstanding share price rally."", ""However, Nvidia's 239% gains over the past year have left the stock trading at expensive valuations, with a price-to-sales ratio of 40 and a trailing earnings multiple of 96. Of course, Nvidia's forward earnings multiple of 36 shows that it is expected to deliver terrific bottom-line growth, while its 5-year price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of just 0.7 means that the stock is actually undervalued relative to the growth that it is expected to deliver."", ""Still, certain investors may want to look for cheaper alternative investments they can buy to profit from the AI boom. I'd point those investors toward Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT) -- a company that's going to benefit from Nvidia's efforts to increase its AI chip production."", 'Applied Materials produces semiconductor manufacturing equipment that allows chipmakers and foundries to fabricate chips and integrated circuits. It gets a nice chunk of its revenue from sales to Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, and Intel.', ""In its fiscal 2023 (which ended Oct. 29, 2023), Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, also known as TSMC, together accounted for 34% of Applied Materials' revenue. Intel's contribution was less than 10%. Given that these companies are looking to boost spending on semiconductor equipment in 2024, it was not surprising to see Applied Materials' latest results turning out to be better than expected."", ""Applied Materials released its fiscal 2024 first-quarter results on Feb. 15. For that period, which ended Jan. 28, the company's top line was nearly flat year-over-year at $6.7 billion -- but that was better than the $6.48 billion consensus estimate. Non-GAAP earnings increased 5% year over year to $2.13 per share, easily crushing the $1.91 per share Wall Street estimate."", 'Management\'s guidance turned out to be the icing on the cake. Applied Materials expects fiscal Q2 earnings of $1.97 per share at the midpoint of its guidance range, on revenue of $6.5 billion. Analysts were looking for $1.79 per share in earnings on $5.9 billion in revenue. Applied Materials, however, pointed out that ""there is a reacceleration of capital investment by cloud companies, fab utilization is increasing across all device types and memory inventory levels are normalizing,"" which explains why the company\'s outlook is better than expected.', ""AI, in particular, is increasing the company's addressable opportunity. For instance, Applied Materials estimates that the demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) deployed in AI servers could grow at an annualized rate of 50% in the coming years. The company also points out that the semiconductor die required to manufacture HBM is more than double the size of a standard dynamic random access memory (DRAM) die. So, chipmakers need to increase their capacities substantially to keep up with growing HBM demand."", 'Meanwhile, the advanced chip packaging process used for manufacturing AI chips is also giving Applied Materials a boost. On the latest earnings conference call, CEO Gary Dickerson said:', 'In fiscal 2024, we expect our HBM packaging revenues to be four times larger than last year, growing to almost $0.5 billion. And across all device types, we expect revenue from our Advanced Packaging Product portfolio to grow to approximately $1.5 billion.', 'Applied Materials also points out that the growing deployment of high-performance AI data centers will trigger volume production of gate-all-around (GAA) transistors, which are 30% more efficient than fin-shaped field-effect (FinFET) transistors. The company estimates that its addressable market could expand ""by $1 billion for every 100,000 wafer starts per month of [GAA transistor] capacity.""', 'Not surprisingly, Applied Materials\' largest customer, Samsung, has been quick to adopt GAA to make advanced chips using the 3nm process node. What\'s more, the market for GAA transistors is reportedly growing at an annual pace of 39%. This bodes well for Applied Materials as the company claims that it is ""on track to gain share and capture over 50% of the spending for the process equipment used in this new transistor module.""', ""Applied Materials is expecting $26.1 billion in fiscal 2024 revenue, which would be almost in line with its fiscal 2023 revenue of $26.5 billion. However, the company's first-quarter performance and the guidance for the current one suggest that it could deliver better-than-expected results in an improving spending environment."", ""It is also worth noting that Applied Materials' earnings increased on a year-over-year basis. Analysts, however, are anticipating that in fiscal 2024, its earnings will drop to $7.73 per share from $8.05 per share last year.

Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Thus, you can purchase Genuine Parts' shares before the 29th of February in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 1st of April."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.00 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$4.00 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Genuine Parts stock has a trailing yield of around 2.7% on the current share price of US$147.88. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Genuine Parts ', ""Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. That's why it's good to see Genuine Parts paying out a modest 41% of its earnings. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Dividends consumed 57% of the company's free cash flow last year, which is within a normal range for most dividend-paying organisations."", ""It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. For this reason, we're glad to see Genuine Parts's earnings per share have risen 13% per annum over the last five years. Genuine Parts is paying out a bit over half its earnings, which suggests the company is striking a balance between reinvesting in growth, and paying dividends. This is a reasonable combination that could hint at some further dividend increases in the future."", ""Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Genuine Parts has lifted its dividend by approximately 6.4% a year on average. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders."", 'From a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Genuine Parts? Earnings per share have grown at a nice rate in recent times and over the last year, Genuine Parts paid out less than half its earnings and a bit over half its free cash flow. Overall we think this is an attractive combination and worthy of further research.', ""With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Genuine Parts you should know about."", ""Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

Although the dividend is now higher, the yield is only 1.7%, which is below the industry average.', ' See our latest analysis for Fox ', 'It would be nice for the yield to be higher, but we should also check if higher levels of dividend payment would be sustainable. Before making this announcement, Fox was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.', 'Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 121.1% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 14% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.', ""Even though the company has been paying a consistent dividend for a while, we would like to see a few more years before we feel comfortable relying on it. Since 2019, the annual payment back then was $0.46, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $0.52. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 2.5% over that duration. We like that the dividend hasn't been shrinking. However we're conscious that the company hasn't got an overly long track record of dividend payments yet, which makes us wary of relying on its dividend income."", ""Investors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. However, things aren't all that rosy. Fox has seen earnings per share falling at 6.6% per year over the last five years. If earnings continue declining, the company may have to make the difficult choice of reducing the dividend or even stopping it completely - the opposite of dividend growth. Earnings are forecast to grow over the next 12 months and if that happens we could still be a little bit cautious until it becomes a pattern."", ""In summary, while it's always good to see the dividend being raised, we don't think Fox's payments are rock solid. The payments haven't been particularly stable and we don't see huge growth potential, but with the dividend well covered by cash flows it could prove to be reliable over the short term. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks."", 'Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach.

One is a lot of investors don\'t believe that consumers are going to buy it because it only contains about half of the sports rights. And the second reason is they fear that a lot of people will buy it, but they\'re going to spin down from their big, fat pay TV package to something that\'s cheaper and thinner, and that\'s going to hurt Fox. That\'s why Fox traded down on the news. Our thesis is pretty simple. A lot of people are going to buy this and it\'s actually going to bring in cord cutters, cord nevers that have never had a pay TV subscription. It\'s actually going to be positive for the stock.""', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino"", '[AUDIO LOGO]', ""JOSH LIPTON: Shares of Fox scoring an upgrade today, thanks to optimism on the entertainment company's planned sports streaming bundle with Warner Brothers Discovery and Disney's ESPN. Joining us now is the analyst behind that call, Jason Bazinet, Citi Managing Director. Jason, always good to have you on the show. So you upgrade Fox to a buy, Jason. Your target goes to 35. How come, Jason? Walk us through the argument."", ""JASON BAZINET: Well, there's a lot of skepticism about the efficacy of this sports bundle on two fronts. One is a lot of investors don't believe that consumers are going to buy it, because it only contains about half of the sports rights. And the second reason is they fear that a lot of people will buy it. But they're going to spend down from their big fat pay TV package to something that's cheaper and thinner. And that's going to hurt Fox. And that's why Fox traded down on the news."", ""Our thesis is pretty simple. A lot of people are going to buy this. And it's actually going to bring in cord cutters, cord nevers that have never had a pay TV subscription. And it's actually going to be positive for stock-- for the stock."", 'JULIE HYMAN: And is it going to benefit Fox more than the other members of the venture?', ""JASON BAZINET: It will. I'll tell you the ratio. The ratio that we look at is if you look at a media company, how much of their affiliate fees are they getting from sports versus how much are they getting from non-sports? The more you get from sports, the simpler that ratio is for you to digest. So in the case of Fox, they could have 2 and 1/2 people spend down from a big fat bundle to this sports JV for every new person that signs up. If you look at someone like Warner, it's almost one for one."", ""So it definitely benefits firms like Fox and Disney much more than it does Warner and certainly more than people that aren't in the JV."", ""JOSH LIPTON: And, Jason, what's your best guess about what the price of this service would be? Some of the reports I've seen, I'm sure you've seen the same ones, maybe 40 to 50 per month. It sounds kind of pricey. But what do you think?"", ""JASON BAZINET: Well, I just added up all the affiliate fees that they're getting today that are-- for those linear channels that are going in the bundle and then marked it up 35%. And I came up with a $36 price point. So I think you could see something in the $35 range early on, maybe it goes to 40."", ""I don't think it gets to 50. What's interesting is if you took what we think this bundle will cost and you bought Paramount and Peacock on top of it, that would get you in the $50 range. But then you'd have 85% of all sports. If you include Amazon in that, you'd have 90%. So you're essentially talking about every piece of sports content for really something that I think will cost 52 bucks a month."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Jason, I want to move on to one of the other members of the joint venture, Warner Brothers Discovery. The stock trading at a record low after it reported disappointing numbers or numbers at least disappointing most of the Street. I believe you still have a buy rating on the stock. What's going to get it to go up here?"", ""JASON BAZINET: We do still have a buy rating. And our thesis is pretty simple. It was just that the amount of free cash flow that they would generate, they would use it to pay down debt. And essentially, your debt would become equity but even if your enterprise value didn't change."", ""What ended up happening today and it's happened for a couple quarters in a row is the EBITDA keeps missing Street's estimates. And what's essentially happening is the pressures on the linear ecosystem are just occurring faster than the improvements they're making on the streaming side. It's pretty much that simple."", 'JULIE HYMAN: And, Jason, so you have a buy on it. But what are the kind of downside risks you would flag, Jason?', ""JASON BAZINET: Well, more rapid cord cutting, you know, weaker viewership on linear television. And then on the other side of the ledger, the thing that-- most of the missed that they had in this quarter was really at the studio. That's a little bit of an aftershock of the strike and that will persist, I think, probably at least in the first quarter, maybe even the second quarter of this year. And then things should get back to normal where the studio begins to perform better."", 'JOSH LIPTON: Jason, always love having you on the show. Thanks so much for taking the time to chat with us.

But the leaned-out startup is making some progress in its pivot to energy distribution through a fuel-agnostic power generator.', 'Whether the plan is sufficient to generate revenue and perhaps attract a buyer for the once high-flying special purpose acquisition company are the big unknowns.', 'The Karno generator, which Hyliion purchased from GE in August 2022 for its since-canceled Hypertruck ERX, qualifies for $40,000 in incentives this year under the Inflation Reduction Act. The system is more expensive than diesel but cheaper than a fuel cell, CEO Thomas Healy told me this week. He declined to specify the price.', 'Hyliion has attracted nascent customer interest in the technology that has been facetiously compared to Doc Brown’s flux capacitor in the “Back to the Future“ movie trilogy.', 'That Hyliion has the resources to try another business line comes from practicing financial discipline. By guarding a large part of the $560 million in proceeds from its reverse merger with Tortoise Acquisition Corp. 3 ½ years ago, Hyliion has a second chance that some profligate SPAC-backed startups squandered.', 'Had Hyliion pursued the Hypertruck ERX, it would have burned through its cash hoard at a faster clip.', '“Our decision around [exiting] powertrain was more focused on the major shifts happening in all electrification,” Healy said. “Volumes aren’t at levels that anyone was expecting.”', 'A court challenge delaying California’s Advanced Clean Fleets rule contributes to some rethinking on electric trucks. The Minnesota Trucking Association this month released a report cautioning fleets to adopt a “go slow” approach on regional and long-haul electric trucks.', 'The Hypertruck addressed the long-haul challenge by pairing a natural gas generator with an electric powertrain that would convert natural gas to electricity on board and allow 1,000 miles between fill-ups.', 'But the first-generation Hypertruck proved complex and expensive. The price topped $400,000 after a yearlong delay in getting parts and paying up to get small quantities during the pandemic. Fleets liked the Hypertruck enough to order ones and twos, but not enough to make it profitable.', 'Healy saw Karno as an advanced generator for the next-gen Hypertruck. Hyliion retains intellectual property that could be used later. Or it could be sold or licensed to bring in cash.', '“Over time, we will look to reduce how much IP coverage we have just from a cash conservation standpoint,” Healy said. “You don’t need as much if you’re not in that business. We’ll keep the parts that we see as really relevant.”', 'The idea of Karno as a stand-alone electric generator was always in the back of Healy’s mind. Now it is front and center.', 'If it proves reliable, Karno could become a staple to make electricity for the growing number of electric truck infrastructure developers. Bringing power to warehouses and capturing and converting flare gases from oil and gas fields and landfills are other uses.', '“The EV charging space is one we’re heavily pursuing,” Healy said. “The problem we’ll run into is the volume they’re looking for. It is a lot of power for our early production. We don’t want to be solely dependent on that market because of how much volatility we’ve seen in that space.”', 'Well-heeled infrastructure developers like TerraWatt Infrastructure, Forum Mobility, WattEV, Zeem Solutions and Voltera could augment utility-provided grid power with Karno technology.', 'One developer — Healy would not say which — told him its original thinking around Karno would be to use it while waiting for full grid energizing of a site, then move it to another site. Now it is thinking of keeping it in one place and ordering a second Karno for the additional site.', 'Hyliion successfully tested Karno in converting flare gas to electricity in the Permian Basin. Backup power for data centers is another potential market. A successful Karno could push legacy players like Cummins, Generac, Caterpillar and Kohler.', '“We can pose a real competitive threat to the incumbent players if we can execute on the generator as we think we can,” Healy said.', 'Hyliion began 2024 with $291 million in capital and expects to invest $40 million in Karno development this year. Its board of directors hasn’t set a deadline, but it wants to see revenue and a path to gross margin. Or it wants the company’s cash returned to shareholders. The stock price Wednesday hovered around $1.38. Before the merger in October 2020, it traded above $50.', '“We expect that the reduction in expenses associated with the wind-down of our powertrain segment will result in approximately a 70% reduction in cash burn this year compared to last,” Healy told the one analyst who dialed into the company’s Q4 earnings call on Valentine’s Day.', 'In a highly unusual move for a pre-revenue company, Hyliion repurchased $20 million of its own stock in Q4 because shares were trading at one-third the value of just its cash and investments. The same board that held Healy accountable to make the ERX viable or drop it encouraged the share repurchase.', 'Since that time, two high-profile board members — former U.S. Transportation secretaries Andrew Card and Elaine Chao — have left the board.', 'The presence of Cummins Inc. on the board and in management is noteworthy.', 'Former Meritor — now part of Cummins Inc. — CEO Jay Craig chairs the board; former Cummins President Richard Freedland is a director. And Hyliion earlier this month hired Govindaraj “Govi” Ramasamy as its chief commercial officer. He spent the previous 17 years at Cummins in power generation.', 'Hyliion has both worked with and been challenged by Cummins. The two worked together to certify Cummins’ 12-liter natural gas engine for the Hypertruck. But the California Air Resources Board granted only one year of emissions certification.', 'Cummins is discontinuing the 12-liter engine. To keep going with the Hypertruck, Hyliion would have had to certify the 15-liter natural gas version going into production this year.', 'With robust horsepower and torque ratings, Cummins’ 15-liter natural gas offering — the first of several fuel-agnostic offerings that includes a hydrogen version in 2027 — is attracting heavy fleet interest. Jose Samperio, Cummins vice president of on-highway products, told me in October the 15-liter could reach 10% market share where natural gas offerings historically command 2%.', 'As for Karno, it could be a nice fit for Cummins, which makes a lot of diesel-powered generators and has a growing data center business. But expect Cummins to allow Hyliion to pay for Karno’s development and validation before getting out its checkbook.', '“The definition of being a public company is you’re always for sale,” Healy said. “But it’s not something that we’re actively pursuing at this time.”', 'Stay tuned.', 'That’s it for this week.

The Zacks Media Conglomerates industry, to which Disney belongs, has gained 8.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?"", ""While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making."", 'Revisions to Earnings Estimates', ""Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements."", 'For the current quarter, Disney is expected to post earnings of $1.04 per share, indicating a change of +11.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +5.9% over the last 30 days.', 'For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.56 points to a change of +21.3% from the prior year.

Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.1%.', ""With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.

After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth."", 'For Disney, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $22.05 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +1.1%.

Based on this payment, the dividend yield for the company will be 4.2%, which is fairly typical for the industry."", ' See our latest analysis for Exelon ', ""We like to see a healthy dividend yield, but that is only helpful to us if the payment can continue. Based on the last payment, Exelon's earnings were much higher than the dividend, but it wasn't converting those earnings into cash flow. No cash flows could definitely make returning cash to shareholders difficult, or at least mean the balance sheet will come under pressure."", 'Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 20.6%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 52% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.', ""The company's dividend history has been marked by instability, with at least one cut in the last 10 years. Since 2014, the annual payment back then was $1.24, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $1.52. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 2.1% a year over that time. We're glad to see the dividend has risen, but with a limited rate of growth and fluctuations in the payments the total shareholder return may be limited."", ""With a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share is growing, which could point to a growing dividend in the future. Earnings per share has been crawling upwards at 2.4% per year. Growth of 2.4% per annum is not particularly high, which might explain why the company is paying out a higher proportion of earnings. This could mean the dividend doesn't have the growth potential we look for going into the future."", 'Overall, this is probably not a great income stock, even though the dividend is being raised at the moment. While the low payout ratio is a redeeming feature, this is offset by the minimal cash to cover the payments. We would probably look elsewhere for an income investment.', ""Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance.

GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Sign with PRU.', ""On February 21, 2024, Prudential Financial Inc (NYSE:PRU), a leading global financial services firm, filed its annual 10-K report, revealing a comprehensive overview of its operations and financial health. With a strong presence in the United States, Asia, Europe, and Latin America, Prudential Financial offers a wide range of financial products and services, including life insurance, annuities, and investment management through its subsidiaries and affiliates. As of December 31, 2023, the company boasts an impressive $1.450 trillion in assets under management, demonstrating its significant role in the global financial landscape. The filing also highlights the company's strategic focus on becoming less market-sensitive and its commitment to sustainable long-term growth, despite facing a competitive and rapidly changing industry."", ""Asset Management Powerhouse: Prudential Financial Inc's investment management business, PGIM, stands as a testament to the company's financial prowess, managing over $1.5 trillion in assets. This not only provides a stable revenue stream but also positions Prudential as a leading player in the global investment market. PGIM's diversified global platform and strong investment performance are key drivers of Prudential's overall success, offering a competitive edge in attracting and retaining top-tier investment talent."", 'Robust International Presence: With approximately 40% of its earnings stemming from international operations, Prudential has successfully established a strong market position in Japan and is actively expanding in high-growth emerging markets. This geographical diversification mitigates risks associated with market concentration and allows Prudential to tap into new customer bases, further bolstering its global footprint and revenue diversification.', ""Market Sensitivity: Despite efforts to de-risk its business model, Prudential's profitability remains sensitive to market fluctuations, particularly in interest rates and equity markets. This sensitivity can lead to volatility in earnings and poses challenges in maintaining consistent financial performance, especially in an environment of economic uncertainty."", ""Operational Risks: The recent disclosure of a cybersecurity incident, although not materially impacting the company's operations, underscores the operational risks Prudential faces in an increasingly digital world. The necessity to continuously invest in cybersecurity measures and maintain robust risk management practices adds to operational costs and requires constant vigilance to safeguard against potential breaches."", ""Emerging Market Expansion: Prudential's strategic focus on emerging markets presents significant growth opportunities. By leveraging its needs-based selling approach and focusing on protection products, Prudential can capitalize on demographic shifts and evolving consumer financial needs, particularly in regions like Asia and Latin America where insurance penetration rates are lower."", 'Product and Service Innovation: The shift towards less interest rate-sensitive products and the adoption of technology-enabled channels open avenues for Prudential to innovate its product offerings. This aligns with changing consumer preferences for simpler, more accessible financial solutions and positions Prudential to meet the demands of a younger, tech-savvy customer base.', ""Competitive Landscape: Prudential operates in a highly competitive industry, facing challenges from both traditional financial institutions and emerging fintech and insurtech companies. These competitors, often with advanced technological capabilities and innovative business models, could potentially disrupt the market and erode Prudential's market share."", ""Regulatory and Environmental Risks: The company is subject to evolving regulatory environments and ESG standards, which can impact business practices and investor perceptions. Additionally, climate change poses both direct and indirect risks to Prudential's investment portfolio and operational resilience, necessitating strategic responses to these growing concerns."", ""In conclusion, Prudential Financial Inc (NYSE:PRU) exhibits a strong market position with its expansive asset management capabilities and international reach. However, the company must navigate market sensitivities, operational risks, and a fiercely competitive landscape. Opportunities for growth in emerging markets and through product innovation are promising, yet threats from regulatory changes and environmental challenges loom. Prudential's strategic focus on de-risking its business and capitalizing on high-growth areas suggests a proactive approach to leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses, while remaining vigilant of the opportunities and threats ahead."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

It established the industry's first fixed-plus-variable dividend policy. The framework featured a fixed base quarterly dividend and a variable dividend of up to 50% of its free cash flow. "", ""Several oil stocks have since taken a page from Devon Energy's playbook by launching similar fixed-plus-variable dividend policies, including Chord Energy (NASDAQ: CHRD). That oil producer is now taking another page out of Devon's playbook by agreeing to acquire Enerplus (NYSE: ERF), a company Devon had also offered to buy. Here's a look at how the deal will benefit dividend investors and where Devon might turn next to fuel its payout."", ""Chord Energy is acquiring Enerplus in a cash-and-stock deal, valuing the target at about $3.9 billion (including the assumption of debt). It's paying 90% of the $3.4 billion equity value in stock (0.10125 of its shares for each share of Enerplus) and the other 10% in cash ($1.84 per share). The transaction will create an $11 billion oil and gas company by enterprise value."", 'Enerplus is a near-perfect strategic fit for Chord Energy:', ""As the map on that slide shows, the acquisition will increase Chord Energy's acreage position in the Williston Basin. The combined company will have nearly 1.3 million net acres and produce 279,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d). That will make it the top producer in the region. The increased scale drives Chord's view that it can capture up to $150 million in annual cost savings. While Enerplus also owns a non-operated position in the gas-rich Marcellus shale, Chord could seek to sell those assets to further enhance its financial position."", ""The cost savings from the combination will help increase Chord's free cash flow. The combined company expects to produce around $1.2 billion in free cash this year (up from $800 million as a stand-alone company). Chord intends to return 75% of that money to shareholders via a base dividend, variable dividends, and share repurchases. "", 'Chord reaffirmed its current base dividend rate ($5 per share annually). Meanwhile, it recently declared its latest variable dividend at $2 per share for the fourth quarter. Annualizing the most recent combined payment puts its dividend yield at 8%. Given its enhanced free cash flow, Chord could continue paying significant dividends following its Enerplus merger. ', ""Reuters reported earlier this month that Devon approached Enerplus with an acquisition offer. Buying Enerplus would have enabled Devon to significantly enhance its scale in the Williston Basin, where it's a much smaller producer (54,000 BOE/d compared to Enerplus' 78,000 BOE/d). "", ""Devon was also reportedly among the many companies evaluating a potential offer to acquire CrownRock before Occidental Petroleum's $12 billion deal. CrownRock would have significantly bolstered its already world-class position in the Delaware Basin. Reuters also reported that Devon had discussed a merger with Marathon Oil. However, those talks ended because they could not agree on terms. "", 'Devon is one of many oil companies seeking to participate in the current consolidation wave washing over the oil patch. Exxon kicked things off by agreeing to acquire Pioneer Natural Resources for over $60 billion last year. Chevron followed with a deal to buy Hess for around $60 billion, while Diamondback Energy agreed to a $26 billion takeover of privately held Endeavor Energy Resources. ', ""Even with so many targets taken, Devon has plenty of options. It could circle back to Marathon. The multi-basin producer would be an excellent strategic fit. It could also consider Permian Resources, which, like Devon, has a strong position in the Delaware Basin, or Matador Resources, which operates in the Delaware, Eagle Ford (where Devon also operates), and the gassier Haynesville shale and Cotton Valley plays. The key will be to find a target that's a strong strategic fit to enhance its scale and free cash flow. Securing the right deal at the right price could enable Devon to boost its free cash flow, giving it more money to pay dividends. "", ""Devon Energy's transformational merger with WPX Energy in 2021 created a lot of value for shareholders. It enhanced its free cash flow, giving it the fuel to launch its very popular fixed-plus-variable dividend framework. Others, like Chord Energy, have copied that playbook. It's now acquiring the same company Devon wanted to buy, which should fuel more dividends for its investors."", ""However, losing out on another acquisition isn't the end of the world for Devon. There are still plenty of opportunities to participate in the current consolidation wave. It could deliver another transformational phase of value creation if it can wait for the right deal to emerge."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Devon Energy right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Devon Energy, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Devon Energy wasn’t one of them.

If you would like to skip our detailed analysis of the board game industry, you can directly go to the 5 Best Board Games for Families.', 'Technology may have replaced multiple entertainment avenues, but board games have managed to hold out for a long time. According to Fortune Business Insights, the global board games industry was valued at $11.08 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow to $26.04 billion by 2030, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.36% over the projected period. While most publications credit the 2020 lockdowns for this growth and revival of the board gaming industry, the market has flourished due to a myriad of other pertinent factors as well. As relevant as the ‘pandemic effect’ is, board games have managed to stay in the limelight through a culmination of several reasons, many of which were revealing their impacts even before the COVID-19 lockdowns.\xa0', 'One of the most significant impacts has been generated by the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter, which has brought publishing access to indie game designers without needing hefty funding. According to the company’s own data, over 84,000 gaming projects have been launched on the platform since it began in 2009, out of which 40,892 have already reached their funding goal. Kickstarter allows gaming enthusiasts to get early access to exclusive games and enables customers to have a say in the design and subsequent updates. This feedback-mechanism model results in games that are conducive to public demand and responsive to the gamers’ needs. More than 2,300 board gaming projects are about to begin their funding on Kickstarter in the coming months. Gaming connoisseurs can also look at the 15 Best Video Games Coming Out in 2024.\xa0', 'Kickstarter is not the only platform making waves in this space; even newbies like Gamefound are generating a considerable impact. Despite being relatively new in the space, the company generated $56 million in board gaming funding in 2023, as per data shared by Polygon. When this is added to the $226.2 million revenue that Kickstart engendered, 2023 can be considered one of the top years for board gaming. Gamefound’s most funded game of 2023 was Nemesis: Retaliation, which generated around $12 million. Several other games raised funds in the $1-4 million bracket.\xa0', 'Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter have helped a plethora of creative projects that might not have been economically feasible otherwise, and they have also led to a rise in the popularity of board game-specific YouTube channels, such as Games4Two and The Dice Tower. As themed and niche board games become more accessible to the everyday consumer; people have something to look forward to in the gaming space. The world’s largest board gaming convention, Internationale Spieltage SPIEL, or the Essen Game Fair, launched over 1,000 games during its 2023 iteration alone, welcoming 193,000 gamers from 85 countries. As board gamers gather for four days to try out hundreds of new games, one idea is reiterated repeatedly: in the 21st century, board games are more than just dice rolls and luck-based turns.\xa0', ""Gaming giants like Hasbro Inc (NASDAQ:HAS) have been at the forefront of benefitting from the rising trend of themed board games. To ensure people don’t get tired of playing the same version of Monopoly, Hasbro Inc (NASDAQ:HAS) has created over 50 variations of the classic game, including special editions dedicated to Fortnite, Star Wars, and Game of Thrones. Another classic by Hasbro Inc (NASDAQ:HAS), Dungeons & Dragons, will be celebrating its 50th anniversary in 2024, for which the company has planned a year-long celebration beginning in March. According to a company statement published on February 12, the company will be holding events worldwide, offering unique experiences inspired by the game's history. Rich and dynamic events like these enable classic games to stay hyped even years after their original release.\xa0"", ""The popularity of DnD also points to another rising phenomenon in the board game industry: the role of media. Stranger Things came out in July of 2016 on Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), bearing a premise based around the classic role-player game, which many also consider the first of its type. According to the Daily Dot, Google searches for DnD rose 20% during the show's first two seasons and another 50% during later seasons. The creators behind the game also came out with a DnD Stranger Things tie-in version in 2019, just before the show’s third season aired. This unlikely connection between modern media and an older form of entertainment might be surprising, but it has worked wonders for classic games like this one.\xa0You can also read about the best fighting video games of all time."", ""Building onto our previous example, DnD is not the only board game that has witnessed a boost due to a popular TV show. According to Fortune Business Insights, chess sales by Goliath Games were up 1,000% in November 2020, while chess sales on eBay witnessed a 215% growth around the same time. These drastic numbers were the product of the Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) series The Queen’s Gambit, which came out in October 2020. Another report by the Michigan Journal of Economics states that Chess.com, a popular online site for the game, added a whopping 2.8 million member accounts following the show's release. Thus, in a span of five years, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) contributed to massive growth in two classic board games, which had otherwise become pretty niche.\xa0"", 'At the end of the day, one of the biggest changes in the board game industry is the addition of diversity. It was harder to feign interest in tabletop gaming when the only available options were the same games that had been on the market for decades, but today, there are new experiences to invest in every day. On top of that, there is a game for every age bracket, interest, and group size. Board games span themes of every category, from communicating with ‘ghosts’ to trading on the stock floor - which means that even those interested in real-world subject matters such as stock trading, real estate, or financial markets, can find tabletop games suited to their passions.\xa0', 'Games such as Acquire, Panic on Wall Street, and Raccoon Tycoon are some of the leaders in this category. The fact that these board games are also accessible to younger teens means they can even be enjoyed by the whole family. The bottom line is that the gaming industry has expanded enough that games are not just limited to one avenue anymore. Because games exist on such a vast range of topics now, most people can find a point of entry into board gaming.', 'According to an article published by the Washington Post on December 24, 2022, Elan Lee, the creator of the popular card game Exploding Kittens, mentioned that while classic games are still popular, these new board game ideas have filled a hole in the industry. According to Lee and Rodney Smith, the founder of a YouTube channel dedicated to gaming, before, board games were mainly about brute competition, whereas today, several of them come with a cooperative gameplay mode. This essentially allows families to experience a different kind of gaming world together, enabling them to form memories.\xa0', ""All these changing industry trends have made board gaming a wholesome family experience again, leading to a rise in the demand for the best board games for families to enjoy together.

The growing complexity of semiconductors needed for AI, hyperscale computing, and beyond have transformed Cadence into an invaluable partner for many firms and a key cog in the broader tech and chip ecosystem.', 'Cadence boasts Nvidia as a customer because the GPU and AI chip powerhouse loves its simulation capabilities. The intelligent system design powerhouse might become even more important as everyone else races to catch Nvidia and design ever-more complex and microscopic chips in the sub-5 nanometer space.', 'Cadence is one of the few major players in the vital electronic design automation world. Cadence’s fiscal 2023 revenue climbed by 15% to help boost its adjusted earnings by 20%. Cadence also topped our Q4 sales estimate on February 12 and it beat on the bottom line once again, having now surpassed our EPS estimates for over five years running.', 'Cadence’s revenue benefited from higher customer demand amid robust design activity and strong operational execution. CDNS ended 2023 with a record backlog of $6 billion and current remaining performance obligations of $3.2 billion. CDNS has also expanded its well-established partnerships with the likes of Nvidia and Arm.', 'Cadence provided solid 2024 guidance as it grows alongside “secular trends of digital transformation, hyperscale computing and autonomous driving, all bolstered by an AI super-cycle, continue to fuel strong broad-based design activity,” CEO Anirudh Devgan said on its fourth quarter earnings call. “We continue successfully executing to our Intelligent System Design strategy, that triples our TAM (total addressable market) opportunity while greatly expanding our portfolio.”', 'Cadence is projected to post 12% higher sales growth in FY24 and then boost its top line by another 12% in FY25 to reach $5.15 billion.', 'Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings are projected to climb 14% this year and 18% in fiscal 2025.

The company manufactures asphalt plant equipment sold into the highway construction industry. The company recently reported a 44% increase in backlog as well as a balance sheet containing $104.8 m of cash and marketable securities with $0 debt. The greatest risk factor is the timing of backlog conversion to sales which could result in lumpy sales.', 'Another theme which continues to be top of mind is cyber security.

And there are more worries around critical infrastructure attacks like the nation’s electric grid.', 'Grandview Research projects that the global cyber security market will grow at a CAGR of 12.3% through 2030. It should also be noted that the SEC adopted a new rule in July of 2023 requiring companies to disclose any material cyber security incidents so a more heightened awareness around cyber security as it relates to brand preservation may ensue.', 'We believe CSP Inc. is a microcap name that could benefit from these industry tailwinds. The company’s higher margin software business serving the critical infrastructure of industries or OT (Operational Technology) like pharma and utilities is gaining momentum and represents over 10% of revenue.', 'Some deals were pushed out of the December quarter resulting in a YOY sales decline but are expected to land this quarter. The biggest risk factor is the intense competition in the cyber security software space and ongoing worries that a major tech player could develop their own software.', 'Lastly, and unfortunately, we note the growing level of military conflicts around the world. While US defense spending remains robust, highlighted by the recent $886 B defense policy bill, we find recent NATO spending and body language especially remarkable. Eighteen of the member states have pledged spending 2% of GDP in 2024 on defense vs. only seven states back in 2022.', 'We believe M-tron Industries should benefit from this increased military spending. The company manufactures the electronic components focused on frequency and spectrum that are supplied to the large US defense companies which ultimately contract with the US DOD and foreign allies. Backlog increased 14% YOY to $50.3 million and Gross margin has improved 1040 bps YOY to 42.8% due to efficiencies and the exit from low margin businesses.', 'The company has also launched on average 260 new products per year over the last 5 years and is now producing more $1 m revenue products.

Buying dividend stocks that grow their payout produces returns far above what non-dividend-paying stocks generate. Yet you should only buy those companies that can support their dividends.', 'Southern Copper (NYSE:SCCO) just announced it was slashing its payout 20%. The dividend is going from $1.00 per share to 80 cents per share. Although it had been rising over the past few years, the dividend could fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Because commodity stocks can be volatile, the payout was not sustainable in this case.', 'The miner produced earnings of $3.32 per share last year but paid out $4.00 per share in dividends. A more meaningful comparison shows SCCO stock generated only $3.32 per share in free cash flow (FCF). Thus, paying out more than you earn is a prescription for problems.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'But the copper miner’s investors are not alone in facing dividend cuts. Let’s examine three more companies that could slash their payout.', 'Source: Nico Bekasinski / Shutterstock.com', 'The dividend at Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) survived another quarter.', 'The toymaker announced its shareholders would receive 70 cents per share. That is the same amount they have received each quarter for the past two years. However, it might be difficult to maintain that rate in the future, despite management reiterating support for the payout.', 'Hasbro sales fell 23% in the all-important fourth quarter, which includes the Christmas holiday season. Also, it recorded operating losses of $1.2 billion. So, the continued downturn is forcing the company to take an axe to costs. In December, it announced it was firing 900 employees and took aggressive actions to reduce inventory levels. Now, management believes that puts the business in a better position to support the dividend.', 'Although Hasbro is paying down debt, it still has $3 billion on the ledger sheet. In contrast, it owns just $545 million in cash and equivalents. The company is only generating around $1.75 per share in FCF but paying out $2.80 per share in dividends. Even analysts aren’t sure Hasbro can maintain the payout.', 'On the earnings conference call it was noted rival Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) was unable to engineer a turnaround until it freed up cash by cutting its dividend. Hasbro management simply maintains the actions it has taken will be enough to support the payout. Investors might not want to put much faith in that.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'Medical marijuana real estate investment trust (REIT) Innovative Industrial Properties (NYSE:IIPR) has proved more resilient than many expected. It underscores why I felt it was an unstoppable stock to buy back in November. Shares are up 14% since then, in line with the S&P 500.', 'As a REIT, though, it is required to pay out most of its profits as distributions to shareholders. Although it has raised the dividend consistently since going public in 2016, growing it at a 42% annual rate, it won’t be able to maintain that rate. In fact, the December payment of $1.82 per share was a mere 1% increase over the prior rate. With inflation running over 3%, it means investors are receiving less in dividends than they previously were.', 'Also, it points to difficulties the broader marijuana industry faces with oversupply and regulatory hurdles. With a dividend yield of 8% outstripping the yield of adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) it may be difficult to support the payout at current rates.\xa0So, Innovative Industrial Properties is still a good business to own, just don’t buy it for its dividend.', 'Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com', 'Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) faces many of the same issues as the other two companies on the list. The dividend is a burden that is becoming increasingly difficult to support at existing levels and may be cut to help free up cash.', 'Best Buy sales and profits are falling. With the housing market in turmoil, the retailer is pressured on important segment sales including appliances, which account for 14% of revenue. Appliance revenue was down 15% in the third quarter.', 'Also, when it reports full-year earnings later this month, they’ll likely be down again even if they beat Wall Street estimates. Yet, the retailer keeps increasing its dividend. Over the past five years, the payout is up an average 15% a year while over the last 10 years its 18% higher. With FCF rapidly evaporating, supporting such high rates of growth becomes more difficult.', 'Additionally, it’s only going to get harder going forward. Best Buy closed 24 stores in the first nine months of 2023 and 100 over the past five years. Further, the retailer anticipates closing 15 to 20 stores a year for the foreseeable future. With fewer stores come lower sales and that may make paying for a dividend yielding 5% a year difficult. The stock is up 20% from recent lows, but that doesn’t make it a buy for its dividend.', 'On the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The Nasdaq Composite, home to many of these stocks, is up a blazing 34% in 12 months, while the more diverse S&P 500 has gained 23%.', ""Yet the opportunity for generating huge returns with these stocks is even larger over the long term. That's because gains can compound over many years -- assuming a company can boost its sales footprint even as it steadily increases its earnings power."", ""Let's look at two stellar companies that seem primed to achieve this lucrative goal."", ""Forever is a long time to consider holding a stock. On the other hand, McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) has been a dominant business for a long time. The fast-food giant's popular menu items, from the Big Mac to the relatively new McChicken platform, have kept consumers coming back for decades."", ""Mickey D's has had no trouble converting the popularity of those sandwiches into sales growth and rising profit margins. Comparable-store sales in 2023 increased 9% and operating income jumped 16% after adjusting for currency exchange rate swings. The company has a good shot at moving its already industry-leading profit margin toward 50% of sales in 2024 and beyond."", ""It hasn't all been good news for McDonald's in recent quarters, of course. Customer traffic dipped into negative territory in late 2023 as shoppers became more cautious in response to rising prices. Investors will want to watch that metric this year for a better balance between higher average spending and increased guest counts."", ""In the meantime, consider taking advantage of short-term pessimism on Wall Street to pick up a cheaper stock. McDonald's is valued at 8 times sales today, down from more than 9 times sales at several other points in the past year. That's a tasty discount for a blue chip giant like McDonald's."", ""Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ: LULU) has all the ingredients that investors prize when they're searching for stellar growth stocks. The sports apparel specialist is winning market share in a huge industry while pushing into new markets, for one. Sales last quarter were up 19% compared to Nike's flat result. Lululemon achieved some of its best growth in areas outside of its core North American division and in new demographics like men's and kids' wear."", 'The chain is boosting sales via its online platform and with help from the launch of several new locations. Shoppers are increasingly frequenting existing stores, too, with comparable-store sales up 14% in the Q3 period (running through late October).', ""The best reason to like this growth stock might be Lululemon's opportunity to extend its profit margin lead over the competition in the next few years. Gross profit margin jumped to 58% of sales this past quarter even while many consumers were looking to save cash by scaling back on spending."", 'Nike, in contrast, converts less than 45% of sales into gross profit. The footwear and apparel giant recently lowered expectations for its 2024 operating trends while Lululemon boosted its outlook.', '""We are pleased with our performance during the holiday season,"" CFO Meghan Frank said in a mid-quarter update.', 'The stock is still valued at a premium, even though shares have come down from their late-2023 highs. But growth stock investors can minimize the impact of that elevated price by extending their holding period into years and -- ideally -- decades.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Lululemon Athletica right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Lululemon Athletica, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Lululemon Athletica wasn’t one of them.

Some even offered unexpected twists to their strategies."", 'The overarching story from food companies centered on a return to normal. After a year of Ozempic fears settling in, a pullback in consumer spending amid higher prices, and a few lingering post-COVID supply chain issues, food execs were eager to move the narrative forward.', 'Barring any further disruptions in 2024, one common theme from food companies was staying on track, Mizuho Securities managing director John Baumgartner told Yahoo Finance. ""This is the first year now in probably three or four where you\'re sort of operating in normalized conditions. ... So I think [they have] a lot of hope that [they\'re] going to be in a stable environment.""', 'With the conference set to run through Friday, here are some other trends Yahoo Finance noticed on the ground.', ""Food execs are focused on volume recovery, as Americans have scaled back how much they're buying because of high prices."", 'Leaders at General Mills (GIS) and Conagra were ""hesitant to comment on whether fiscal 2025 (beginning in June) could be a return to growth in line with long-term targets,"" Evercore ISI analyst David Palmer wrote in a note to clients from the event.', 'Hershey and Mondelēz (MDLZ) called out ""price pack architecture,"" which uses different sizes and price points, as a potential growth lever. ""We\'ve always capitalized on having different price points, different pack sizes, so that there\'s accessibility for everyone,"" Hershey CEO Michele Buck said to the crowd.', 'Meanwhile, WK Kellogg Co is taking a different approach by providing value through nutrition, an idea that CEO Gary Pilnick believes will stick around.', '“We go through different business cycles, we go through different fads, different nutrition demands,"" Pilnick said. ""There\'s something in [each of those trends] for cereal.""', ""In the fourth quarter, WK Kellogg's revenue decreased by 2.7%, reflecting a 10% volume decline offset by price increases."", 'Pilnick explained that affordable protein sources open up a new frontier for the cereal maker, which spun off from Kellogg’s snack business last year.

WK Kellogg's Pilnick said the company saw success bringing back customers with strawberry Frosted Flakes last year and the return of chocolate Frosted Flakes."", 'Meanwhile, J.M. Smucker (SJM) said it\'s adding raspberry Uncrustables to its lineup in September 2024 as it aims to deliver $800 million in net sales for its Uncrustables brand this fiscal year.

""Over 70% of peanut butter buyers are not purchasing a chocolate-flavor spread today, and we anticipate this innovation will be highly incremental to the brand,"" J.M. Smucker CEO Mark Smucker said.', 'Packaging innovation offers another opportunity. PepsiCo chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta said the company has invested in updating its packaging for “portion control” and “portability” as customers snack more throughout the day.', '“We want to make sure that consumers can find us in many more occasions,” he said. Pepsi is also leaning into powders and tablets, “giving consumers the opportunity to find Gatorade or to use Gatorade in a much different way.”', 'Food giants are also reengaging consumers through marketing campaigns with new partners.', ""Hershey, for example, excited the CAGNY conference crowd by bringing in NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal to announce a partnership to “win” in the gummy segment, the fastest-growing sweets segment. Conagra Brands, meanwhile, shared that Dolly Parton's baking line is expanding into frozen shelves."", ""Companies are looking for partnerships beyond grocery store shelves too. They're eager to tap into the market for dining away from home, which has seen prices continue to grow."", ""For instance, did you know McCormick (MKC) launched a limited-time offering with McDonald's (MCD) in February for the McSpicy sandwich in the UK with Frank's RedHot sauce? Or that it teamed up with Wendy's (WEN) to launch a breakfast burrito served with Cholula hot sauce?"", ""“We're excited to continue to leverage our brands and our hot and spicy flavors to further penetrate menus and add the heat in away-from-home channels,” McCormick CFO Michael Smith said."", ""While no major announcements were made, many companies teased that they're open to dealmaking but are waiting for the right company to come along."", 'WK Kellogg\'s Pilnick said potential targets ""would likely be [in the] center of the food business where our brands would resonate because you\'d get cost synergies."" However, he noted that WK Kellogg is not focused on M&A right now.', 'Mondelēz CEO Dirk Van de Put gave investors insight into its M&A process. The company begins by building relationships with about 30 to 40 companies, most of which are family-owned, making gaining trust on both sides crucial.', '""We can\'t forecast the timetable, but what I can say is that the pipeline is active,"" Van de Put said. Deals are getting “more expensive because there\'s more interest,"" he added. ""We want to stay very disciplined.""', 'However, the next major food deal may not be a traditional acquisition.', 'Mizuho\'s Baumgartner told Yahoo Finance that investors could see deals similar to Walmart\'s acquisition of Vizio, in which ""food staples companies [acquire] differentiated tech companies"" to gain a deeper understanding of consumers.', '—', 'Brooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

If you would like to skip our detailed analysis of the US travel industry, you can directly go to the 5 Best Family Vacations on a Budget for $5000.\xa0', ""According to the World Travel & Tourism Council, the US has been one of the countries leading the rebound of the tourism industry in a post-pandemic era. As per WTTC’s report, the US travel and tourism sector contributed $2 trillion to the country's GDP in 2022, showcasing a 16.9% increase. 2.7 million more jobs were created compared to the previous year, which shows this sector's high employment potential. Things were looking up at the end of 2022, but that trend didn’t carry forward into the year 2023."", 'According to the US Travel Association, the country had only reached 84% of 2019 visitation levels by December 2023, with a gap of 16% still needing to be overcome. In addition, a report commissioned by US Travel and conducted by Euromonitor revealed further insights into how the US compared to other top travel destinations worldwide. Among 18 countries, the US ranked second to last, with an overall score of 47/100.\xa0In the report’s findings, the US ranked last in terms of visa wait times as well as the strength of national leadership and tourism strategies. US visa interview wait times can go up to 400 days in many top markets, making the US an unreliable place to travel to. The issue of national leadership occurred because the US doesn’t boast many specific national-level strategies for increasing inbound visitation, nor does it have a minister dedicated to tourism or travel. ', 'The report also expanded on visitation levels, a metric in which the US fell to the third spot. In 2023, the country received 67 million visitors, whereas 79 million people visited in 2019. The country also received poor rankings in security and facilitation upon arrival, mainly due to lengthy wait times at the airport. Only 36% of the airports in the US utilize biometric entry and exit systems, the lack of which brings inefficiency to onboarding and off-boarding processes. One of the metrics in which the US performed extraordinarily well was global connectivity, as the country ranked at the top due to being a major hub for global connecting flights. The US also received one of the top rankings in the travel promotion category, which the Travel Association credited to Brand USA, a venture of public-private partnership meant to market the US travel industry.', ""While some of the metrics do warrant praise for the US tourism industry, others painted a dire picture of its current state. On January 11, 2024, the US Travel Association revealed these findings as one of the critical reasons behind creating a new Commission for Seamless and Secure Travel. The Commission will be led by Kevin McAleenan, the former Acting Secretary of Homeland Security. It will include other former members of the government as well as experts from the private sector. The Commission's primary goal is to suggest policy recommendations that can foster tourism growth within the US, solving the issues pointed out in the Euromonitor report. \xa0You can also take a look at 16 Best Places to Buy a Vacation Home in 2024.\xa0"", 'This lack of competitive growth, paired with the rising inflation within the US, has also impacted other tourism-related companies. Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB), a leading short-term rental company, faced significant shifts in the year 2023. According to a Bloomberg report, published on August 10, 2023, available revenue per room in areas of Orlando and California dropped by 6.4% and 17%, respectively, in the first half of 2023. This led to a surge in online panic, with people questioning whether Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB) is on its way to dying out. However, things are not that dire. On February 13, Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB) reported a positive surprise in its revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023. The company reported a revenue of $2.22 billion and outperformed market expectations by $53.47 million.', 'On February 13, Reuters reported that the Consumer Price Index rose by 0.3% in January, whereas the year-on-year increase was 3.1%. As the rates of rent and other commodities increase, consumers flock towards cheaper alternatives in every segment of life, including travel and tourism. Families are searching for the best vacations on a budget, and websites such as Tripadvisor, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP) can provide valuable information in this scenario.', 'Not only does the website provide useful information regarding tourist spots in every country around the world, it is also introducing new features to enhance customer experience. On February 21, Tableo, a restaurant reservation system, announced its partnership with Tripadvisor, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP). Using the Tableo-integrated version of Tripadvisor, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP), travelers can easily reserve seats at any restaurant they want, affordable or otherwise. This partnership will also benefit the restaurants signed up with Tableo, as they will be able to access the reviews left on Tripadvisor, Inc.

After consulting over 10 online travel expert sources, we generated a list of budget vacation places that appeared in at least 50% of our sources. To further shortlist fifteen places, and rank them in order from most expensive to least, we utilized average rates for flights and night stays. We considered these two metrics because they tend to take up the highest chunk of any vacation’s budget, whereas food, shopping, and entertainment costs vary depending on the trip you wish to take. Each place listed in this article has a range of dining options and activities, within every price budget.\xa0', 'Please note that the flight rate is per person, whereas the accommodation rate is for one room that can host two adults and two kids. For both these rates, Kayak was consulted. Flight fares are round-trip, with the starting location being Newark, New Jersey. For accommodation in particular, only 3-star+ lodgings were considered, with a minimum average rating of above 6. Also, note that both rates are from the time this article was written. These numbers are only meant to present a moderate idea of how affordable a place is. Depending on the tourist influx, each place on this list will be cheapest at a different time of the year.\xa0', 'Going by this methodology, here is our list of the 15 best family vacations for a budget lower than $5,000.', 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

Flight fares will be your most considerable expense for this holiday because accommodations and local dining spots cost much less than they do in the United States.

Most hiking trails are easily accessible from nearby accommodations and have no entrance fee. The Hot Springs National Park itself is free, so families can visit the park and its museum to enjoy both nature and history for free. Instead of staying in pricier hotels, families can also buy spots at the campsites, starting at around $34.\xa0', 'Flight Fare: $418', 'Accommodation: $111', 'Total: $529', 'San Diego has warm temperatures around the year, so families have the benefit of visiting off-season in order to find more affordable rates. The peak tourist season is from June to August, so expect the hotel rates to be highest during these months. San Diego has over 60 beaches, many of which have smaller waves, perfect for children’s surfing. In addition to enjoying the beaches, families can also do several adventurous things in the city, such as visiting museums or zoos.\xa0', 'Flight Fare: $360', 'Accommodation: $99', 'Total: $459', 'Gatlinburg is one of the best budget family vacations to visit nature, as it provides affordable access to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The park provides family activities like wildlife viewing, biking, and hiking, all of which can be enjoyed together by the whole family. The Gatlinburg Trolley will take you through town for free, enabling you to save further money during your budget vacation.\xa0', 'Flight Fare: $364', 'Accommodation: $79', 'Total: $443', 'April is one of the best months to visit St. Louis because the weather is moderate, and children are usually on spring break. Sites like the Missouri History Museum, St. Louis Zoo, the Science Center, and the Ulysses S. Grant National Historic Site can be visited for free.

There might be no other industry where investors can find these types of businesses as readily as in the banking industry. That's because banks are fundamental to the functioning of an economy, facilitating the movement of capital. Their essential services will always be needed."", ""Bank of America's business has hit a bit of a rough patch due to macroeconomic uncertainty and higher interest rates.

Moreover, Bank of America provides largely commoditized products and services. This makes me not want to own its shares."", ""On the other hand, I am a fan of American Express. While it can be impacted by the swings of the broader economy due to its lending operations, the fact that it also operates a lucrative payments network intrigues me.

These figures underscore MLM's robust market position and its ability to capitalize on favorable market conditions. With a comprehensive benefits package and a focus on employee development, MLM demonstrates a commitment to maintaining a skilled and motivated workforce, which is integral to its continued success. This SWOT analysis aims to provide investors with a detailed examination of MLM's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as derived from the latest SEC filings."", ""Financial Robustness: MLM's financial performance in 2023 was exceptional, with record revenues and gross profit. The company's revenue growth was 10% year-over-year, and its gross profit surged by 42.1%, indicating a strong market position and effective cost management.

The company acknowledges potential difficulties in assimilating new employees, business systems, and technologies, which could lead to performance shortfalls and distract management attention from core operations."", ""Infrastructure Initiatives: MLM stands to benefit from various 2023 ballot initiatives aimed at funding infrastructure growth and development. The company's aggregates and cement products are essential for public-sector construction projects, and increased infrastructure spending could lead to higher demand for MLM's offerings."", ""Sustainable Building Solutions: There is a growing demand for sustainable construction practices, and MLM's products, such as magnesium hydroxide used to increase fuel efficiency, position the company favorably in this trend. The push for green construction projects could drive demand for MLM's cement and concrete business, aligning with the company's focus on sustainable and efficient building solutions."", ""Construction Industry Cyclicality: MLM's business is heavily dependent on the cyclical nature of the construction industry. Economic and political uncertainties can lead to reduced credit availability for construction projects, delays, or cancellations, which could adversely affect demand for MLM's products."", ""Environmental and Regulatory Risks: MLM's operations are subject to stringent environmental, health, and safety regulations.

I will now turn the call over to Doug Pferdehirt, TechnipFMC's Chair and Chief Executive Officer."", 'Doug Pferdehirt: Thank you, Matt. Good morning, and good afternoon. Thank you for participating in our fourth quarter earnings call. I am proud to report our strong quarterly and full year results which really speak to the growth and operational momentum we are achieving. Total company inbound for the year grew to $11 billion. This included subsea orders of $9.7 billion, which was an increase of 45% versus the prior year and a book-to-bill of 1.5. These strong results benefited from a record level of iEPCI awards in the period. Total company revenue for the year grew 17% to $7.8 billion. Adjusted EBITDA improved to $939 million when excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This was an increase of 30% percent when compared to the prior year.', ""We generated free cash flow of $468 million for the year and we returned nearly $250 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. While these are solid improvements, I am particularly pleased with the quality of the inbound received in 2023 with direct awards iEPCI and subsea services together exceeding 70% of subsea inbound. We're also seeing tangible improvements in Surface Technologies. This has resulted in improved financial performance, higher cash generation and greater consistency in delivering on our annual commitments. Anyway, you look at it 2023 was a period of strong growth for our company and we see continued strength ahead, driven by the resiliency and durability of this cycle. The demand for energy will continue to grow."", ""A more than a decade unconventional resources in North America have provided a significant portion of the world's hydrocarbon globe. The growth from the region will be more limited in the years ahead driven by Capital Frameworks that reward higher economic returns and increased shareholder distributions. This means that the incremental production needed to support global growth will come primarily from international markets driven by the Middle East and offshore. Looking ahead, the market for conventional energy resources will evolve differently than what we have experienced in the past, driven by three major trends, a shift in capital flows, an increased role for new technologies and an expanded role for subsea services, all of which will allow TechnipFMC to leverage the full capabilities of our integrated solutions, differentiated technologies, and the industry's most comprehensive subsea service capabilities."", 'Looking more closely at these major trends, let’s start with the shift in capital flows. We expect to see continued strength in spending both in land and offshore markets. However, the dynamics will differ across the major markets as capital flows are typically a function of returns and access. In North America, the industry has access to resources, but economic returns will continue to be challenged outside the most prolific basins. We believe this will result in more modest growth in the region. Opportunities in the Middle East benefit from strong economic returns that will drive continued growth. That said, the number of operators that have access to these attractive resources is far more limited, which brings us to the offshore markets.', 'Here we believe much improved economic returns and broad operator access to deep water resources will attract a growing share of global capital flows. And with more than 90% of our total revenue generated outside the North America land market, FTI stands out as the pure-play equity to address this opportunity. While the strength of these trends is partly reflected in our current backlog and revenue guidance, we have high confidence in the durability of the market over the intermediate term. In 2024, we remain on track to meet our prior guidance for subsea inbound, with current year order expectations approaching $10 billion. Today, we are also increasing our expectations for subsea inbound over the three-year period ending 2025 to reach $30 billion, a 20% increase versus our prior view.', 'Looking beyond capital flows, we expected technology will also play a bigger role in spending behavior. Here TechnipFMC is focused on developing technologies for both conventional and new energies to drive market expansion. More specifically, we are using technology to drive further innovation in the offshore market creating new growth opportunities. A clear example of innovation is the Mero 3 HISEP contract, which we were awarded just last month. The significance of this project for the subsea industry cannot be overstated. It would be the first to use subsea processing to capture CO2 directly from the well stream for injection back into the reservoir. Importantly, this will all take place on the sea floor. In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emission intensity, HISEP technologies will increase production capacity by debottlenecking the gas processing plant that currently resides on the FPSO.', 'By moving the gas processing entirely to the seafloor, future FPSO topside designs can be further simplified driving significant improvement in project economics. HISEP is a major milestone for the subsea industry and for TechnipFMC. This project plays to our strengths. HISEP will allow us to demonstrate how technology innovation, project integration and partner collaboration enable our meaningful participation in the energy transition, while remaining aligned with our strategic priorities. It is the first iEPCI project ever awarded by Petrobras. And it builds upon Our strong order momentum starting the year with an iEPCI award that exceeded $1 billion. And finally, the third major trend driving subsea market growth opportunities can be found in services.', 'Today, subsea fields hosts more than 7,000 subsea trees and associated infrastructure, including manifolds, control systems, umbilicals and flexible pipe. This list is certainly not inclusive of all major components of a subsea production system. However, it does highlight the size and scale of the industry’s large and more importantly growing installed base. TechnipFMC’s global services organization plays a critical role throughout the entire life of the field, from system installation to maintenance intervention and production optimization and all the way through life of field. Our 2023 results clearly demonstrate that our strategy to enhance this resilient, growing, and high-return business is delivering real value with our services revenue having achieved over $1.5 billion for the year.', 'In summary, we close out a solid year having delivered many notable achievements. Subsea inbound orders increased 45% versus the prior year and included a new record for iEPCI awards. This growth in orders also drove a 50% increase in subsea backlog to over $12 billion with high-quality inbound supported with further improvement in our financial returns. And our growth in full-year operational results reflect strong momentum that continues into 2024. We have entered an unprecedented time for the development of conventional energy resources, driven by three major trends, a shift in capital flows, which we believe will largely be directed to the offshore and Middle East markets, an increased role for new technologies as shown by the MERO 3 HISEP award, and an expanded role for subsea services driven by the needs of growing and aging infrastructure.', 'Importantly, these trends underpin the 20% increase in our expectation for subsea inbound over the three-year period ending 2025, which had $30 billion will provide additional growth in backlog and further expand the execution of our project portfolio through the end of the decade. I will now turn the call over to Alf.', 'Alf Melin: Thanks, Doug. Inbound in the quarter was $1.5 billion, driven by $1.3 billion of subsea orders. Revenue in the quarter totaled $2.1 billion. EBITDA was $245 million, when excluding foreign exchange loss of $26 million and restructuring impairment and other charges totaling $10 million. Turning to segment results, Subsea revenue of $1.7 billion increased modestly versus the third quarter. The increase in revenue was due to higher productivity in the Gulf of Mexico, Asia Pacific and Africa, driven in part by accelerated conversion of several projects from backlog. The increased activity was largely offset by seasonal factors that impacted vessel utilization. Revenue for Subsea Services modestly increased due to strength in asset maintenance and ROE services in Norway, in the Gulf of Mexico.', 'Services revenue was also less impacted in the quarter by typical offshore seasonality, particularly in the North Sea. Adjusted EBITDA was $225 million, with a margin of 13.1%, down 200 basis points from the third quarter due to lower vessel-based activity and a mix of projects executed from backlog in the period. For the full year, subsea revenue grew 18% percent versus the prior year with adjusted EBITDA margin up 180 basis points to 13.3%. In Surface Technologies revenue was $357 million in the quarter, an increase of 2% sequentially. The increase in revenue was driven by higher activity in international and North America markets, both benefiting from higher wellhead equipment sales. Adjusted EBITDA was $52 million, a 5% sequential increase benefiting from increased contribution from international services and higher wellhead sales.', 'Adjusted EBITDA margin was 14.7%, up 30 basis points versus the third quarter. For the full year, Surface Technologies revenue was up 12% versus the prior year with adjusted EBITDA margin up 230 basis points to 13.6%. Turning to corporate and other items in the quarter. Corporate expense was $33 million, when excluding $5 million of charges. Net interest expense was $13 million and benefited from increased interest income in the period, driven in part by strong cash generation. Tax expense was $54 million. And lastly, foreign exchange loss was $26 million, the majority of which was related to the significant devaluation of the Argentine peso. Cash flow from operating activities was $701 million. Capital expenditures were $72 million. This resulted in free cash flow of $630 million in the quarter.', 'Free cash flow for the full year was $468 million, above the high end of our guidance range. When excluding impact of foreign exchange, we converted 50% of adjusted EBITDA to free cash flow, achieving the cash conversion rates we had previously targeted for 2025. Total shareholder distributions where $77 million in the quarter and $249 million for the full year. We ended the period with cash and cash equivalents on $952 million. Net debt declined more than $500 million to $116 million. In November, we announced an agreement to sell our Measurement Solutions business for $205 million in cash. We now expect to conclude the transaction by the end of the first quarter subject to customary closing conditions. Moving to our financial outlook, we have provided detailed guidance for the current fiscal year in our earnings release.', 'I won’t speak to all the details, but will provide some context for certain items for the full year and first quarter. I will begin with Subsea. At the midpoint of our full-year guidance range, we anticipate revenue of $7.4 billion with an EBITDA margin of 16%. This represents a 270 basis point margin improvement from the prior year. Our outlook also anticipates contingent growth in Subsea Services revenue to approximately $1.65 billion, achieving this level, one year ahead of our previous target. For the first quarter, we anticipate Subsea revenue to decline low-to-mid single-digits due to more typical seasonal activity patterns, and EBITDA margin to be in line with fourth quarter results. Turning to Surface Technologies, at the midpoint of our full-year guidance range, we anticipate revenue of approximately $1.275 billion with an EBITDA margin of 14%.', 'This guidance assumes we complete the sale of our Measurement Solutions business by the end of the first quarter. When excluding the impact of this sale, as well as the exit of certain geographies and portfolio rationalization in the Americas, our Surface Technologies revenue is anticipated to grow approximately 5% year-over-year. For the first quarter, we anticipate revenue to decline approximately 10%, when compared to fourth quarter results with an EBITDA margin of approximately 13%. We anticipate full year corporate expense of $115 million to $125 million. In 2023, the company initiated an ERP system upgrade. Our corporate expense now includes approximately $10 million in annual costs related to the implementation of the upgraded system.', 'We expect to incur a similar cost each year until completion of the project in 2027. We anticipate capital expenditures of $275 million, which is just over 3% of revenue at the midpoint of our guidance range. Finally, we are guiding free cash flow for the full year to a range of $350 million to 500 million. This includes approximately $170 million for the remaining payments related to the resolution of all outstanding matters with the PNF. Excluding these payments the midpoint of our free cash flow guidance would approximate $600 million. In closing when our guidance items are taken at the midpoint of the range, we anticipate total company EBITDA of $1.25 billion for the full year. This represents EBITDA growth of 33% percent versus the prior year, when excluding foreign exchange.', 'I also want to stress that we expect to achieve this significant growth, despite the impact of the strategic actions taken in Surface Technologies and the incremental spend related to the ERP system upgrade. This is also first second consecutive year for free cash flow conversion of nearly 50% when excluding the settlement payments. And we expect this to drive growth in shareholder distribution of at least 35% and a further reduction in net debt.

In 2024, we remain on track to meet our prior guidance for subsea inbound [orders]. With current year order expectations approaching $10 billion today, we are also increasing our expectations for subsea inbound [orders] over the three years ending 2025 to reach $30 billion, a 20% increase versus our prior view,” Pferdehirt said.', 'That first order for 2024, he noted, came from Petrobras, which in January awarded TechnipFMC an integrated engineering, procurement, construction and installation (iEPCI) contract valued at more than $1 billion for subsea high-pressure separation and reinjection of CO2 at the deepwater Mero 3 field offshore Brazil.', 'While TechnipFMC has offered subsea processing and boosting solutions, the Mero 3 High Pressure Separation (HISEP) project is a “completely different” application of the technology, he said.', '“Greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity, CCS (carbon capture and storage) opens up a completely different dynamic in terms of the thinking around sanctioning a project,” he said.', 'Mero 3 “is a CCS project. This is about reducing greenhouse gas intensity. This is about separating the CO2 on the seafloor and re-injecting it into the subsurface. It never sees the atmosphere. It is at the bottom of the ocean on the seafloor in a closed loop system where we can separate out the CO2 and again re-inject CO2, hence delivering a much lower greenhouse gas intensity for the project,” he said.', 'This added dimension is one reason he believes the Mero 3 HISEP project opens “almost” a new market.', 'Pferdehirt said HISEP technology might appeal to offshore operators due to reduced FPSO complexity and construction costs of the gas processing plant when placed subsea, as well as its role in reducing GHG intensity.', 'Placing a gas processing unit on the seabed rather than on an FPSO reduces the complexity of FPSO topsides.', '“There’s obviously more real estate on the seafloor. We can do things, if you will, horizontally, whereas if you are on a ship, you are pretty much constrained to doing things vertically. Any sort of vertical construction costs more than horizontal construction,” he said.', 'While TechnipFMC has worked with Petrobras since 2016 on the technology, the plan is to design one and build many, he added.', 'TechnipFMC’s integrated contract offerings can trim a year or more off project timelines, Pferdehirt said, and he expects that to continue to improve over time.', 'He compared the expected continuous innovation curve for subsea offerings to the improvements in fracking unconventional wells.', ""“Back in the day when I was fracking, it was single stage, single well and at most you did two a day because you had to rig down to move to the next well,” he said, noting that eventually evolved into simul-fracking and trimul-fracking. “We saw that productivity curve, which was dramatic and very impressive, what was able to be accomplished in the unconventionals, think about it. And subsea is going to be no different. It’s just we're in the very early stages of it.”"", ""He said TechnipFMC is delivering projects so much faster “than anyone else can do it because they’re doing it the old-fashioned way,” which is bespoke. “We're not doing bespoke anymore. We’re doing configure to order versus engineer to order.”"", 'As the industry ventures further into the Lower Tertiary in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM), operators will need equipment rated for higher pressures. On Feb. 19, Shell awarded TechnipFMC an iEPCI contract valued between $250 million and $500 million for subsea production systems, umbilicals, risers and flowlines rated up to 20,000 psi.', '“Lower Tertiary Gulf of Mexico high pressure clearly is starting to move forward,” he said.', 'While Sparta is not TechnipFMC’s first 20K project—in 2019 it won a contract for LLOG’s Shenandoah project in the GoM—it is the company’s first 20K iEPCI contract, he said. And more awards are possible.', ""“Chevron has assets. Shell has assets. BP has assets. Beacon, LLOG, both have assets,” he said, adding that most of these assets have a “high probability” of moving forward. “We don't speak to it as a new frontier, but it certainly is a new horizon within an existing frontier.”"", 'Pferdehirt also said electrification of subsea systems will allow the industry to work in ever deeper waters.', '“Deeper and electrified are actually complementary,” he said.', 'The response time for hydraulic actuation systems is not fast enough in extremely deep waters, he said.', '“Electrification will enable deeper, but there are also other aspects to going deeper, particularly when you think about things like flexible pipe design. We have the only flexible pipe that will be able to work at the depths that these emerging basins are being developed,” he said.', 'For the fourth quarter of 2023, TechnipFMC reported net income of $53 million on revenue of $2 billion, compared to third-quarter 2023 net income of $90 million on revenue of $2.1 billion and fourth-quarter 2022 net loss of $26.7 million on revenue of $1.7 billion.', 'For 2023, the company reported net income of $56 million on revenue of $7.8 billion, compared to net loss of $61.9 million on revenue of $6.7 billion in 2022.']"

This digital push can also streamline operations and improve inventory management."", ""Market Penetration: With plans to open approximately 80 new Tractor Supply and 10 to 15 new Petsense by Tractor Supply stores in fiscal 2024, the company is poised for further market penetration. This expansion strategy, coupled with the company's proven method for selecting store sites, can lead to increased market share and revenue growth."", ""Weather and Climate Risks: Tractor Supply Co's business is highly seasonal and sensitive to weather patterns. Unseasonal weather can disrupt sales and supply chains, while extreme weather events can lead to store closures and inventory damage. The long-term impacts of climate change pose additional risks to the company's operations and cost structures."", ""Economic Fluctuations: Economic downturns can significantly impact consumer spending, particularly in the discretionary segments that Tractor Supply Co serves. The company's performance is tied to the financial health of its core customer base, making it susceptible to broader economic trends and consumer confidence levels."", ""In conclusion, Tractor Supply Co (NASDAQ:TSCO) exhibits a strong market presence and financial stability, underpinned by its brand recognition and diversified product offerings. However, the company must address supply chain complexities and competitive pressures to sustain its growth trajectory. Opportunities for expansion through digital initiatives and market penetration are promising, yet they are tempered by the threats of adverse weather conditions and economic uncertainty. Tractor Supply Co's strategic focus on customer experience and operational excellence positions it well to navigate these challenges and capitalize on its strengths in the evolving rural lifestyle retail landscape."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Please go ahead.', 'Daniel Dennis Guffey', ""Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining Coterra Energy's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings and 2024 Outlook Conference Call. Today's prepared remarks will include an overview from Tom Jorden, Chairman, CEO and President; Shane Young, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Blake Sirgo, Senior Vice President of Operations.Following our prepared remarks, we will take your questions during our Q&A session. As a reminder, on today's call, we will make forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Additionally, some of our comments will reference non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures were provided in our earnings release and updated investor presentation, both of which can be found on our website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom."", 'Thomas E. Jorden', 'Thank you, Dan, and welcome to all of you who are joining us on the call. Coterra had an excellent fourth quarter as shown by the results that we released last night. Shane will walk you through the specifics here, which include coming in above the high end of our guidance on oil, natural gas and BOE or barrels of oil equivalent and below our capital guide.For full year 2023, we finished the year with 5% year-over-year growth in BOE and 10% year-over-year growth in oil volumes while hitting the midpoint of our capital guide.More importantly, we generated excellent returns. We also made great progress on emissions reduction and continue to push the envelope on our environmental initiatives.As we look ahead to 2024, total capital is projected to be between $1.75 billion and $1.95 billion. Given the outlook for commodity prices and commensurate revenue, we think that this is a prudent level of investment as it invests approximately 60% of our projected cash flow. We will grow our investments in the Permian and Anadarko basins and retrench in the Marcellus. We are reducing our Marcellus investments by over $400 million in 2024 compared to 2023. Mark Twain said that a man learned something by carrying a cat by the tail that he can learn in no other way. Through the commodity cycles, we have learned that, although down swings typically do not last long, they also do not come pre-labeled with how long they will last. We have learned to be disciplined and patient. Experience tells us that our focus should always be on returns and never on production or activity. In this case, that means throttling back on our Marcellus program. We remain highly optimistic on the 12- to 18-month outlook for the gas macro. The impact of new LNG export capacity coming online at the end of 2024 and early 2025 coupled with the possibility of cold weather provides reasonable hope for significant price recovery in natural gas. However, experience tells us that although we will underwrite our hopes with the future strip price, we should never underwrite our capital program with it. We will be patient and watch for recovery in the gas macro. Missing a few months of the recovery is much better than fully participating in the downside.We project that the slowdown in the Marcellus will result in our natural gas volume shrinking 6% in the Marcellus in 2024. If we see signs of recovery in natural gas, our 2024 capital range includes a contingency plan to accelerate our Marcellus program in the latter half of the year, which would reposition us for significant growth in our gas volumes in 2025 and 2026. We will watch and be ready to act. In the meantime, we will pivot to our deep inventory in the Anadarko and Permian where our returns are excellent. We have a tremendous program ahead of us in 2024, and we are excited to be increasing activity in both the Permian and Anadarko. All 3 business units, however, are poised and ready for out-year acceleration should conditions warrant. This ability to redirect and reposition activity around premier assets is one of the differentiating strengths of Coterra. We also provided an update on our 3-year outlook. Our new 2024 to 2026 outlook has Coterra with an average annual CapEx of $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion. Which is expected to generate annual growth in the low single digits for BOE and 5% plus for oil growth. This plan leverages our deep, high-quality inventory, demonstrates improving capital efficiency and clearly displays the confidence we have in our ability to continue a cadence of operational excellence. This is an achievable outlook under current conditions. As always, we continuously adjust our plans with changing conditions. As we have previously said, planning at Coterra is a guided missile not a rocket fire.In closing, I wanted to acknowledge our remarkable field organization. They set the pace for operational excellence. They work in hostile environments with dedication, perseverance and an unwavering commitment to safety. They serve as an example to all of us. The Coterra brand stands for operational excellence, leading-edge technology and innovation, best-in-class development of outstanding assets and the ability to adapt nimbly to changing market conditions. We want to be known for a pristine balance sheet, investment discipline and rigorous economic decision analysis. We are not perfect. However, having a great organization, great assets and a great balance sheet allows us to learn from our mistakes, make continuous progress and always push ourselves farther and harder. With that, I will turn the call over to Shane.', 'Shannon E. Young', ""So thank you, Tom. And thank you, everyone, for joining us on today's call. This morning, I'll focus on 4 areas: First, I will discuss highlights for our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. Then, I will provide production and capital guidance for the first quarter and full year 2024. Next, I will provide a new and updated 3-year production and capital outlook for 2024 through 2026. Finally, I'll discuss our shareholder return program and our debt maturity later this year. Turning to our strong performance during the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter total production averaged 697 MBOE per day, with oil averaging 104.7 MBO per day and natural gas averaging 2.97 Bcf (sic) [2.87] per day. All production streams came in above the high end of guidance, driven by well performance and acceleration of TIL timing during the quarter. Specifically, turn-in lines during the quarter totaled 40 net wells, including 28 in the Permian, near the high end of guidance, and 12 in the Marcellus, slightly above the midpoint of guidance. During the fourth quarter, free hedge revenues were approximately $1.5 billion, of which 61% were generated by oil and NGL sales. In the quarter, we reported net income of $416 million or $0.55 per share and adjusted net income of $387 million or $0.52 per share. Total cash costs during the quarter, including LOE, workover, transportation, production taxes and G&A totaled $8.41 per BOE, near the midpoint of our annual guidance range of $7.30 to $9.40 per BOE. Cash hedge gains during the quarter totaled $46 million. Incurred capital expenditures in the fourth quarter totaled $457 million, just below the low end of our guidance range. Discretionary cash flow was $881 million and free cash flow was $413 million, after cash capital expenditures was $468 million. For the full year 2023, Coterra produced outstanding results. Total equivalent production exceeded the high end of our initial February guidance, coming in at 667 MBOE per day. This outperformance was driven by a combination of better-than-expected well timing and beats on expected well productivity. Oil production for the year was 96.2 MBO per day, exceeding the high end of initial guidance by over 4%. Capital costs were right at the midpoint of our guidance range, coming in at $2.1 billion as a result of relentless focus on capital by our teams in each of our business units. Cash operating cost per unit totaled $8.37 per BOE for the year, slightly below our initial guidance midpoint.Looking ahead to 2024. During the first quarter of 2024, we expect total production to average between 660 and 690 MBOE per day, oil to be between 95 and 99 MBO per day and natural gas to be between 2.85 and 2.95 Bcf per day. We anticipate first quarter oil production to have the lowest average for any quarter during 2024. Primarily as a result of TIL timing that pulled some volume forward and into the fourth quarter of 2023. Regarding investment, we expect incurred capital in the first quarter to be between $460 million and $540 million. For the full year 2024, we expect incurred capital to be between $1.75 billion and $1.95 billion or 12% lower at the midpoint than our 2023 capital spend. Our 2024 program will modestly increase capital allocation to the liquids-rich Permian and Anadarko Basins and significantly decrease capital by more than 50% in the Marcellus. We expect total production for the year to average between 635 and 675 MBOE per day and oil to be between 99 and 105 MBO per day or 6% higher at the midpoint than oil was in 2023.Natural gas is expected to be between 2.65 and 2.8 Bcf per day. Approximately 5.5% lower at the midpoint than gas production was in 2023. It is important to note that we have incorporated efficiency gains achieved in 2023 into our 2024 guidance. Reflecting on our new 3-year outlook. As we did this time last year, yesterday, we announced our new 3-year outlook for 2024 through 2026. We believe this is a robust capital-efficient plan that delivers consistent profitable growth for our shareholders. We anticipate that our project inventory can deliver 5%-plus oil volume growth over this period with 0% to 5% BOE growth by investing between $1.75 billion and $1.95 billion of capital per year. This reflects increased capital efficiency and is designed to afford Coterra the flexibility to reallocate capital between our business units as market conditions change. This outlook incorporates an appropriate level of reinvestment and delivers meaningful free cash flow to underpin shareholder returns. Moving on to shareholder returns. Last night, we announced a $0.21 per share base dividend for the fourth quarter, increasing our annual base dividend by 5% to $0.84 per share. This remains one of the highest yielding base dividends in the industry at well over 3%. Management and the Board remain committed to responsibly increasing the base dividend on an annual cadence.During 2023, despite relatively lower commodity prices and cash flow, Coterra continued to execute on its shareholder return program by repurchasing 17 million shares for $418 million at an average price of approximately $25 per share. In total, we returned 77% of free cash flow during the year or just over $1 billion. We remain committed to our strategy of returning 50% or more of our annual free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of a healthy base dividend and our share repurchase program. On to our 2024 notes. We have continued to monitor and analyze opportunities regarding our $575 million maturity coming this September. With low leverage at 0.3x, we believe we have strong access to the active refinancing markets. At the same time, we had approximately $2.5 billion of liquidity between cash and our undrawn credit facility at year-end, affording us many options with regard to our 2024 maturity.In summary, Coterra's team delivered another quarter of high-quality results, both operationally and financially. We are poised for a strong first (inaudible) of 2024, which we believe will set a solid foundation for the full year 2024 and beyond.With that, I will hand the call over to Blake to provide additional color and detail on our operations. Blake?"", 'Blake A. Sirgo', ""Thanks, Shane. This morning, I will discuss our capital expenditures and provide an operational update. Fourth quarter accrued capital expenditures totaled $457 million, coming in just below the low end of our guidance. The lower CapEx was driven by efficiency and cost gains, reduced infrastructure spend, lower-than-expected nonoperated capital and shuffling of the timing on a few projects. As noted, strong execution in the field pulled a few Q1 TILs into Q4, which contributed to the Q4 '23 production beat.Coterra finished the year at $2.104 billion of total CapEx at our midpoint of our annual guide. This quarter marks the 10th quarter in Coterra's existence, and 10 straight quarters of delivering on our oil guidance. This was accomplished thanks to our operations teams across our business units who strive for operational excellence.At Coterra, operational excellence means operating safely and with integrity while always looking for ways to accomplish more or less. We do not tolerate sacred cows, and we are always on the hunt for new ideas, even if they are not our own. As we enter 2024, we are delivering a plan that continues to do more for less.In Permian, we are planning to turn in line 75 to 90 wells in 2024, which is down 13% over 2023. These wells will have a dollar per foot of $1,075, down approximately 10% year-over-year. In the Permian, we are currently running 2 frac crews and 8 drilling rigs, which are performing at or near all-time efficiency records. Our frac efficiencies are coupled with new contracts that offer increased cost savings to Coterra as we gain in efficiency. Across our Permian footprint, we are taking advantage of our large contiguous assets to bring economies of scale to bear. This is highlighted by our Windham Row project in Culberson County, where we are prosecuting a 51-well row development across 6 drill spacing units with each well targeting the Upper Wolfcamp.By concentrating in activity at this scale, we are able to minimize rig and frac moves, co-mingle facilities and maximize time-outs. Combine this with our first grid-powered electric simulfrac, we expect to deliver these wells at 5% to 15% lower cost than our historical program.Our Permian asset is an engine of capital efficiency, and that engine continues to find a new gear. In the Marcellus, we are currently running 2 rigs and 1 frac crew with plans to go to 1 rig and lower our frac activity. Our Marcellus ops teams worked diligently in 2023 to lower our cost structure through increased frac efficiencies, improved water handling and lower facility costs. We are also pushing new limits on lateral length with 3 and 4-mile laterals now part of our program. These cost gains help us to minimize our D&C spend as we go into 2024 and throttle down our activity.Our 2024 Marcellus program remains flexible and includes multiple on-ramps and off-ramps, which will allow us to adjust to changing macro conditions if warranted.In the Anadarko, we are currently running 2 rigs and 1 frac crew. Our Anadarko team had a great year executing with improved drilling times and frac efficiencies. Our 2024 program includes 20 to 25 turn-in lines across 5 projects focused on our liquids-rich assets, which we expect will continue to yield strong returns. Consistency of execution, paired with strong well results, has made our Anadarko assets a stout competitor for capital allocation at Coterra.Our unrelenting focus on operational excellence continued to bear fruit in 2023. And we expect the team to seek out and execute incremental efficiencies in 2024.And with that, I'll turn it back to Tom."", 'Thomas E. Jorden', ""Thank you, Shane and Blake. We are pleased with our continued execution in 2023 and expect to deliver on our goals outlined in our 2024 plans. We appreciate your interest in Coterra and look forward to discussing our results and outlook.We'll now be open for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of Nitin Kumar with Mizuho Securities.', 'Nitin Kumar', ""Congrats on a strong year that really showcases the idea that was behind Coterra. I guess I want to start at just the capital allocation, you're cutting activity in the Marcellus in response to gas prices. But a lot of people think of the Anadarko Basin as a gas basin and you're allocating some incremental capital there. But could you walk us through kind of the thought process there?"", 'Thomas E. Jorden', ""Thanks, Nitin. I'll probably disappoint with my answer because it's pretty simple. I'll say upfront, I know a lot of people think of Anadarko in a lot of ways, and I'd like them to keep thinking that way because we think the Anadarko is a tremendous basin with great opportunity. One of the things that was a challenge for Anadarko team was just showing repeatability. I've talked at length about capital allocation being a function of return on capital and repeatability in addition to how much windage do you have in the price file. And our team showed great repeatability on some outstanding projects in 2023. And so the increased allocation is really a function of letting them just continue their activity level. Had we done anything other than that, we would have throttled back or pulled the plug on their continuing activity. The returns are outstanding. I'll just say that.And so we're reallocating a little under $300 million between the Permian and Anadarko. And that's just -- it was challenging because we have great returns everywhere. I'll also say that one of the things that we see in the Anadarko coming forward is we have some peers that are also moving forward with increased activity. And so we expect a larger outside operated call on our capital in the Anadarko and some of that is embedded in that allocation. So really, it's a problem that we love to have, and we're very pleased with our allocation decision."", 'Nitin Kumar', ""Great. And then, Tom, industry consolidation continues at a pretty frantic pace. As you look around the lease lines, you have new neighbors or maybe the same neighbor around you. Your thoughts on scale M&A for Coterra from here on out. You certainly have a plethora of organic opportunities, but I'd love to hear your thoughts on M&A going forward."", 'Thomas E. Jorden', 'Nitin, thank you for that. Our criteria is very simple. When we look at potential combinations, we ask ourselves, would we rather want a share of Coterra or a share of the combined reformulated company. And there are, of course, a lot of elements to that. But first and foremost, it must create value for our owners.And look, I think the Wall Street Journal should have a weekend breaking story that says, ""flash, everybody looking at everybody else in the E&P space"", because that\'s what we have. So there haven\'t been any opportunities that we really have browbeat ourselves on that have come and gone. We remain deeply curious about what consolidation could offer for Coterra owners. But the bar is very, very high. I\'ll just leave it at that.', 'Operator', 'Your next question will come from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.', 'Arun Jayaram', ""I was wondering, I'm looking at Slide 15 in your deck, where you're highlighting your expectations for well productivity in the Delaware Basin relative to peers and the results from Coterra from 2021 to '23. I was wondering if you could maybe provide some color around expectations on productivity in '24 if we could kind of compare that to what you did last year?"", 'Blake A. Sirgo', ""Yes, Arun, this is Blake. I'll take that. That's really why we kind of give that range on that slide. As we've talked about in the past, our Permian program is really a rotation throughout our assets. And that's driven by a lot of different things. The mix can vary somewhat year-to-year, but over a multiyear time frame, it's pretty consistent. And so I'd just say we'd expect '24 to fall well within that band and deliver another good year on productivity."", 'Arun Jayaram', ""And just thoughts on comparison to what you delivered in '23? Just trying to understand how you think year-over-year productivity could trend on a per foot basis?"", 'Blake A. Sirgo', ""I would say very similar. There's definitely some room for upside there with some of the allocations, but I'd expect another strong year."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America.', 'Kaleinoheaokealaula Scott Akamine', ""This is actually Kalein for Doug. The first thing I want to hit is the Marcellus, where you're adapting activity in response to price. So I guess I'm trying to understand the scenario analysis. Is the Marcellus' free cash flow breakeven on '24 strip. And assuming basis is static, at what hub price does activity begin to shift higher?"", 'Thomas E. Jorden', ""Kalei, this is Tom. We've been debating that internally. I can't give you a firm number. But I will say that we look really carefully at receive price. And I know we talk about weighted average sales price, but we really look at the price received by the next molecule, which is really a function of what would be a basis price, less our fixed cost.I would say we would really like to see a price close to or above $3, I think before it would really meet a criteria that shifts a lot of capital, but it's also a function of the oil to gas ratio. And we'd really like to see a sustained ratio that's somewhere in the neighborhood of 20:1, oil to gas. And we're really optimistic we're going to see that when the market resets with LNG exports. But -- that's kind of what we're looking for."", 'Kaleinoheaokealaula Scott Akamine', 'I appreciate that, Tom. My follow-up is on the Anadarko. I seem to remember that the geology there being quite complex. So wondering if you can expand on what the team accomplished last year to give you more confidence to reengage in the capital program.', 'Thomas E. Jorden', ""Well, geology is complex across our portfolio. And if you don't, I have to catch myself or I'll spend the rest of the call talking about geology. But what's most important is that we've tested this section, we've got a lot of calibration and we understand the stratigraphic variation, we understand the oil/gas complex ratio variation and we understand the pressure and drilling challenges. So I think we're highly calibrated.So look, complex geology is a bigger issue at the early phases of development than when you've got that calibration, and we feel really confident that we understand the geological overprint."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of David Deckelbaum with TD Cowen.', 'David Adam Deckelbaum', ""I was curious just if you could go into -- just obviously, the program this year is shifting more or, I guess, it's high grading a bit more into the Lower Marcellus. I think that in your multiyear outlook, you sort of assume that Marcellus production comes back up, I guess, about 100 million a day. And I guess it's averaging in that 2.2 Bcf range versus 2.3 Bcf last year.Can you talk about the considerations of inventory management and how that mix of lower versus upper is looking over time? Is this -- it seems like there is a multiyear shift now where you're going to be emphasizing the lower a bit more in the lower price environment. But just wondering if there's more nuance to it. And if your thoughts have changed on the inventory management side there?"", 'Thomas E. Jorden', ""Our thoughts really haven't changed. As we -- I would just repeat what we've said in the past. We've talked about a reduced inventory in the Lower Marcellus. I think if we were heavy on the Lower Marcellus, we'd probably be talking about a 3- to 5-year inventory at this point, 3 to 6 maybe depending on how -- our level of activity. Our inventory is longer than that now as we lowered our investment. But it's really a function of what's available to us. And that's the function of our gathering system where we think we have additional capacity.But there's also an area of this field that's opened up to us that we're out exploiting and we're really glad to be there and getting after some of the really, really productive rock.So we'll be drilling in Lower Marcellus for a long, long time. So when we quote inventory numbers, it's really strongly overprint by which formation we're drilling in. But -- the Lower is going to be a significant part of our program for a number of years."", 'David Adam Deckelbaum', ""Just also curious on the Permian embedded in this multiyear 5-plus percent oil growth outlook through '26. How many sort of projects similar to the size of Windham Row are you baking in, I guess, for a year? I know that there was an expectation that we would see sort of a large-scale project every year to 1.5 years. Is that still kind of the cadence baked into the multiyear guide? Or are there some early learnings from Windham Row that are kind of iterating that process now?"", 'Blake A. Sirgo', ""Yes, David, this is Blake. I'll take that one. Right now, we really expect to do a row project almost every single year. And I know that it's kind of scary to talk about a 51-well development. But I think it's important to remember, these are 6 distinct drill spacing units that we have chosen to develop in a row to maximize efficiencies. These units are our standard Culberson 2-mile Upper Wolfcamp unit with designs from 7 to 10 wells per section, this is just really our bread and butter. I mean, we've developed many of these over the years. We're just stringing them together.Our ops teams work really hard to kind of wargame these projects and these rows to think of all the execution risks that could go on. That's why we picked up our eighth rig sooner to get a good upbuild in front of the frac crew. These projects have large multi-well pads. That means if we have any well trouble, our frac crew can pivot while we deal with the well trouble, our simulfrac part of this project. We've modeled really conservative completion timing, and that's because it's our first application of this in Culberson, but we don't really expect our electric crew to operate any less efficient than it has in the past. We worked through a lot of sand and water logistics to make sure everything has abundant sourcing. We own and operate our SWD system out there. That means we have plenty of water on demand at all time. It allows us to keep it in the pipe, so we're not building any produced water pits with this project. This is just part of our operation now. And I'd expect many more row developments for years to come."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with Truist.', 'Neal David Dingmann', ""My first question is just on the flat spend and the 0% to 5% BOE CAGR. I'm just wondering, did these assumptions include -- I'm just wondering, do you assume with those on a go-forward years? Has that ensued well productivity, improved well productivity and lower well costs? Or maybe just help me on what's involved in those assumptions?"", 'Thomas E. Jorden', ""We don't project future advancements in advance of having achieved them. I think we will achieve them, but we don't -- we like to calibrate results. I mean, hopefully, that's not a surprise to anybody on this call. We'd not rather talk about results and promises.And I just want to say one more time. We don't manage our multiyear outlook by that production number. We look at projections of what we think is our assumed cash flow, we say how much of that cash flow do we want to invest, and that's typically in a fair way. I'm going to give a wide one, of 40% to 70%, and that allows us to achieve our shareholder returns that we've promised. And then with that, we say, okay, here's the capital, where is the best place to put it. And the very last part of that process is, what production does it generate? We don't get over our skis on that. We try to push our teams to model the most recent operational efficiencies. And then we drive them crazy, trying to get better. But production is not the input, it's the output of good, solid capital allocation."", 'Neal David Dingmann', ""Great point, Tom. And maybe just -- maybe a second along that same line. I'm just wondering, look at the slide that talks about the gas production. I'm just wondering, is it fair to say that you maybe have seen peak production? Or is it just -- what you're forecasting that are just the basis of what's going on with prices, and that's going to be an ultimate driver."", 'Thomas E. Jorden', ""Yes. It would not be fair to assume anything from our projection other than it's our current look at an uncertain future. We say that we have contingency plans if gas prices really recover, as we hope they will. Within our capital guide, we have plans to get back to work this year and set ourselves up for nice growth over the next 2 years. That's not a plan, but it's on the shelf, ready to go."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from the line of Michael Scialla with Stephens.', 'Michael Stephen Scialla', 'Just wanted to ask about your return of capital obviously way above your target for the year. But even with the bump in the dividend in the fourth quarter, it looks like you slowed that a little bit. I wanted to ask about that, and then also the decision to bump the base dividend when you had been leaning more towards the share buybacks when you pull back on the variable dividend. Why the bump in the base dividend rather than buying back more shares?', 'Shannon E. Young', ""Yes. Mike, Shane here. I'll take those 2 questions. Listen, on the buyback, we remained active in the market during the quarter, but we were a little bit cautious. We were trying to kind of get a gauge whether winter and weather would materialize. And I think as it didn't, we decided to carry some of that cash over into year-end. So that's why you saw the cash balance build up to around $1 billion, which really puts us in good shape in what looks like it could be a soft gas market in 2024 to be a bit more aggressive on the buyback. So there was a little bit of a timing element to that, I would say.On the base dividend, listen, in addition to the commitment to deliver 50% plus of our free cash flow to shareholders on an annual basis, we also remain committed to increasing the annual dividend responsibly on an annual cadence, 5% feels like a pretty good lift, but not overly excessive.So we're happy with the 5% bump. And when we get into next year, we'll evaluate it. Again, if it makes sense to do it, we would expect to continue to do it on an annual cadence."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup.', 'Scott Andrew Gruber', ""For your road development program, you've been able to push down your Delaware cost to sublet $1,100 a foot. As you reengage in Anadarko, do you think you'll be able to work down the cost structure in to play? Are you thinking about pad size, electrifying operations or any other actions to meaningfully push down that $1,300 figure?"", 'Blake A. Sirgo', ""Yes. This is Blake. I'm happy to take that one. Yes, we think there's always room to push our efficiencies further, and we do share a lot of our learnings across basins. But at the same time, the Anadarko is a different basin than the Permian. So it's deeper. It's higher pressure. The drilling can be more difficult. And really, what we've seen from our Anadarko team is we ran a real consistent program in 2023, so consistent drilling activity. And our crews did what they always do, they got better at it. And we saw our costs come down and get more in line. They're already taking advantage, a lot of the same pad efficiencies we see in the Permian. But if we saw opportunities to enlarge projects and get more economies of scale, we'll absolutely take advantage of those."", 'Scott Andrew Gruber', ""Got it. And you guys had stuck with an estimate of about 5% deflation in service costs and material cost, but we're now seeing several operators obviously take actions to reduce activity in the Marcellus. Do you think you'll be able to see additional service cost savings on the top of that 5%, especially in the Marcellus on your remaining activity?"", 'Blake A. Sirgo', ""I mean, I sure hope so. We'll see how the market plays out. The -- typically, when more services become available, it does drive pricing down. We've been very strategic how we've gone into '24 with our contracts. We're very, very lightly contracted, and that's by design, so we can take advantage of any downswings. But at the same time, who we work with and making sure we have premium service providers that share our safety culture and our drive for excellence is really important to us, and our service providers need to make a return also. So we'll be working with them closely. And if there's continued movement in the market, we'll be there to take advantage of it."", 'Thomas E. Jorden', ""But I don't want that point to be lost. One of the reasons we have such flexibility in our capital allocation is because we worked really hard over the last couple of years to have a great set of vendor partners and a very light amount of long-term commitments. So we really do have a lot of flexibility in both our drilling and completion services to pivot from one basin to another."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Kevin MacCurdy with Pickering Energy Partners.', 'Kevin Moreland MacCurdy', ""First, I want to say, we appreciate the 3-year outlook. I think you're one of the few companies in your peer group with the confidence in your inventory to provide a detailed multiyear outlook. My first question is on that outlook. Are you assuming a similar capital allocation in 2025 and 2026 as in 2024? And under that scenario, when and at what level does the Marcellus start to flatten out?"", 'Thomas E. Jorden', ""Yes. The answer, Kevin, is no. We're not assuming a similar level of allocation. That said, it's fluid, but the model that underpins that is a reallocated number."", 'Kevin Moreland MacCurdy', 'Okay. And under that 3-year scenario, what happens if we have a bullish gas market in 2025 and 2026, do you reallocate capital from the Permian and Anadarko back to the Marcellus? Or do you increase your overall CapEx? I know you spoke about a contingency plan in 2024, but just thinking about how you would think about that over the long term.', 'Thomas E. Jorden', ""Well, you've left a very nice wide opening for me with that question. Because, I say it's always our best look at current conditions. So if we had significant recovery in the gas macro, which we hope and expect, our cash flow goes way up. And within that investment fairway, I said 40% to 70%, we probably would have the flexibility to look at increasing our capital. But none of that is enshrined in our current outlook because we don't -- there's no hope in any of the outlooks around here. But we'll react when conditions change."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from the line of Ati Modak with Goldman Sachs.', 'Atidrip Modak', ""Just curious how you view the macro setup for the gas market share. What's the risk of surprise in associated gas in the Permian? And how do we work our way through that? Are you seeing sufficient signs of supplier rationalization to suggest that we're in a better environment for '25?"", 'Shannon E. Young', ""Yes. It's Shane here. I'll start off on that. Look, it's very challenging today. And as we look at the storage numbers and the weather picture as it's played out, winter to date and the way the outlook is for the next several weeks.Look, we could sort of end the winter at a pretty high spot on a historical basis. Production on the other side has been incredibly resilient, probably more so than many of us have expected. It's great to see -- to hear some discipline in the marketplace. But it's unclear that it's enough, and it's unclear that it's sort of broad-based enough at this point. So we're cautious on gas, and you see that in our 2024 planning and budgeting, you see that in the way we manage our balance sheet. But if it does turn and when it does turn, we'll certainly be prepared to react."", 'Atidrip Modak', ""Great. And then you talked about this a little bit, but maybe I can approach this in a different way. your 3-year outlook on growth is on relatively stable annual CapEx. Curious what factors you've baked into that growth outlook in terms of the incremental efficiency gains. What should we expect to hear from you on that front over this time period?"", 'Blake A. Sirgo', ""We don't bake in any incremental efficiency gains. So we take all our most recent gains in our program. We kind of stress test those by going through them extensively to make sure they're real and part of our program. And then we build them into our forecasting. And so while our expectation is our teams will continue to drive efficiencies, none of that's built into these projections."", 'Operator', 'Our final question will come from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.', 'Charles Arthur Meade', ""I have 2 questions on the Marcellus. You've addressed some of this, but I just want to make one more run at it. If we look at the decrement of $435 million in CapEx in '24 versus '23. And you look at that versus, you went from 2 rigs to 1 rig and 1 frac crew to maybe a half frac crew, it seems like the decrement in activity is smaller than the decrement in CapEx. And so what are the other pieces that complete that picture?"", 'Thomas E. Jorden', ""One of the things that we see is, we will finish the year with 4 pads waiting to be completed. So a lot of what we're doing in '24 is setting up '25. So it's not always showing up in the first year CapEx.With -- projects have cycle times like ours and like everybody else's, you really have to have a multiyear outlook on any plan. So a lot of that is benefit of what we did last year that's currently being completed. And what happens next year is a function of what we do this year.So the annual snapshot on capital versus production is interesting, but fairly incomplete."", 'Charles Arthur Meade', ""Right. That makes sense. And then maybe one other question. You have on your slide, I believe it's Slide 6, you showed that 10% decline in Marcellus production for '24, but then -- and actually a slight incline for '25. What's the underlying price assumption for natural gas in that scenario where you grow again in '25?"", 'Thomas E. Jorden', ""Well, we have lots of price assumptions. I would say we have strip. We run a $55 & $2.75, we run a $75 & $2.50. I mean, we have -- we run a $75 & $3.75. I'm looking at our models now. I mean we have a smorgasbord of price files that really set our -- kind of define the fairway of our economic analysis. But I would say this is probably based on the strip as a foundational forecast, and then we learn permutations from there."", 'Operator', ""I'll now turn the call back over to Tom Jorden for any closing remarks."", 'Thomas E. Jorden', ""Well, thank you very much for joining us. We look forward to continuing to deliver. As I hope you've learned from Coterra, we really appreciate your interest and love talking about results and we intend to deliver them. So thank you so much."", 'Operator', 'Everyone, this does conclude our conference call for today. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.']"

When finding the right dividend stocks to buy, investors can usually not go wrong sticking with industry-leading companies that have been around for years.', ""That said, let's look at why three Motley Fool contributors believe Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), Home Depot (NYSE: HD), and Realty Income (NYSE: O) are great income stocks to buy right now."", 'John Ballard (Coca-Cola): Successful dividend investing is all about looking for a track record of sustainability. Coca-Cola has been around since 1886, and it has increased the quarterly dividend for 63 consecutive years. The stock currently offers a yield of 3.17%, higher than the consumer-staples average of 1.89%.', 'Coke benefits from a large portfolio of brands spanning carbonated beverages, juices, and tea. The power of these brands translates to massive sales volumes every year, where over 2.2 billion servings of its beverage products are consumed globally every year. That makes it an ideal dividend stock to boost the average yield of your investment portfolio.', ""Investors can expect the dividend to keep growing. With several international markets still in the developing stages of spreading more soft-drink consumption, Coke's unit sales volume probably has a long runway of growth ahead. That's one reason management believes it can achieve 4% to 6% top-line growth and 7% to 9% earnings growth on an annualized basis."", ""The shares are fairly valued at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 21.7. When we combine the stock's 3%-plus yield on top of high-single-digit earnings growth potential, investors can expect to earn a low double-digit annualized return on their investment over the long term."", 'Jeremy Bowman (Home Depot): Home Depot has dominated the home-improvement retail industry for a generation, and it shows little sign of giving up its leadership.', ""Demand for Home Depot's products, including raw materials such as lumber, power tools, gardening supplies, appliances, and fixtures, isn't going anywhere, and much of its business is Amazon-proof, with high barriers to entry."", 'The company should also benefit in the coming years from a shortage of housing, as some economists estimate that the U.S. needs an additional 4 million homes to reach market equilibrium and satisfy demand. The company estimates its addressable home improvement retail market to be worth $950 billion.', ""Recent results at Home Depot haven't been encouraging, since the housing market has been cyclically weak. The company just wrapped up a year in which comparable sales were down 3.2% and revenue fell 3%. That weighed on the bottom line, as earnings per share were down 9.5% to $15.11."", 'CEO Ted Decker described 2023 as a year of moderation, and management expects similar headwinds in 2024, calling for revenue growth of just 1%, which includes the benefit of a 53rd week, and a 1% increase in EPS.', 'However, Home Depot should return to steady growth once interest rates fall and the housing market strengthens. The company also remains a dividend stalwart. It just declared its 148th consecutive quarterly dividend, a streak dating to the early days of the business. It currently offers a 2.3% dividend yield and has a history of strong dividend increases, typically in the double-digit percentages.', ""If you're looking for a dividend stock to count in retirement, Home Depot looks like a great choice, with its resilient business model and history of dividend hikes, and now looks like a good buying opportunity, with the stock in a cyclical downturn."", ""Jennifer Saibil (Realty Income): Every retirement account should have some real estate investment trust (REIT) stocks, and Realty Income stands out as one of the best. It has everything a dividend investor should be looking for: a high yield, a proven track record of dividend increases, and reliability. It also has something most other dividend stock can't boast: It pays monthly."", ""REITs are a class of stocks that own properties, typically of a specific type. They pay out 90% of their income as dividends, which is why they're great for passive income. Realty Income is a retail REIT, and it leases space to large chain retailers such as Walmart (NYSE: WMT) and Lowe's (NYSE: LOW). It's made two large acquisitions over the past two years and made several sale-leaseback deals that have added thousands of new properties to its total, and it has expanded into new areas such as gaming, with a sale-leaseback arrangement with Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ: WYNN)."", ""It's highly diversified, with 1,326 tenants in 86 industries. However, 81% are in retail. Its largest industries and tenants are resilient businesses, and it consistently reports occupancy rates near 100%."", ""Realty Income stock is down 21% over the past year because of the suppressed real estate market. But Realty Income is well capitalized to buy more properties, and it reported adjusted funds from operations of $4 in 2023, up from $3.92 the year before. It's managing well through the real estate turbulence and is well positioned to keep it up for the foreseeable future."", ""At this price, Realty Income's dividend yields 5.6%. It has paid a dividend for 644 months consecutively -- that's more than 53 years -- with 105 quarterly increases. It's adding properties and income and sees a large opportunity ahead, and it's a top pick for reliable passive income."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

Invest in a diverse selection of quality companies and hold on to them for the long term -- ideally, about 20 players or more for at least a decade. Over time, they could deliver top returns and set you on the path to financial freedom."", ""But don't worry: You don't have to rush out and buy 20 stocks all at once. You can pick up a few here and there and gradually add to your portfolio according to your budget. Investing is a lifetime pursuit, so you have plenty of time to build and benefit from a winning portfolio."", 'So, where should you start? Whether you\'re a new or a seasoned investor, picking up a few companies that may be ""easy"" wealth builders is always a great idea. By this, I mean companies that have demonstrated their ability over time to grow earnings and/or dividends, as well as players that offer promising prospects. Let\'s check out three to add to your portfolio now.', ""Carnival (NYSE: CCL) (NYSE: CUK) had a difficult time during the earlier days of the pandemic as it was forced to halt sailings, but the world's biggest cruise operator has shown its ability to recover -- and grow. This is thanks to cutting costs, streamlining operations, and taking steps to favor profitability. For example, Carnival eliminated older ships that use a lot of fuel, replacing them with a fuel-efficient fleet."", 'At the same time, demand for cruising and travel in general has returned, and Carnival has seen the impact of this in recent earnings reports. In full-year 2023, Carnival reported revenue of $21.6 billion, an all-time high. The company also entered the new year with the best-booked position ever from price and occupancy standpoints.', ""Carnival has started paying down debt as well, reducing it by more than $4 billion from its peak early last year. Even better, Carnival's ongoing gains in adjusted free cash flow show us the company has what it takes to keep lowering the debt it built up earlier during the health crisis."", ""Meanwhile, Carnival's shares trade near their lowest ever in relation to sales, making now a great buying opportunity for a player likely to deliver when it comes to earnings and share performance over time."", 'Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) has delivered steady share price gains over time, but the picture looks even better when we consider the performance with dividend payments included. This shows that the 62% share gain over a decade actually becomes a 123% increase when we include the passive income.', ""So, Coca-Cola can help build your wealth, thanks to the annual payments it delivers -- regardless of its share performance during that particular year. And there's reason to believe the company will not only continue payments but also increase them year after year. That's because Coca-Cola, as a Dividend King, has already boosted its dividend annually for over 50 years. This shows that rewarding shareholders is important to the company, so it's reasonable to expect Coca-Cola to continue this policy."", ""The world's largest nonalcoholic beverage maker also has the financial power to ensure this happens, with more than $9.7 billion in free cash flow."", ""Finally, thanks to Coca-Cola's brand strength and presence in more than 200 countries and territories, you can be confident this company also will deliver when it comes to earnings. Even in tough economic times, like last year, earnings continued to gain."", 'So, trading for 21x forward earnings estimates, Coca-Cola looks like a great value right now.', ""Costco (NASDAQ: COST) shares have climbed more than 40% over the past year, but it's not too late to get in on this unstoppable stock -- and likely wealth builder. What I like most about Costco is its business model, which involves a membership system. This ensures Costco generates revenue from you before you even set foot in one of its warehouses to do your shopping."", ""And memberships are high margin for Costco because they don't involve the costs associated with buying, transporting, and stocking items. So, this means Costco actually generates more profit from membership fees than from selling grocery and general merchandise items in its warehouses. In more good news, members have steadily renewed their memberships at rates over 90%, both in the U.S. and internationally."", 'Finally, Costco continues to grow its executive- or higher-level memberships, which now represent about 46% of total memberships and more than 73% of sales globally.', ""Meanwhile, members have driven steady earnings growth -- into the billions of dollars annually -- at Costco. Finally, the warehouse giant not only pays dividends but has also offered investors five special dividends over 11 years. So, even though Costco trades at 46x forward earnings, it's worth the premium for those looking for a potential wealth builder."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Carnival Corp. right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Carnival Corp., consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Carnival Corp. wasn’t one of them.

The new flavor is part of a larger effort to lean into ""a flavor for every day of the week.""', 'The company also announced its JIF peanut butter brand will launch a peanut butter and chocolate spread this summer. ""Over 70% of peanut butter buyers are not purchasing a chocolate-flavor spread today, and we anticipate this innovation will be highly incremental to the brand,"" J.M. Smucker CEO Mark Smucker said.', 'Packaging innovation offers another opportunity. PepsiCo chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta said the company has invested in updating its packaging for “portion control” and “portability” as customers snack more throughout the day.', '“We want to make sure that consumers can find us in many more occasions,” he said. Pepsi is also leaning into powders and tablets, “giving consumers the opportunity to find Gatorade or to use Gatorade in a much different way.”', 'Food giants are also reengaging consumers through marketing campaigns with new partners.', ""Hershey, for example, excited the CAGNY conference crowd by bringing in NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal to announce a partnership to “win” in the gummy segment, the fastest-growing sweets segment.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. That's why when we briefly looked at Coca-Cola's (NYSE:KO) ROCE trend, we were pretty happy with what we saw."", ""For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Coca-Cola:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.18 = US$13b ÷ (US$98b - US$24b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""So, Coca-Cola has an ROCE of 18%.  On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 15% generated by the Beverage industry."", ' View our latest analysis for Coca-Cola ', ""In the above chart we have measured Coca-Cola's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Coca-Cola ."", ""While the returns on capital are good, they haven't moved much. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 18% and the business has deployed 36% more capital into its operations. 18% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that Coca-Cola has consistently earned this amount. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns."", ""One more thing to note, even though ROCE has remained relatively flat over the last five years, the reduction in current liabilities to 24% of total assets, is good to see from a business owner's perspective. This can eliminate some of the risks inherent in the operations because the business has less outstanding obligations to their suppliers and or short-term creditors than they did previously."", 'The main thing to remember is that Coca-Cola has proven its ability to continually reinvest at respectable rates of return. And since the stock has risen strongly over the last five years, it appears the market might expect this trend to continue. So even though the stock might be more ""expensive"" than it was before, we think the strong fundamentals warrant this stock for further research.', ""Like most companies, Coca-Cola does come with some risks, and we've found 1 warning sign  that you should be aware of."", ""While Coca-Cola may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

And on the heels of the numbers, we'll be hearing from a slew of Fed officials, who are pushing back expectations for a rate cut until later this year."", ""So PCE, Julie, that's what we're focused on. That is Jay Powell's preferred gauge. Of course, recent inflation gauges maybe not so great relative to expectations, CPI, PPI. With PC expectations 2.4% year-over-year, that would be ticking down from 2.6% we saw last time."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. And one of the things that people are watching is that one of the components in, I believe, it was PPI that are asset management fees that have been going up.

After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] With that, I’ll now turn the call over to Kim Watkins, Intuit’s Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Watkins?', 'Kim Watkins: Thanks, Angela. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit’s second quarter fiscal 2024 conference call. I’m here with Intuit’s CEO, Sasan Goodarzi; and our CFO, Sandeep Aujla. Before we start, I’d like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit’s results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2023 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit’s website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis.', 'We’ve reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today’s press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior-year period, and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Sasan.', 'Sasan Goodarzi: Thanks Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We had another strong quarter and have great momentum innovating on our platform. We’re executing on our strategy to be the global AI-driven expert platform powering prosperity for consumers and small businesses. Second quarter revenue grew by 11%, and we are on track to achieve our fiscal year 2024 full year guidance of 11% to 12% revenue growth while expanding operating margins. Let’s start with tax. We are confident in our innovation and game plan to win, and are reiterating our full fiscal year guidance of 7% to 8% revenue growth for the Consumer Group. Tax preparation represents a $35 billion TAM. This includes $31 billion within the assisted consumer and business tax categories, which we have barely started to penetrate.', 'We are well-positioned to disrupt the assisted category by leveraging data, AI, and our Virtual Expert Platform, to revolutionize how taxes get done for consumers and small businesses. By leveraging the power of our platform and ecosystem, we’re also extending TurboTax to our Credit Karma members and QuickBooks Online small business customers by enabling them to complete their taxes and access expertise directly within these products. Let me share more about our – the areas of focus this season. First, we can serve consumers however they want to file, virtually or in-person, while providing confidence their taxes are being done accurately and they are getting their maximum refund. More than 80% of U.S. filers live within a 10 mile radius of a TurboTax expert.', 'These experts use Intuit’s Virtual Expert Platform that’s powered by data and AI, to deliver best-in-class service. While it’s early in the season, TurboTax Live Full Service is resonating with customers. We’re seeing strong growth and the offering has a Product Recommendation Score of 88 season-to-date, one of the highest at Intuit. Second, small businesses can file their taxes with TurboTax and, if a small business is a QuickBooks Online customer, they can file their taxes with an expert. With these offerings, they can maximize their refund, and get advice from experts when they need it. Our campaigns and easy to use experience are driving strong early interest. Business tax returns have a much higher average revenue per return because they are more complex and we expect them to contribute to average revenue per return expansion over time.', 'Third, we’re more deeply integrating Credit Karma and TurboTax, making it even more seamless for Credit Karma members to file with TurboTax directly in the Credit Karma app, with exclusive offers for members, whether they want to file themselves or with an expert. We’re also unlocking the benefits of the Credit Karma platform for tax filers to make smart money decisions. This includes earlier access to their refund or, for those that qualify, access to an interest-free Refund Advance loan in as little as 30 seconds after IRS acceptance, when depositing their refund into a Credit Karma Money account. This is designed to lead to higher engagement and monetization in Credit Karma over time. Fourth, Intuit Assist, our GenAI powered financial assistant, is live in TurboTax this season.', 'With Intuit Assist, we are creating a future of ""done for you,"" where the hard work is done ""automagically"" on behalf of our customers with a gateway to human expertise, fueling their financial success. For example, customers are using Intuit Assist to better understand their refund. In early results, Intuit Assist’s helpfulness rating is 1.5x greater than our legacy explanations, indicating Intuit Assist is helping deliver confidence to TurboTax customers. Our focus this tax season further showcases how our Big Bets have accelerated innovation and growth for the future. We’re leveraging the power of data and AI with Intuit Assist to revolutionize the speed to benefit for customers, disrupting the assisted consumer and business tax categories by connecting people with experts virtually, and bringing the TurboTax and Credit Karma experience together to unlock smart money decisions.', 'We are off to a great start in tax. Let me now highlight progress across two of our Big Bets. As a reminder, our five Big Bets are: revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth, and disrupt the small business mid-market. Our first big bet is to ""revolutionize speed to benefit."" Our platform enables us to innovate for our customers with speed and at scale, which is foundational to all of our other Big Bets. Five years ago, we declared our strategy to be an AI-driven expert platform, with data and AI fueling innovation across the platform. At the core of our platform is powerful, relevant data for our 100 million customers. We have 500,000 customer and financial attributes per small business, and 60,000 financial and tax attributes per consumer which fuels what’s possible with AI.', 'And with our GenAI Operating System, GenOS, we empower Intuit technologists to create breakthrough GenAI experiences across our platform. This includes utilizing our own powerful financial LLMs, as well as those from other leaders in GenAI, which together unlock new opportunities to serve our customers with accuracy and speed in a cost efficient way. As I mentioned earlier, with Intuit Assist, we are creating a future of ""done for you,"" where the hard work is done ""automagically"" on behalf of our customers with a gateway to human expertise, fueling their success. Intuit Assist is critical to delivering unparalleled benefits for our customers over the next decade, and is in the hands of select customers now. We believe Intuit Assist will lead to higher frequency of engagement and monetization across the platform, driving customer growth, accelerated adoption of services and live offerings.', 'I’m excited about the rapid pace at which we are innovating, testing, learning, and adapting to deliver our core benefits of more money, no work and complete confidence for customers. Let me share a few updates. First TurboTax, as I shared earlier, Intuit Assist is live in the product this season and is delivering increased confidence to our customers. Second, Mailchimp, to help small businesses grow revenue and save them time, we’re providing AI-powered automations and content generation using Intuit Assist. Third, QuickBooks, Intuit Assist is in beta and is designed to help small businesses optimize cash flow and make confident decisions to grow their business. New customers who were previously running their business manually will be able to get started quickly by sharing their email, website and bank account information.', 'Their unstructured data will be translated into benefits for them, such as generating customized pay-enabled invoices that save time and enable customers to get paid faster, experiencing the benefits of switching to a digital platform. And for existing customers, we will translate their data and analyze their money in and money out transactions into insights and recommendations. Intuit Assist will do the work for our customers in the background with suggested automated actions that increases customer productivity by saving time and leading to better outcomes such as getting paid faster and updating capital. Furthermore, we intend to provide an option to connect and interact with an expert to help provide insights and make decisions specific to their financial situation and fuel their success at the moments that matter most, such as closing their books.', 'Fourth, Credit Karma, Intuit Assist for Credit Karma is in beta and we’re excited about the rapid innovation and the progress we’re making to help connect members to financial products that are right for them, saving them time and money. We’re focused on using GenAI to interact with members to help answer their questions in a highly personalized way when shopping for financial products. Customers can interact, learn more, and ask questions to help make confident decisions. Intuit Assist will engage more members with a wide range of financial needs beyond Credit. We recently expanded by 6x the number of topics we can provide help on and now address items like major purchases, home buying, savings, and more. We believe this can drive increased member engagement and conversion, and drive higher revenue per monthly active user.', 'We remain excited with our early progress with Intuit Assist across the company. It’s changing our relationship with customers as we move from being a transactional workflow platform to a trusted assistant that customers can rely on daily to power their prosperity. Our fourth big bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get new customers, get paid fast, manage capital, and pay employees with confidence in an omnichannel world. We are well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers to help them grow and run their business. In Mailchimp, we’re focused on better serving mid market customers across different stages of their lifecycle to drive higher engagement and retention. After we have successfully onboarded them, we’re pairing larger customers with an account manager to help them understand and adopt the breadth of Mailchimp’s capabilities.', 'We’re seeing green shoots from account management, which gives us confidence in the future. Customers who have engaged with an account manager have higher monthly revenue retention. We believe this will also drive higher ARPC over time. Intuit Assist is live in Mailchimp’s higher end offerings and is designed to help customers develop personalized marketing campaigns and drive their revenue growth. We’re offering customers three AI-powered automations today, including new customer welcome, abandoned shopping cart and recovering lost customers. Automations are time consuming to set up, but can drive higher revenue. Intuit Assist personalized automations are 50% more likely to be activated by customers. Intuit Assist is also reducing work by generating new content and editing existing content for marketing campaigns.', 'Recent improvements have driven GenAI text generation adoption rates by more than 70% over the past several months, reducing work for our customers. Getting paid fast remains a big challenge for small businesses. We are uniquely positioned to help customers with our end-to-end money platform and innovations such as easy discovery, auto-enabled payments, payment-enabled invoices, instant deposit and get paid up front, which are all helping our customers get paid faster and drive adoption of payments. Total online payment volume growth was 20% in the quarter. We are beginning to roll out a new payment-enabled invoicing experience that will provide more benefits to customers, including more ways to get paid. While early, we’re seeing that customers who use the new invoicing experience are engaging more driving increase in customer adoption of our payment rails to get their invoices paid.', 'We’re also making progress digitizing B2B payments to accelerate and automate transactions between small businesses and ultimately improve their cash flow. The number of connections in our QuickBooks business network has doubled since August, and we’re pleased with the initial adoption of our bill pay offering. To better serve small businesses, during the quarter, we began rolling out faster payment timelines for qualified customers that reduce payment time by 40%, including a paid next-day ACH option and batch payments, allowing customers to hold on to their cash longer and save time. Wrapping up, with our durable AI-driven expert platform strategy and focus on innovating with GenAI across our platform, we are more excited than ever about the opportunity in front of us, and our ability to power prosperity for our customers.', 'We’re honored to be recognized by Bloomberg as one of the top 50 Companies to Watch in 2024 and to be ranked 22 on this year’s Just 100, and the highest ranked customer or software company on the list. Now let me hand it over to Sandeep.', 'Sandeep Aujla: Thanks, Sasan. For the second quarter of fiscal 2024 we delivered another strong quarter, despite the IRS opening approximately one week later this year. We achieved healthy operating margins and are on track to achieve our full year guidance as we continue to deliver operating leverage across the business. Our Q2 results include revenue of $3.4 billion, up 11%, GAAP operating income of $369 million versus $270 million last year, up 37%. Non-GAAP operating income of $1 billion versus $856 million last year, up 17%. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.25 versus $0.60 a year ago and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.63 versus $2.20 last year, up 20%. Turning to our business segments. Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue grew 18% during the quarter, driven by online ecosystem revenue, which grew 21%.', 'Our results continue to demonstrate the power of our small business platform and the mission-critical nature of our offerings, which resonates with customers as they look to grow their business and improve cash flow in any economic environment. With the goal of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within the small business and self-employed group is threefold: grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online Accounting revenue grew 19% in Q2, driven mainly by customer growth, higher effective prices and mix shift. We continue to prioritize disrupting the small business mid-market through continued focus on both go-to-market and product innovations.', 'While mid-market customers are a smaller subset of the total small business TAM, they drive a higher ARPC over time given their more complex needs and higher usage of services across our platform. This coupled with our strategy to sell more of our ecosystem services to existing customers, shift the emphasis in our growth formula towards ARPC over time. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue grew 24% in Q2, driven by payroll, payments, Mailchimp, capital and time tracking. Within payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects an increase in customers adopting our payroll solutions, higher effective prices and a mix shift towards higher end offerings. Within payments, the revenue growth in the quarter reflects ongoing customer growth as more customers adopt our payment offerings to manage their cash flow, higher effective prices and an increase in total payment volume per customer.', 'Mailchimp revenue growth was driven by higher effective prices and paid customer growth. Third, we continue to make progress expanding globally by executing a refreshed international strategy, which includes leading with both QuickBooks Online and Mailchimp in our established markets and leading with Mailchimp in all other markets as we continue to execute on localized product and lineup. On a constant currency basis, total international online ecosystem revenue grew 16% in Q2. Now moving to our Desktop Ecosystem. Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 10% in the second quarter, and QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew in the mid-teens. We are more than two years into a three-year transition for customers that remain on a license-based desktop offering to a recurring subscription model.', 'In fiscal 2025, the tailwinds from the three-year transition will be behind us, but we expect our Desktop Enterprise offering, which accounts for over half of desktop accounting revenue to grow in the high single-digit range. We also will continue to encourage remaining desktops subscription customers who tend to be more complex and higher value to migrate seamlessly to either QuickBooks Online or our desktop enterprise offering when they are ready. Additionally, we see opportunities to continue to price the product for value. The online ecosystem remains a growth catalyst longer term. Shifting to our Consumer and ProTax Groups. Our full year outlook remains unchanged, even though Consumer Group revenue declined 5% in the quarter, reflecting an approximately one week later IRS opened this year.', 'We are confident in our game plan to win this season and are reiterating our guidance for Consumer Group of 7% to 8% revenue growth in fiscal 2024. Turning to the ProTax Group, the revenue grew 8% to $274 million in Q2, reflecting the timing of when tax forms were delivered, which is a driver for revenue recognition. Moving to Credit Karma. Credit Karma delivered revenue of $375 million in Q2, flat to a year ago, primarily reflecting growth in Credit Karma Money, credit cards and auto loans offset by decline in home loans, personal loans and auto insurance. We saw select partners taking a conservative approach to extending credit in both personal loans and credit cards in Q2, reflecting expected macro trends. And as a reminder, Q2 is typically the seasonally weakest quarter of the year.', 'We expect Q3 to benefit from additional Credit Karma Money revenue during tax season. In summary, I am pleased with our continued momentum this fiscal year. Now shifting to our balance sheet and capital allocation. Our financial principles guide our decisions. They remain our long-term commitment and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with $1.5 billion in cash and investments and $6 billion in debt on our balance sheet. We repurchased $536 million of stock during the second quarter. Depending on our market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share, payable on April 18, 2024. This represents a 15% increase versus last year. Moving on to guidance. We are reaffirming our fiscal 2024 guidance.', 'This includes total company revenue growth of 11% to 12% and GAAP operating income growth of 15% to 18%; non-GAAP operating income growth of 12% to 14%. GAAP earnings per share growth of 11% to 15% and non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 12% to 14%. Our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 includes revenue growth of 10% to 11%, GAAP earnings per share of $7.77 to $7.84, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $9.31 to $9.38. As a reminder, we are taking a prudent approach with guidance given the continued macroeconomic uncertainty. You can find our full year fiscal 2024 and Q3 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. With that, I’ll turn it back over to Sasan.', 'Sasan Goodarzi: Great. Thank you, Sandeep. And just to quickly wrap up, we’re very confident in our AI-driven expert platform strategy, our progress with our five big bets, and creating a future of done for you with a gateway to human expertise. We believe that this will change our relationship with our customers, becoming their trusted advisors, leading to higher engagement and monetization.

Goodarzi', ""Thanks, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We had another strong quarter and have great momentum innovating on our platform. We're executing on our strategy to be the global AI-driven expert platform powering prosperity for consumers and small businesses. Second quarter revenue grew by 11%, and we're on track to achieve our fiscal year 2024 full year guidance of 11% to 12% revenue growth while expanding operating margins. Let's start with tax. We're confident in our innovation and game plan to win and are reiterating our full fiscal year guidance of 7% to 8% revenue growth for the Consumer Group. Tax preparation represents a $35 billion TAM. This includes $31 billion within the assisted consumer and business tax categories, which we have barely started to penetrate. We're well positioned to disrupt the assisted category by leveraging data, AI and our virtual expert platform to revolutionize how taxes get done for consumers and small businesses. By leveraging the power of our platform and ecosystem, we're also extending TurboTax to our Credit Karma members and QuickBooks online small business customers by enabling them to complete their taxes and access expertise directly within these products. Let me share more about the areas of focus this season. First, we can serve consumers however they want to file virtually or in person while providing confidence their taxes are being done accurately and they are getting their maximum refund. More than 80% of U.S. filers live within 10-mile radius of a TurboTax expert. These experts use Intuit's virtual expert platform that's powered by data and AI to deliver best-in-class service.While it's early in the season, TurboTax Live Full Service is resonating with customers. We're seeing strong growth, and the offering has a product recommendation score of 88 season to date, one of the highest at Intuit.Second, small businesses can file their taxes with TurboTax. And if a small business is a QuickBooks Online customer they can file their taxes with an expert. With these offerings, they can maximize their refund and get advice from experts when they need it. Our campaigns and easy-to-use experience are driving strong early interest.Business tax returns at a much higher average revenue per return because they are more complex, and we expect them to contribute to average revenue per return expansion over time. Third, we're more deeply integrating Credit Karma and TurboTax, making it even more seamless for Credit Karma members to file with TurboTax directly in the Credit Karma app with exclusive offers for members whether they want to find themselves or with an expert. We're also unlocking the benefits of the Credit Karma platform for tax filers to make smart money decisions. This includes earlier access to the refund or for those that qualify, access to an industry refund advance loan in as little as 30 seconds after IRS acceptance when depositing the refund into a Credit Karma money account. This is designed to lead to higher engagement and monetization in Credit Karma over time.Fourth, Intuit Assist, our Gen AI-powered financial assistant is live in TurboTax this season. With Intuit Assist, we are creating a future of done for you where the hard work is done automatically on behalf of our customers with a gateway to human expertise, fueling their financial success.For example, Customers are using Intuit just to better understand their refund. In early results, Intuitive's helpfulness rating is 1.5x greater than our legacy explanation, indicating Intuit Assist is helping deliver confidence to TurboTax customers.Our focus this tax season further showcases how our big bets have accelerated innovation and growth for the future. We're leveraging the power of data and AI with Intuit Assist to revolutionize speed to benefit for customers disrupting the assisted consumer and business tax categories by connecting people with experts virtually and bringing the TurboTax and Credit Karma experience together to unlock smart money decisions. We're off to a great start in tax.Let me now highlight progress across 2 of our big bets. As a reminder, our 5 big bets are revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth and disrupt the small business mid-market.Our first big bet is to revolutionize speed to benefit. Our platform enables us to innovate for our customers with speed and at scale, which is foundational to all of our big bets. 5 years ago, we declared our strategy to be an AI-driven expert platform with data and AI fueling innovation across the platform.At the core of our platform is powerful, relevant data for our 100 million customers. We have 500,000 customer and financial attributes per small business and 60,000 financial and tax attributes per consumer, which fuels what's possible with AI.And with our GenAI operating system, GenOS, we empower Intuit technologists to create breakthrough Gene experiences across our platform. This includes utilizing our own powerful financial LLM as well as those from other leaders in GenAI, which together unlock new opportunities to serve our customers with accuracy and speed in a cost-efficient way.As I mentioned earlier, with Intuit Assist, we're creating a future of done for you where the hard work is done automatically on behalf of our customers with a gateway human expertise fueling their success. Intuit Assist is critical to delivering unparalleled benefits for our customers over the next decade and is in the hands of select customers now.We believe Intuit Assist will lead to higher frequency of engagement and monetization across the platform, driving customer growth, accelerated adoption of services and live offerings. I'm really excited about the rapid pace at which we're innovating, testing, learning and adapting to deliver our core benefits of more money, no work and complete confidence for customers.Let me share a few updates. First, TurboTax. As I shared earlier, Intuit Assist is live in the product this season and is delivering increased confidence to our customers. Second, Mailchimp. To help small businesses grow revenue and save them time, we're providing AI-powered automation and content generation using Intuit Assist.Third, QuickBooks. Intuit Assist is in beta and is designed to help solve businesses optimize cash flow and make confident decisions to grow their business. New customers who were previously running their business manually will be able to get started quickly by sharing their e-mail, website and bank account information. Their unstructured data will be translated into benefits for them, such as generating customized pay-enabled invoices that save time and enable customers to get paid faster, experiencing the benefits of switching to a digital platform.And for existing customers, we will translate their data and analyze their money in and money out transactions into insights and recommendations. Intuit Assist, we'll do the work for our customers in the background with suggested automated actions that increases customer productivity by saving time and leading to better outcomes such as getting paid faster and obtaining capital.Furthermore, we intend to provide an option to connect and interact with an expert to help provide insight and make decisions specific to their financial situation and fuel their success at the moments that matter most, such as closing their books.Fourth, Credit Karma. Intuit Assist for Credit Karma is in beta, and we're excited about the rapid innovation and the progress we're making to help connect members to financial products that are right for them, saving them time and money. We're focused on using GenAI to interact with members to help answer their questions in a highly personalized way when shopping for financial products.Customers can interact, learn more and ask questions to help make confident decisions. Intuit Assist will engage more members with a wide range of financial needs beyond credit. We recently expanded by 6x the number of topics we can provide help on and now address items like major purchases, home buying, savings and more. We believe this can drive increased member engagement and conversion and drive higher revenue per monthly active user.We remain excited with our early progress with Intuit Assist across the company. It's changing our relationship with customers as we move from being a transactional workflow platform to a trusted assistant that customers can rely on daily to power their prosperity.Our fourth big bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get new customers, get paid fast, manage capital and pay employees with confidence in an omnichannel world. We are well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers to help them grow and run their business.In Mailchimp, we're focused on better serving mid-market customers across different stages of their life cycle to drive higher engagement and retention. After we have successfully onboarded them, we're pairing larger customers with an account manager to help them understand and adopt the breadth of Mailchimp's capabilities. We're seeing green shoots from account management, which gives us confidence in the future. Customers who have engaged with an account manager have higher monthly revenue retention. We believe this will also drive higher ARPC over time.Intuit Assist is live in Mailchimp's higher-end offerings and is designed to help customers develop personalized marketing campaigns and drive their revenue growth. We're offering customers 3 AI-powered automations today, including new customer welcome, abandoned shopping cart and recovering lost customers. Automations are time consuming to set up, but can drive higher revenue.Intuit Assist personalized automations are 50% more likely to be activated by customers. Intuit Assist is also reducing work by generating new content and editing existing content for marketing campaigns. Recent improvements have driven GenAI text generation adoption rates by more than 70% over the past several months, reducing work for our customers.Getting paid fast remains a big challenge for small businesses. We're uniquely positioned to help customers with our end-to-end money platform and innovations such as easy discovery, auto enabled payments, payment-enabled invoices, instant deposits and get paid up front, which are all helping our customers get paid faster and drive adoption of payments.Total online payment volume growth was 20% in the quarter. We're beginning to roll out a new payment-enabled invoicing experience that will provide more benefits to customers, including more ways to get paid. While early, we're seeing that customers who use the new invoicing experience are engaging more driving increase in customer adoption of our payment rails to get their invoices paid.We're also making progress digitizing B2B payments to accelerate and automate transactions between small businesses and ultimately improve their cash flow. The number of connections in our QuickBooks business network has doubled since August, and we're pleased with the initial adoption of our bill pay offering.To better serve small businesses, during the quarter, we began rolling out faster payment time lines for qualified customers that reduce payment time by 40%, including a paid next-day ACH option and batch payments, allowing customers to hold on to their cash longer and save time.We're wrapping up with our durable AI-driven expert platform strategy and focus on innovating with Gen AI across our platform, we're more excited than ever about the opportunity in front of us and our ability to power prosperity for our customers. We're honored to be recognized by Bloomberg as one of the top 50 companies to watch in 2024, and to be rank 22 on this year's Just 100, and the highest ranked customer or software company on the list.Now let me hand it over to Sandeep."", 'Sandeep Singh Aujla', ""Thanks, Sasan. For the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we delivered another strong quarter despite the IRS opening approximately 1 week later this year. We achieved healthy operating margin and are on track to achieve our full year guidance as we continue to deliver operating leverage across the business.Our Q2 results include revenue of $3.4 billion, up 11%, GAAP operating income of $369 million versus $270 million last year, up 37%. Non-GAAP operating income of $1 billion versus $856 million last year, up 17%. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.25 versus $0.60 a year ago and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.63 versus $2.20 last year, up 20%.Turning to our business segments. Small Business and Self-Employed group revenue grew 18% during the quarter, driven by online ecosystem revenue, which grew 21%. Our results continue to demonstrate the power of our small business platform and the mission-critical nature of our offerings, which resonates with customers as they look to grow their business and improve cash flow in any economic environment.With the goal of being the source of crude for small businesses, our strategic focus within the small business and self-employed group is threefold: grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. Good Books Online accounting revenue grew 19% in Q2, driven mainly by customer growth, higher effective prices and mix shift. We continue to prioritize disrupting the small business mid-market through continued focus on both go-to-market and product innovations.While mid-market customers are a smaller subset of the total small business TAM that drive a higher ARPC over time given their more complex needs and higher usage of services across our platform. This, coupled with our strategy to sell more of our ecosystem services to existing customers shift the emphasis in our growth formula towards ARPC over time.Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue grew 24% in Q2, driven by payroll, payments, Mailchimp capital and time tracking. Within payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects an increase in customers adopting our Pro solutions, higher effective prices and a mix shift towards higher-end offerings.Within payments, the revenue growth for the quarter reflects ongoing customer growth as more customers adopt our payment offerings to manage their cash flow, higher effective prices and an increase in total payment volume for our customer. Mailchimp revenue growth was driven by higher effective prices and paid customer growth.Third, we continue to make progress expanding globally by executing our refreshed international strategy, which includes leading with both QuickBooks Online and Mailchimp in our established markets, and leading with Mailchimp in all other markets as we continue to execute on localized product and lineup. On a constant currency basis, total international online ecosystem revenue grew 16% in Q2.Now moving to our desktop ecosystem. Desktop ecosystem revenue grew 10% in the second quarter, and QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew in the mid-teens. We are more than 2 years into a 3-year transition for customers that remain on a license-based desktop offering to a recurring subscription model.In fiscal 2025, the tailwinds from the 3-year transition will be behind us, but we expect our Desktop Enterprise offering, which accounts for over half of desktop accounting revenue to grow in the high single-digit range. We also will continue to encourage remaining desktops subscription customers who tend to be more complex and higher value to migrate seamlessly to either QuickBooks Online or our desktop enterprise offering when they are ready. Additionally, we see opportunities to continue to price the product for value. The online ecosystem remains a growth catalyst longer term.Shifting to our consumer and ProTax groups. Our full year outlook remains unchanged, even though Consumer Group revenue declined 5% in the quarter, reflecting an approximately 1 week later IRS opened this year. We are confident in our game plan to winter season and are reiterating our guidance for Consumer group of 7% to 8% revenue growth in fiscal 2024.Turning to the ProTax group. Revenue grew 8% to $274 million in Q2, reflecting the timing of when tax forms were delivered, which is a driver for revenue recognition.Moving to Credit Karma. Credit Karma delivered revenue of $375 million in Q2, flat to a year ago, primarily reflecting growth in credit card money, credit cards and auto loans offset by decline in home loans, personal loans and auto insurance. We saw select partners taking a conservative approach to extending credit in both personal loans and credit cards in Q2, reflecting expected macro trends.And as a reminder, Q2 is typically the seasonally weakest quarter of the year. We expect Q3 to benefit from additional Credit Karma money revenue during tax season. In summary, I am pleased with our continued momentum this fiscal year.Now shifting to our balance sheet and capital allocation. Our financial principles guide our decisions. They remain our long-term commitment and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with $1.5 billion in cash and investments and $6 billion in debt on our balance sheet.We repurchased $536 million of stock during the second quarter. Depending on our market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share, payable on April 18, 2024. This represents a 15% increase versus last year.Moving on to guidance. We are reaffirming our fiscal 2024 guidance. This includes total company revenue growth of 11% to 12%, GAAP operating income growth of 15% to 18%; non-GAAP operating income growth of 12% to 14%, GAAP earnings per share growth of 11% to 15% and non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 12% to 14%.Our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 includes revenue growth of 10% to 11%, GAAP earnings per share of $7.77 to $7.84, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $9.31 to $9.38. As a reminder, we are taking a prudent approach with guidance given the continued macroeconomic uncertainty. You can find our full year fiscal 2024 and Q3 guidance detailed in our press release and on our fact sheet.With that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan."", 'Sasan K. Goodarzi', ""Great. Thank you, Sandeep. And just to quickly wrap up, we're very confident in our AI-driven expert platform strategy, our progress with our 5 big bets and creating a future of done for you with a gateway to human expertise. We believe that this will change our relationship with our customers, becoming their trusted advisers, leading to higher engagement and monetization.The combination of our assets and our strategy creates a growth flywheel for Intuit to accelerate penetrating our $300 billion in TAM.With that, let's open it up to your questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho.', 'Sitikantha Panigrahi', ""Sasan and Sandeep, I want to dig into the health of the small business. Just a 2-part question. On the online accounting system, revenue seems to be in line our expectations side to decel. Is there any onetime factor that influence? And how should we think about second half, given that's an easy comp?And other part is on the services, while we're presently surprised is accelerated, and you talked about some of this payroll payments and Mailchimp, is there anything like you're doing differently, specifically drilling into a Mailchimp? How is that part of the business doing?"", 'Sasan K. Goodarzi', ""Yes, Siti. Maybe I'll start us off and Sandeep, please jump in as you wish. I mean the headline that I would give, Siti, is that we're really pleased with the momentum that we have, the growth that we've experienced.When you think about -- think about it in context of the current macro environment, we're continuing to see larger, higher-value customers, mid-market customers. I want to shift to digitization. And the more we spend time with them with our account managers, with our sales folks, with our customer success folks. They tend to have a tendency of wanting to move more of their services to us because for the most part, we are already the standard of financial management solutions that they use for their financial records but they see it as an opportunity to get paid faster, manage their workforce to be able to use our capabilities to be able to market to their customers.And so the net of it that I would leave you with is I like our momentum in this macro environment. We expect that to continue for the rest of the year. And there's a lot of puts and takes in our online accounting and online services. And so I wouldn't read anything into it.The most important element to take away is the 21% overall online growth. And our services are strong, and we continue to innovate with our services. And I expect that we'll continue to lead digitization and transformation for our small businesses. Sandeep, I don't know if you want to add anything, but those would be the headlines from me, Siti."", 'Sandeep Singh Aujla', ""Sasan covered it. Siti, what I would also remind you of is, as we've shared in the past, there are 3 imperatives that we focused on as a management team, new customer acquisition, driving adoption of our platform and being better together across our platform.And with that, a new customer acquisition, our team continues to focus on mid-market customers. As you quite mid-market customers, they're larger richer revenue pool. They have higher customer acquisition costs, but they also take a little longer to ramp up because most of the size of the pipe in those mid-market customers on services revenue, which ramps up as opposed to accounting, which you start booking as soon as they become a customer.So just a dynamic to keep in mind. That's why in my prepared remarks, I called out that our growth from -- will continue to start leaning more towards ARPC going forward. And the second component of the services is basically us executing on our focus on driving adoption of our platform."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs.', 'Kasthuri Gopalan Rangan', ""Congratulations to Sasan and Sandeep, really good call here. I'm wondering if you can give us an update on what's happening in the SMB market? It looks like enterprise spending seems to be stabilizing. I know that you're not really enterprise equipment advance.But how do you characterize the outlook for small businesses given that the economy is on stable footing, and we don't have the worries that we had growing it become the 2?"", 'Sasan K. Goodarzi', ""Kash, great to hear from you. Great question. I would -- let me categorize the answer in 2 buckets. First of all, facts are friendly, and let me start with the facts. We see across our base is that cash reserves are down 11% year-over-year. That's really what small businesses care about.But it's actually up 115% over pre-pandemic levels. And so the takeaway you should have in that is Small businesses are being challenged in this macro environment. Consumers are spending less dollars, but they're actually healthier an aggregate level than they were several years ago.In fact, what I would call out is the number of hours worked is higher this year several points compared to last year. So that just the strength of the work that they're doing, being able to have access to talent is in a better position for small businesses compared to last year.And that, by the way, as you can imagine, differs by country and by sector. Sectors like real estate IT spending is struggling, if the sector of small business is in, but things like professional services, auto repairs is actually quite healthy.Last thing I would end with is the higher-value customers, more the mid-market customers are healthier than those that are small and just starting out, which, by the way, we've seen this in our 20-plus years, right? We've seen this. This is a normal trend whereby the larger businesses have a lot more levers to be able to pull and they're generally healthier.Lastly, our view, and we're not economists, but we see a lot of data. Our view is that 2024 is going to be a lot of the same for small businesses. We don't believe that there's going to be any kind of an economic tailwind as we think about the next -- the rest of the calendar year."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank.', 'Brad Alan Zelnick', ""Maybe a tax question, just with the slower start to the season, Sasan, and we appreciate every season is more and more back-end loaded. But can you talk about what it is that you're seeing in the funnel and anything else that supports your confidence in the full year consumer guide?"", 'Sasan K. Goodarzi', ""Yes. Sure, Brad. First of all, I'll amplify what you started out with. Having been in the tax business and ran it more than 10 years ago and watching our trends in the last 10 years, every season, there's a push to a later start, and it's just a consumer behavior, and we're seeing that this year. So that's not anything unique.There's 2 things that I would call out that are strategic to us that are worth calling out because we see green shoots in both with the early part of season. One is full service. Just as a refresher, there's nearly 100 million consumers in small businesses that spend about $30 billion to have somebody else do their taxes for them. And we really leaned into our overall full service experience.We've really leaned into our campaigns, both on air, digital, very basic things, by the way, that we didn't use to have the capabilities of that we're now building, which is if you use an expert and you love that expert that you can recommend that expert to a friend.That's basic, but the infrastructure that we're building to really disrupt the full-service space is a necessity. And we feel very good about the green shoots that we're seeing both on the consumer front and on the business tax front. And I'll remind you that this is our first year leading all the way into business tax. So it's beyond early, but everything that we've seen just indicates that this is an enormous opportunity for us. So that's on the full service front.The second I would mention is Credit Karma. This is really an area where we have nearly 45 million monthly active users. They engage more than 5x a month, and the majority of those monthly active users actually use a different method and not TurboTax. And so we've really heavily invested in the experience, whether you want to do it yourself in the app or you want us to do it for you, which is full service and compelling offerings that we've been testing and scaling. And we also like the green shoots there.So those are the 2 things that I would call out, and it really positions us for share of spend. And I'll end with the following, which is we said the goal line in taxes, our share of total IRS returns. And really, what matters is the share of spend that we're getting and full service is essential for that, both this year and in the future."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo.', 'Michael James Turrin', ""I was hoping we could go back to the mix of online services, and maybe you could just help us compare and contrast in more detail what you're seeing from a growth perspective across the payroll payments and Mailchimp business.And is there a float aspect at all to the payroll portion of the business that might be helping reinforce some of the margin strength you're seeing given headwinds from the floats start to tax? I think a lot of focus on just the EPS strength in the quarter."", 'Sasan K. Goodarzi', 'Sure. Do you mind repeating the last part of your question?', 'Michael James Turrin', ""Yes. Just wondering if there's at all on the payroll side, a flow component that might be also just softly helping margin outside of the consumer headwinds you're seeing?"", 'Sasan K. Goodarzi', ""Yes. Let me start with the overall services question that you asked, and Sandeep will weigh in here with some of the facts that you asked around flow. I think the -- the thing that I would just say around services goes back to my earlier comment, which is we're just spending a lot more time with higher value customers, really helping them understand what we can do to digitize their businesses, and by the way, continuing to improve our offerings.And so as we talked about earlier, our total online payments growth this quarter was 20% in a fairly tough macro environment. That's because we continue to invest in making the experience easier providing multiple methods to get paid instant deposit, getting paid upfront. So those really help with, in essence, payments adoption.Our payroll adoption has been strong, particularly larger customers and with full service. We're continuing to really invest in some of the most important foundational elements with Mailchimp that higher-value customers are adopting, and particularly some of the things that I called out with Intuit Assist.It's really -- it's not 1 thing. It's a combination of all of our services and the focus on higher-value customers that is really helping us with some of the services adoption. Maybe Sandeep, I'll turn it over to you on the float and anything else you want to add?"", 'Sandeep Singh Aujla', ""Sure. Thanks, Sasan. Michael, the floor component is a very small part of our payroll business. As one thing said we really aim to due for our small businesses is to hold their cash as little as possible. So floor is not a big component for us.And I think -- the overarching theme of your question was the ability for Intuit is to preserve the earnings power of the company despite the 1 week delay in the IRS opening, I think Sasan touched on that. And it's also some of the great work that the team has been doing around acquiring larger customers around the line of work we did to make the higher end SKUs in payroll more attractive to those customers, the work the team is doing around mid-market account management in Mailchimp. So its a plethora of activities that continues to give us confidence across our portfolio of assets that we have here at Intuit."", 'Operator', 'Next question comes from Taylor McGinnis with UBS.', 'Taylor Anne McGinnis', 'Maybe another one on online services. So if I heard you correctly earlier, it sounds like you guys are expecting a more stable macro environment as we move throughout the year. So can you just talk about what that means for the durability of the acceleration in online services that we just saw, the 24% year-over-year?Could you actually see online services hanging here at these levels? Is there anything onetime in nature? And just curious, as the macro remains more challenging, how the pricing lever could be used there to help you guys during this time?', 'Sasan K. Goodarzi', ""Yes. Sure, Taylor, let me add a few things, if I could. First of all, I'll start with we don't view the macro environment as entirely remaining stable. We think it's going to continue to be uncertain. So we're not sort of banking on any of our growth coming from any type of a tailwind from the macro environment.We think '24 will be somewhat choppy like '23 was from a macro environment perspective. And we see it in the consumer credit scores of consumers. As you know, we see over 100 million members across Credit Karma and their credit scores in the last couple of years are down almost 20 points. Gen Z credit card balances are up over 60%. And those are just a couple of illustrative examples that consumers are strained.So the first uber point would be that we think the environment is stable to uncertain, and we're not trying to outguess the economy but really focus on our customers and our innovation, which gets to the second point.And that is we have confidence in the guidance that we provided of the 16% to 17% for the year, even in context of the macro environment, just because we continue to really emphasize and focus with our high-value mid-market customers digitization. And that's really what's leading to our overall 21% online growth that we talked about.And that's what gives us confidence in our guidance. And really, as we look into the future, our entire focus is really all about our innovation and our go-to-market to win despite the comp economic environment."", 'Sandeep Singh Aujla', ""And the one thing I would add, and just to build on Sasan's point, you asked a question around pricing, pricing power. Our tenant around pricing is around the offerings -- the power of offerings and the innovation we're building into the offerings. And the perceived actual value that we're delivering to our customers is not related to the macro environment. So that's another point I just wanted to emphasize in terms of how we think about our pricing."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research.', 'Aleksandr J. Zukin', ""Congrats on the quarter. Sasan, maybe a AI question for you. Clearly, it's something that continues to really evolve and become a core part and parcel of the company, both on the SMB side and the consumer side.I wanted to ask, if you look at the coming tax season on the consumer side, how do you expect to see the benefit of some of the assist functionality? Is it more converting kind of free to pay? Is it pay to pay more?And then similarly, on both Credit Karma and on the SMB side, if you think about the progression of the year, kind of where are you seeing the biggest opportunities as you start to see the interactions build on the platform?"", 'Sasan K. Goodarzi', 'Yes, Alex, great question. Let me start with 1 headline, particularly as we\'ve been in beta or with certain capabilities at scale and GA. I\'ll start with the headline, which is we believe that over time, and I want to emphasize the overtime piece, that this is going to create an entirely new category of experiences and growth that is not even possible today because of truly creating a set of experiences where the work is done for customers, and there\'s always a gateway to a human expert that\'s all AI-powered.And the more we\'re in market, the more we\'re learning, adjusting, adapting the more we are convinced that we\'re going to be able to create a new category of services and what\'s possible to penetrate our $300 million in TAM. Now with that said, let me get real specific and sort of real tactical.The second headline news that I would give is none of the work that we\'re doing with Intuit Assist, which is really about what we\'re doing across the platform. It\'s not a feature. None of it is in our results today, and we\'re not counting on it to be in our results in the near future.But with that said, to answer your question as to impact to start with, there\'s a couple of areas where it will have a profound impact. One is full service. And the profound impact, by the way, is from the investments that we\'ve made in the last 5 years.I mean to do what we\'re doing in full service at scale and think about it, it\'s really based on data, AI, ecosystem of apps because now we can do your taxes through Credit Karma through the QuickBooks platform, and 1 of the largest networks of experts that we have.And all of that fits on machine learning, knowledge engineering and now Gen AI capability. So the biggest in our view, based on what we\'re seeing in market, right, the biggest opportunity is about the ease and the speed of getting people\'s taxes done.So imagine a world where you\'re a full-service customer that we can get your taxes done an less than an hour, maximum refund and extend your dollars because of what we can do with you on the Credit Karma platform. an excellent service. The best service you can imagine in the world, which, by the way, is supported by our product recommendation score of 88.So really, it\'s full service that will have the biggest impact. Now the whole underlying platform is what full service uses. And so the other is, over time, yes, it will help with conversion, and really, it\'s about confidence.And we\'re seeing that right now where Intuit Assist is engaged to understand my tax outcome and refund outcome, the helpful rating is 1.5x better than we\'ve ever seen. And by the way, we are very early. We haven\'t perfected it by any means. So that\'s on the tax front.Just very quickly, let me touch on Credit Karma. As you know, 1 of the powers of Credit Karma on behalf of our customers is we know everything about the customer. We know all the data and leverage AI to deliver personalized credit cards that are right for them or personal loans, whatever it may be.One thing that\'s profound with GenAI that we\'re learning and seeing in market today is now customers can interact with Credit Karma, whereas before they could the front too is the promise, I would show you the 3 credit cards that are right for you based on everything that I know about you.But now you can interact with Credit Karma and ask, ""Hey, I\'m looking for travel rewards, which of these 3 credit cards are the best for me?"" And then we interact with you and help you understand which 1 is the best for you based on an additional set of questions that you\'ve asked where we now know more about. That\'s profound because that will, over time, drive higher engagement, monetization, et cetera.And on the small business front, our entire focus is revenue and profitability increase. Everything that we are testing in market, learning in market is so that we can help you with campaigns that increases your revenue or manage our cash flow that better helps you with profitability.And one of the things we\'re testing with is to have experts that actually provide insights to you. And those insights could be, hey, it\'s time to take out capital because your sales are strong or I just finished doing your books for you. Would you like to have a conversation so you can understand your cash flow and how your book is close for the month. And that\'s a monetizable event for us.So probably a longer answer that you\'re looking for, but those are the things that are in market where we\'re learning and adjusting. And we think over time, we haven\'t perfected any of this yet because it\'s actually hard, but we believe it will create an entirely new category of services and growth.', 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.', 'Kirk Materne', 'Yes. Congrats on the quarter. Sasan, can you just remind us where we are in terms of some of the cross-sell of QuickBooks into the Mailchimp base and vice versa. And when Intuit Assist goes GA for QuickBooks, will that be the point at which Intuit can answer questions across sort of the front office and back office for customers? Can you just talk about that a little bit?', 'Sasan K. Goodarzi', ""Yes. Great question, Kirk. Let me start with your -- the Intuit Assist question first. And I'll sequence -- I'll share with you how we're sequencing it. Right now, our entire focus -- and remember, everything that we are doing here is based on data and AI. A lot of our investments are what we don't see, which is ensuring that the data is usable, that it's clean, that is structured the right way and that our machine learning, knowledge engineering and GenAI capabilities can digest all of the data.Inclusive of data, by the way, that's contributed by the customer like access to their Gmail account, access to their Excel spreadsheet because a lot of customers' data are in those 2 places or they're in shoe boxes and being able to take pictures and for us to be able to digest that data and actually deliver insights.So our first priority of order is to ensure that if you're using our small business platform and if you are looking to put together marketing campaigns that Intuit Assist is doing that for you.The second element of what we are focused on is then being able to transfer and use Intuit across QuickBooks and Mailchimp because all the data points are connected. That is absolutely where we are headed, and it's sequenced in second place compared to what I just articulated because we have to nail the basics.But that's actually where the power of our platform will show off to our customers where whether you're in Credit Karma or TurboTax, you can ask whatever question you want that is relevant in your life, and we can answer it because all of our data points are connected and our AI capabilities are, in essence, working across the products. So that is sequence, but we're working on that as we speak.The second is cross-sell. First of all, I'll start with -- we're not thinking about it in terms of cross-sell. We're thinking about it in terms of product integration. So what we are really focused on. And this is, by the way, this applies to TurboTax and Credit Karma this applies to Mailchimp and QuickBooks.What we're really focused on is integrating the product at moment of truth that matters most based on how the customer does the work. Like, for instance, if you are in QuickBooks on your left map, this is just an illustrative example because we're actually testing a lot of this is that you can actually see how you can manage your customers and put together marketing campaigns.And when you engage and click on that, you have the Mailchimp engine that is working behind the scenes and after maybe a couple of free trials then we share with you how much it is to pay for these capabilities. So that's what I mean by product integration. We want to nail the benefits at the moment of truth that matters versus just trying to sell you Mailchimp within the platform. We found over time that, that's not as effective. What's most effective is the product integration. So that's the approach that we're taking across all of our platforms."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies.', 'Brent John Thill', ""Jason, for Credit Karma to get back to growth, what are the key ingredients that you need to see for that to get back to growth versus the declines that we've seen the last year?"", 'Sasan K. Goodarzi', ""Yes, good question. A couple of things. One, which we are starting to see, which is just stability of partners and the environment, for the most part, other than some select partners, we've actually seen stability with our partners, and we've actually seen verticals like insurance come back. We saw a big decline last year.So one is just stability. And then the second is just the areas of innovation that we are focused on. One is we've redesigned the entire app. Now it's rolled out to all members, which is a massive, massive feet. And based on the redesign of the app, there are many ways in which we can engage customers more so than we could before, and that will actually drive monetization. So that's 1 lever beyond the macro that I mentioned.The second is Intuit Assist. It's the example I provided earlier, where now customers can actually interact with us and ask questions and let us know what's important to them, but we can personalize things in a way that we could never before. And based on very early testing, we see the engagement is higher when customers are interacting with Intuit Assist, which over time will lead to monetization. That's the second area.Third is just a number of initiatives that we have around Prime. As I've mentioned, as we've mentioned before, Prime is actually quite a large part of our monthly active users, but we've never really focused on it. Now that's an area of focus.And then last but not least is TurboTax. And TurboTax, the way we're thinking about it is actually about product integration because the more we can engage members year round around if they took out a mortgage or having them take a snapshot of their W-2 and letting them know what their refund could be, the more we can actually penetrate more of the members to use TurboTax as a method to get their access to the refund. All those things, creating 1 platform is what we believe and are confident actually that will get us to accelerated growth, and it's really in that order. So let me pause there. Hopefully that helps, Brad."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from James Friedman with Susquehanna.', 'James Eric Friedman', 'I was hoping to get your thoughts on the opportunity for additional build pay options. I believe, Sasan, you mentioned in your prepared remarks rolling out same-day ACH. But any high-level thoughts on other bill pay options, including virtual credit cards?', 'Sasan K. Goodarzi', ""Yes. First of all, the key to success for us, given where we are on the rollout is one, network connections. And as you heard in our remarks, albeit very early, the number of business network connections has doubled since August.And that's important because it helps. It's a huge step forward to then digitize how we, in essence, help customers get take and pay bills.The second is just -- it's executing on our road map. The big thing that we're starting to roll out that we talked about earlier, is just faster payments, and that's through both paid ACH next day that we're rolling out and also batch payments.And so we're going to continue to look at what's most important for our customers, and that's what's informing our road map, but we have to do it in conjunction with continuing to increase network connections. And we're really excited about in the long term, what's possible, digitizing all of B2B because it's very -- it's incredibly beneficial to our customers because they get paid faster. And two, it's really a sticky product."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.', 'Raimo Lenschow', ""A question for Sandeep. As you think about this year, you kind of said that you didn't expect a lot of kind of recovery to health. It's just like how you manage the business. But if you think about costs, so far, you've been doing really well on margins.But there's also obviously an element of getting ready for things are getting better. How do you see the progression of investments this year?"", 'Sandeep Singh Aujla', ""Raimo, super important one. And let me share some of my thoughts. First and foremost, I'll start with the fact that we're deliberately building this business to scale growth while increasing our profitability. In fact, those are principal ones and two of our financial principles that we use to manage this company. So that's a very deliberate approach that we are taking.And we have a track record of spending margin over the years while bringing innovation to markets such as Intuit Assist, such as building innovation to address the opportunity we have in the mid-market, such as innovation to localized product in milling for the international market. So we are not leaving growth opportunities on the table with our focus to scale growth and drive innovation.Now to the second point of your question in terms of the profitability profile so far this year, we look at our margins and aim to deliver our margin commitments for the full year, and I feel quite confident in our path to do so. And the performance we had in the first couple of quarters, in fact, boosted the confidence that I have in our full year guidance."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.', 'Mark Ronald Murphy', ""So Sasan, within the QuickBooks business, you have this growth vector in the upmarket piece. And I'm curious if you're able to comment on the growth and traction that you're seeing in that 10 to 100 employee segment versus the 1 to 9 or 0 to 9 employee segment.For instance, is one of those growing mid-20s and the other is high teens? Just interested in how much of a spread you see there and maybe where you see it trending this year."", 'Sasan K. Goodarzi', ""Yes, sure. I'll add a perspective and would invite Sandeep to chime in as well. I think the short answer is we are seeing more traction in our higher-value customers and our mid-market customers, which I think to your frame is 10, 15 employees and up or more, higher revenue customers.We are seeing more traction there, and more momentum there. And by the way, A big part of it is that's where we're really focusing our innovation, our go-to-market. At the same time, to be clear, we are -- we always remain paranoid and always believe in the notion of disrupting from the low end, which is, by the way, why we just launched the solopreneur offering, which is to be able to serve those small businesses that, in essence, they're on their own because we believe that is helping entrepreneurs when they're a team of 1 because 1 day, some will become a team of thousands.So we're not taking our eye off the ball on the low end at all, but we're doubling down on our focus on the higher-value customers. And yes, we do see more resiliency, more momentum with these larger customers."", 'Mark Ronald Murphy', ""And Sasan, cover the topic. The only thing I would add is that the unit economics on the upmarket is also something that we find quite attractive to these customers. They tend to scale to a much higher ARPC, especially as we get them to adopt our platform. They, by definition, have more employees. They have a definition of processing more payments. So that's also something that we find attractive and is very much an area that we are having our go-to-market teams and our product teams deliberately lead in this year."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Steve Enders with Citi.', 'Steven Lester Enders', 'Okay. Great. I guess maybe just on the SMB side again. I think you made a comment in the prepared remarks about shifting towards ARPC over time as a growth lever. Just I guess one I want to clarify that comment.And then secondarily, does that change how you think about the levers of growth moving forward for the SMB segment from more towards ARPC away from the customer side?', 'Sandeep Singh Aujla', ""Steve, the way we think about it and as we were just addressing in the prior question, we see a tremendous opportunity in the mid-market for those that we currently define as having 10 to 100 employees.And what really excites us about this opportunity is that these customers come with a much higher lifetime value, much higher ARPC and have better retention. And so that just helps our economics. But these customers also tend to have higher customer acquisition costs. So -- and they are relatively fewer of those than the smaller customers just by definition, when you look at the overall addressable market.So as we focus on these larger customers, they -- that means we will get higher ARPC customer even though there are fewer of those. So that is where the growth formula continue to abide by the growth format that we have publicly discussed about 10% to 20% customer growth, 10% to 20% ARPC growth, whereas we continue to focus on the mid-market, you should expect us to lean in more towards the ARPC growth because of this dynamic with the mid-market. And we think that's actually a good thing for the business going forward."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.', 'Scott Andrew Schneeberger', ""Sasan, a couple of tax questions. One, just here's a -- we're 3 weeks in, we're pretty well through the early season. you had anticipated earlier before the tax season that we would see a probably flattish year for the industry. And that felt kind of conservative.Now that we're in a bit -- and we've also seen a return to DIY category shift. I'm curious if you have any update on what you're seeing for the industry overall thus far? And then the second part is, on full service, you sound very happy with it, the 88 number recommendation score.Could you speak to some of the growing pain points you had last year and the fixes you're seeing this year as you're working your way through the early season?"", 'Sasan K. Goodarzi', ""Yes, sure. Our view, having been through however many tax seasons we've been through as a company is -- it's early in the season to estimate how many folks will ultimately file when it's all said and done.With that said, our belief is still the same. It will probably be total of number of filers will probably be flattish, maybe up a little bit. Our perspective really hasn't changed because our focus is how do we win as many filers within the categories that are growing to file.But so the first answer is our view hasn't really changed. The second on full service and some of the growing pains, I would call out a few from last year compared to what we're doing this year. One is we actually made it difficult for customers to get into full service last year.And by the way, it was more time to ensure that customers were really, really getting into the right service. But we had so much friction that we had created upfront. And if you think about somebody that just walked into somebody's home or office and sort of hands everything over and says here, get my taxes done and then they interact until 3, 4 weeks later until their taxes are done.The notion of engaging and putting a lot of friction up and asking a lot of questions upfront is not a behavior they're used to. So that was big learning and growing pain, a lot of which we have removed all the friction and engage -- get a customer to engage an expert depending on what we know about them very, very early. So that's one.I think the second one, we learned a lot about what did and did not work in our campaigns last year. And there's a lot we are doing differently to really help customers, both on air digitally, but also the infrastructure that we are working on, which by the way, is not going to be done this season, right?We're going to be investing in it for several years where basic things, which by the way, are very powerful, where if I did your taxes and you love the work that I did for you. And by the way, our product recommendation score of 88 would suggest that our expert to deliver excellent service, you'd want to recommend me to your friend.Well, last year, you could not do that. And this year, we're building the capabilities so you can actually recommend me to our friend. And that virality is a very big thing, especially when you have an 88 product recommendation score. And then lastly is 43% of those that use an assisted method that choose the switch to somebody else, 43% will actually go on Google, and Google, is there a TaxPro near me? And again, that's another example of where we didn't have the infrastructure to show up. And we're building that infrastructure. So I can tell you for a fact in San Jose, California, right, or in Los Gatos, I should say, if you put in TaxPro near me, we will show up top of the list, we being TurboTax. If you do it in Atlanta, which is where I was a few weeks ago, we don't show up. It's because we're working on it.And so that's an example of the things that we learned last year that we're implementing this year, but not just for this tax season, but really to nail it with excellence as we think about the future."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.', 'Keith Weiss', ""Excellent. Just one for Sandeep as well. Another margin question but a little bit of a different angle. When it comes to generative AI, we're really been talking a lot about the potential top line impact. Are there operating margin benefits that you guys can see through just better usage of the gen AI technology internally, whether it's stuff like code assist or whatnot?And then on the flip side of the equation, given that a lot of this stuff is still ramping up, is there anything we should be looking out for on the gross margin line in terms of just like these capabilities being that much more compute-intensive and that much more impactful on COGS versus what you're seeing in consensus estimates today?"", 'Sandeep Singh Aujla', ""Keith, so let me start by just reminding us all that the GenAI cost for the current fiscal year have been incorporated into our guidance. So that's first and foremost, but now let me address the themes of your question.As I think about the cost structure and outlook from the cost return where your question was, we actually feel that we are quite advantageous versus the market in the sense that the data that we have, that we have touched on that's residing behind our firewalls that we are training our large language models on that are delivering more contextually relevant answers at a faster speed versus other generally available large language models and that they are doing that at a fraction of the cost.So just from a unit economics point of view for the GenAI it's actually advantageous the way we are running it. Two, we don't have our own data center, and we rely on AWS and other third-party data centers to run our model. So that, again, is a cost advantage because we don't have the build-out cost as some others might have.Furthermore, as I look across our business, I do see opportunities for us to, over time, improve our economics using GenAI and AI. We've already given examples on things such as in customer success, where agents no longer have to take notes or spend minutes summarizing the call that they just had, AI does that.And that's just one small example. But I expect that to continue to lead to more efficiencies in our customer success call lead to more better unit economics in a full service and live offerings. And as we kind of carry that forward also how we are staffing our service in terms of project management or designers to engineers ratios. I see many opportunities for us to continue to benefit from Gen AI, and I feel good about the early start that we have leading into some of those capabilities."", 'Keith Weiss', 'Got it. So net-net, it seems like a positive dynamic versus something that could drag on margins overall?', 'Sandeep Singh Aujla', 'That would be the right takeaway. Yes.', 'Operator', ""Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's question-and-answer period.

In the \'long\' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock\'s price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.', 'While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.', 'Below, we take a look at DaVita HealthCare (DVA), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.', ""It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. DaVita HealthCare currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).

It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area."", ""For DVA, shares are up 11.25% over the past week while the Zacks Medical - Outpatient and Home Healthcare industry is up 0.46% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 14.37% compares favorably with the industry's 0.21% performance as well."", 'Considering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Over the past quarter, shares of DaVita HealthCare have risen 21.1%, and are up 48.27% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 12.01% and 29.12%, respectively.', ""Investors should also pay attention to DVA's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. DVA is currently averaging 965,473 shares for the last 20 days."", 'Earnings Outlook', 'The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with DVA.', ""Over the past two months, 3 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost DVA's consensus estimate, increasing from $8.46 to $8.97 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period."", 'Bottom Line', ""Taking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that DVA is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep DaVita HealthCare on your short list."", 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Thus, you can purchase Whirlpool's shares before the 29th of February in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 15th of March."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.75 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$7.00 to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that Whirlpool has a trailing yield of 6.3% on the current share price of US$110.56. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. As a result, readers should always check whether Whirlpool has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Whirlpool ', ""Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Its dividend payout ratio is 80% of profit, which means the company is paying out a majority of its earnings. The relatively limited profit reinvestment could slow the rate of future earnings growth. We'd be worried about the risk of a drop in earnings. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. The company paid out 105% of its free cash flow over the last year, which we think is outside the ideal range for most businesses. Cash flows are usually much more volatile than earnings, so this could be a temporary effect - but we'd generally want to look more closely here."", ""While Whirlpool's dividends were covered by the company's reported profits, cash is somewhat more important, so it's not great to see that the company didn't generate enough cash to pay its dividend. Cash is king, as they say, and were Whirlpool to repeatedly pay dividends that aren't well covered by cashflow, we would consider this a warning sign."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Businesses with shrinking earnings are tricky from a dividend perspective. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. Whirlpool's earnings have collapsed faster than Wile E Coyote's schemes to trap the Road Runner; down a tremendous 31% a year over the past five years."", ""Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, Whirlpool has lifted its dividend by approximately 11% a year on average. The only way to pay higher dividends when earnings are shrinking is either to pay out a larger percentage of profits, spend cash from the balance sheet, or borrow the money.

After years of strong and predictable gains, many companies have seen their stocks fall out of favor with investors.', 'This can be due to a number of factors. Slowing sales, dwindling profits, loss of market share, and failure to keep up with shifting tides can all lead to once mighty stocks falling on hard times. While many securities are still down for the count, some are getting up off the mat and look ready to fight their way back into the good graces of investors. After declining and then languishing for long periods, certain stocks seem to have finally bottomed and are marching higher once again.', 'For shareholders who held on and kept the faith, this is a moment of vindication.

The sale made headlines as Buffett has long been Apple’s self-proclaimed biggest fan, and the company’s largest individual shareholder. Berkshire Hathaway currently holds a little more than 905 million shares of Apple worth $165 billion.', 'While Apple continues to be Buffett’s biggest position, comprising nearly half (45%) of his stock portfolio, the sale late last year is further evidence of the poor sentiment surrounding AAPL stock. The ill will is reflected in the fact that Apple’s share price is down 2% year to date (YTD). Declining sales of its legacy devices, such as the iPhone, are the main reason the stock is down. However, there’s reason to believe Apple’s stock is ready to rise as the company introduces its Vision Pro augmented reality (AR) headset.', 'The Vision Pro is Apple’s first entirely new device since the Apple Watch was introduced in 2015, and should help to boost the company’s finances and share price. Additionally, early reviews of the Vision Pro are positive.', 'Source: chrisdorney / Shutterstock', 'Recently, Walt Disney Co.

DIS stock is now up 23% on the year and trading at a 52-week high. It’s a big turnaround after the share price languished at a multi-year low for most of 2023.', 'Further, the reversal of fortune comes after Disney reported better-than-expected Q4 financial results. Also, it increased its dividend payment to shareholders by 50%. Starting this July, Disney will pay a semi-annual dividend to stockholders of 45 cents. That’s a whopping 50% higher than its current payout. Walt Disney reinstated its dividend late last year after suspending it in 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic. If that weren’t enough, Disney also announced a new $3 billion stock buyback plan. Investors are loving it.', 'Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com', 'For 20 years, General Electric (NYSE:GE) was viewed as a value trap. From the late 1990s through to the pandemic in 2020, GE stock consistently slid downwards.

Currently, GE stock is up 18% on the year and has gained 75% in the last 12 months due to a remarkable turnaround at the industrial conglomerate.', 'At the end of January, General Electric reported Q4 2023 financial results that beat Wall Street forecasts across the board. Also, the company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $1.03, which was higher than the 91 cents consensus estimate of analysts. Revenue in Q4 rose 15% to $19.42 billion, beating forecasts of $17.67 billion. GE said the strong print was due to demand for parts and services at its jet engine business.', 'Much of the turnaround has come from the company separating its diverse business units.

Thus, the insurer is making investments in various strategic initiatives, both organic and inorganic, that paved the way for long-term growth. Apart from strengthening its traditional core package, Chubb continues to build on specialty products.Better pricing, business growth and high renewal rates along with these positives, should help it continue its effective capital deployment.Chubb has a strong capital position with sufficient cash-generation capabilities. Its underwriting and investment performance provide strong support to operating cash flow. Riding on a strong capital position, Chubb also buys back shares apart from paying dividends. The insurer bought back $2.48 billion worth of shares in 2023.Chubb’s return on equity — a profitability measure of how prudently the company is utilizing its shareholders’ funds — stands at 16.5%, higher than the industry’s average of 7.2%.

Reported EPS is $0.84, expectations were $0.75. LKQ Corporation isn’t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).', ""Operator: Hello, and welcome to today's LKQ Corporation Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Jordan and I will be coordinating your call today. [Operator Instructions]. I’m now going to hand over to Joe Boutross, Vice President of Investor Relations, LKQ Corporation. Joe, please go ahead."", ""Joe Boutross: Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to LKQ's fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings conference call. With us today are Nick Zarcone, LKQ's President and Chief Executive Officer; Rick Galloway, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Justin Jude, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Please refer to the LKQ website at lkqcorp.com for our earnings release issued this morning as well as the accompanying slide presentation for this call. Now, let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors."", ""We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to the Risk Factors discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release and slide presentation. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K, which we filed with the SEC earlier today. And as normal, we are planning to file our 10-K in the coming days. And with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Nick Zarcone."", ""Nick Zarcone: Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everybody on the call. As many of you know, in late November, we announced my intention to retire as CEO effective June 30, 2024, and that the Board unanimously selected Justin as my successor following an intensive planning process that had been initiated well over a year ago. In the interim, Justin is serving as our Global Chief Operating Officer and I look forward to working with him and our segment teams to ensure the continuation of our operational excellence program that we started late in 2018. Nowhere has this program been more evident than in our Wholesale North America segment, which under Justin's direction has significantly expanded margins, improved cash flow, all while enhancing our leading market position."", ""Time and again, Justin has proven himself as both a strong operating executive and an effective leader who definitively embodies LKQ's values. It is a pleasure having Justin on the call today in his well-deserved new role. I'm going to start by providing some high-level comments related to our performance in the quarter and the full year 2023, followed by Rick who will dive into the financial details and discuss our 2024 guidance. And then, Justin, will provide some initial thoughts and commentary on our businesses, the path forward, and an update on our Uni-Select integration. Let me start with what LKQ accomplished in the last year, a year where operational excellence remained at the forefront of our efforts as we look to drive organic revenue growth, productivity, and excellent free cash flow."", ""I am proud to say that the LKQ team delivered. Here are some of the 2023 accomplishments worth noting. LKQ delivered strong full year organic revenue growth for parts and services of 4.7% on a reported basis and 5.1% on a per day basis. In February, we announced the highly synergistic Uni-Select acquisition and closed the transaction on August 1. We used our free cash flow to begin paying down debt as we strive to reduce our total leverage ratio to 2.0x. We're well on our way with net debt pay downs of over $375 million since the transaction closing, and the total leverage ratio at year-end was just 2.3x. We returned about $300 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and increased a quarterly amount by 9% in October. We also continued our share repurchase program with a $38 million outlay during the year of which $30 million was completed in fourth quarter."", 'And finally, we sustained a positive momentum in terms of cash flow generation, with free cash flow of approximately $1 billion in 2023. This represents the fourth consecutive year at or above $1 billion, and the 2023 results reflect a solid conversion ratio of 59% of adjusted EBITDA. Now on to the quarterly results. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $3.5 billion, an increase of 16.6% as compared to $3 billion for the fourth quarter of 2022. Parts and services organic revenue increased 2.8% on a reported basis and 3.4% on a per day basis. Foreign exchange rates increased revenue by 2.7% and the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures increased revenue by 13.1% year-over-year, for a total parts and services revenue increase of 18.7%.', ""Other revenue fell 16.4%, primarily due to weaker precious metal prices relative to the same period in 2022. Let's turn to some of the quarterly segment highlights. Organic revenue for parts and services for our North America segment increased 5.3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. We continue to perform well in North America, especially when you consider that according to CCC, collision and liability related auto claims were down 7.9% year-over-year. We believe the significant outperformance is due to several factors, including an industry-wide increase in alternative part usage, or APU, which was in part driven by the continued progress of the State Farm rollout, the remaining positive impact of the UAW strikes, and lastly, LKQ continuing to take market share."", 'The upward trend in our aftermarket volumes and the ongoing improvement in our order fill rates continued with fill rates reaching close to 95% in the fourth quarter, the highest level in 2023. As the supply chain recovered and fill rates increased, APU trended in our favor, particularly when looking at vehicles in our sweet spot. While total APU was about 36% in 2023, when looking at vehicles four to six old, it was approximately 40% and for vehicles more than seven years old, it was 51.6%. Both results represent meaningful increases over the 2022 levels. The aging car park will increase demand for the types of parts we sell into the collision repair industry. The salvage business had solid organic growth largely driven by volume. Total loss rates increased a bit in 2023 to 20.8%, but as you can see, it had no impact on our organic growth.', 'Importantly, the increase in total loss rates is largely being driven by vehicles 10 years and older, which is a population of vehicles at the very tail end of our sweet spot. For perspective, today, the average model year of a vehicle being repaired in a collision bay is a 2017 model, with the total loss rate for that cohort of vehicles being just 18.4% in 2023. That further supports our thesis that total loss rates will not materially impact our growth. Industry experts believe the total loss rate will edge down a bit in 2024. As we have always stated, fluctuations in total loss rates are largely net neutral events for LKQ. During the quarter, we realized a slight revenue uplift from the UAW strikes, which has now leveled off and no further benefit is expected.', 'Moving to our European segment. Europe organic revenue for parts and services in the quarter increased 3.9% on a reported basis and 5.1% on a per day basis. All the regions produced solid organic growth in the quarter with a particularly strong performance in the Benelux and Eastern European markets, as well as with our private label and salvage product lines. During the fourth quarter, our operations in Germany were again impacted by employee strikes at our large distribution center in Bavaria, while the ongoing discussions and negotiations between the works council and employers association continued. Throughout this process, our European team has worked diligently to mitigate the day-to-day impact of the strikes and their efforts have begun to offset some of the challenges that have impacted our German operations.', ""Although the strikes continue, we have been able to temporarily add some short-term capacity to operate our business and service our customers. Additionally, to foster a resolution, we recently initiated an incremental and unique approach and proposed terms of an LKQ-only offer to the works council. We have also commuted those terms to our employees and are cautiously optimistic that we are making positive progress towards a resolution. Rick will provide you with the financial impact shortly. Now, let's move on to our Specialty segment. During the fourth quarter, Specialty reported a decrease in organic revenue of 7%, which was under our expectations. Specialty again confronted headwinds specific to RV and towing products. Within the RV space, RV wholesale shipments of new units from the OEs to the dealers ended 2023 on a positive note with an increase of 8.1% in December."", 'This was the second consecutive month of year-over-year growth. Full year shipments, however, were down 36.5%. The general sense in the industry is that the RV headwinds have bottomed out, but we are not yet out of the woods as the dealers are still reluctant to fully restock accessories until they see the demand for new units increase. Truck accessories were also under some pressure in the quarter due to the drop in new vehicle production specific to the pickup and jeep categories, while marine and off-road product lines generated positive growth. Now to our Self Service segment. Organic revenue for parts and services for our Self Service segment decreased 5.6% in the fourth quarter. Self Service was again challenged by soft commodity pricing as seen in the other revenue decline, which impacted our expectations.', 'The soft precious metal prices have continued into 2024 and in the short-term, we expect little relief from commodities as we have modeled accordingly. Briefly on the Red Sea crisis, as far as we can predict, there will be minimal impact on parts availability in our key segments. In Europe, our procurement team is seeing some disruption with the shipping lines having to divert their vessels via the Cape of Good Hope around South Africa increasing lead times and freight costs. The freight cost is expected to soften once the Chinese New Year four weeks from mid-January ends. As one would expect, if the crisis persists, then we will potentially witness an increase in freight cost. Our supply chain team is taking precautionary measures by adding additional orders to address the extra lead times, especially with our private label product.', 'Lastly, on October 25 of 2023, as I mentioned on the last earnings call, we completed the divestment of GSF Car Parts formerly owned by Uni-Select. Since the GSF Car Parts business was held separately and never integrated into our business, we classified the business as discontinued operations upon acquisition. Before I turn over to Rick, who will run through the details of the segment results and discuss our outlook for 2024, I am pleased to announce that on February 20, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share of common stock that will be payable on March 28, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 14, 2024.', 'Rick Galloway: Thank you, Nick, and welcome to everyone joining us today. Before I address the fourth quarter, I would like to reflect on what LKQ accomplished throughout 2023. We were optimistic about our prospects going into 2023 despite macroeconomic challenges, inflation, and declining commodity prices. With our operational excellence focus and strong balance sheet, we concentrated on the things we could control and in those areas we were very pleased with our performance. We encountered headwinds that set back the overall profitability, but we believe many of these are transitory and will be minimal in 2024. The non-discretionary nature of the majority of our business and the resiliency of our industry allows us to perform well in almost any market environment.', 'Referring to the walk on Slide 4, I want to highlight the key year-over-year variances in our full year results. We reported diluted earnings per share of $3.51 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.83, the latter of which was $0.02 decrease relative to 2022. Our operational performance was a strong positive, delivering $0.27 year-over-year improvement with exceptional growth in North America partially offset by softness in precious metal prices and difficult market conditions impacting our Specialty and Self Service segments. Europe also contributed to the improvement with solid revenue growth and productivity benefits helping to offset the effects of the German strikes and the value-added tax matter in Italy. We benefited by $0.10 due to the lower share count resulting from our share repurchases in 2022.', 'We experienced year-over-year headwinds from market conditions, the most notable of which were $0.19 from the impact of metal prices as shown on Slide 28, and $0.13 in higher interest expense resulting from rate increases excluding Uni-Select costs. Acquisition and divestiture activities had a negative effect including $0.04 of dilution from the Uni-Select acquisition, important to note, this result was $0.01 better than we anticipated in our Q4 guidance and $0.02 of reduced earnings related to the PGW divestiture in April 2022. Foreign exchange rates were favorable on average in 2023, which contributed to $0.02 benefit. The tax provision represented a $0.06 benefit driven mostly by favorable impacts from discrete items. We have also included a fourth quarter EPS walk on Slide 5.', 'The main variances are similar to the full year drivers but with income taxes representing the largest variance from 2022. The 2023 provision included favorable discrete items and a slight full year effective rate reduction, while 2022 reflected a negative provision effect from increasing our full year effective rate and unfavorable discrete items. To expand on the operating performance for the quarter, I will provide additional detail on the segment results. Going to Slide 12, Wholesale North America continued its strong performance with a segment EBITDA margin of 16.3%. Q4 was the first full quarter with Uni-Select and as communicated, the transaction was dilutive to the segment margin by 220 basis points. Without Uni-Select, North American margins would have been comparable to Q4 2022 and would have delivered a record full year EBITDA margin of 19.7%.', ""Q4 2023 benefited from some incremental sales in October, November attributed to effects of the UAW strike and we don't expect further upside in 2024. The Uni-Select integration is progressing ahead of schedule and with FinishMaster and LKQ locations merging; it's becoming increasingly difficult to determine a standalone Uni-Select impact. Therefore, we will not provide specific Uni-Select impacts on the North American results going forward, but will instead report just on synergy achievement. We expect the 2024 North American full year EBITDA margin, including Uni-Select to be around 17%. As shown on Slide 13, Europe reported segment EBITDA margin of 8.3% down 170 basis points from the prior year period. There were several unusual items which had a negative effect of 110 basis points on the results."", ""First, the strikes at our primary distribution center in Germany continued in Q4 and we estimated the lost revenue and negative effect on the segment EBITDA margin of 50 basis points. Second, we booked a non-recurring compensation charge for $6 million, which impacted the margin by 40 basis points. Finally, we recorded a reserve for a value-added tax matter which lowered the margin by 20 basis points. The remaining margin variance is attributable to inflationary cost effects in SG&A expenses, primarily in personnel costs. Looking ahead to 2024, we project a return to a double-digit margin as we work past the strikes and the transitory effects that dropped the segment below a 10% margin in 2023. Moving to Slide 14, Specialty's EBITDA margin of 5.7% decreased 50 basis points compared to the prior year."", ""Gross margin, which was down 290 basis points year-over-year is under pressure from increased price competition as inventory availability continues to improve for our competitors, in addition to unfavorable product mix, as the lower margin lines such as auto and marine have been less affected by revenue reductions than the RV market. I'm pleased to report our SG&A expenses were favorable by 210 basis points, mostly related to personnel and primarily coming from management restructuring efforts in the last 12 months to align the cost structure with revenue trends and lower benefits and insurance costs. 2023 was a tough year for Specialty, but by focusing on controllable costs, the team was able to mitigate some of the negative leverage effect on margin caused by the revenue decline."", 'Going into 2024, the segment still faces challenging conditions and we expect low-single-digit organic revenue growth. However, we are optimistic about our ability to improve EBITDA margins by 10 basis points to 30 basis points through productivity. As you can see on Slide 15, Self Service profitability improved sequentially to EBITDA margins of 6.0% this quarter from a loss of 0.6% in the third quarter, an increase relative to the 5.2% reported in Q4 2022. Metals prices had a net negative effect on results of $6 million with lower precious metal prices representing a $13 million reduction in EBITDA and lag effects from sequential scrapped steel price changes driving a $7 million improvement. Other revenue decreased by 25% in total, contributing to a reduction in operating leverage of 620 basis points.', 'As part of the actions taken earlier, in 2023, our average car cost decreased by 6% and 18% in Q4 relative to Q3 and Q2, respectively, which provided some margin relief and contributed to the year-over-year improvement. We are pleased with the return on to profitability in the fourth quarter and expect to improve our 2024 segment EBITDA in dollar terms compared to 2023. Shifting to cash flows and the balance sheet. We produced $87 million in free cash flow during the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $1.0 billion. As expected, free cash flow was relatively light in the quarter as we had $96 million of interest payments, including the first payment on the U.S. bond issued in May and $125 million of capital expenditures. At $358 million of CapEx for the year, we exceeded our prior guidance by $58 million as we took advantage of our strong cash flow and liquidity position to make strategic purchases, some of which were pulled forward from our 2024 plan.', ""For the year, the cash conversion ratio is 59% conversion of EBITDA to free cash flow, in line with our targeted range of 55% to 60%. With the future headwinds related to interest expense and capital spending requirements, we are widening our cash conversion target range to 50% to 60%. While we have opportunities to drive trade working capital lower, such as with the supply chain finance program, these opportunities are not as abundant as they were years ago when we began our operational excellence journey. The team has done terrific work to lower working capital levels over the last five years and the effects we're seeing in the strong free cash flow figures. We believe we can continue to generate free cash flow in the range of $1 billion on a recurring basis by converting earnings growth into cash flow, being efficient in our deployment of trade working capital and expanding our supply chain finance program."", 'As of December 31, we had total debt of $4.3 billion with a total leverage ratio of 2.3x EBITDA. We paid down over $375 million in debt between the acquisition of Uni-Select at the beginning of August and year-end, a portion of which came from the sale proceeds related to the GSF business we divested in October. We remain committed to reducing our total leverage ratio to 2.0x within 18 months of the Uni-Select acquisition or more specifically during Q1 2025. Our current maturities include the €500 million senior notes due on April 1. We are working on refinancing options and expect to have a refinancing in place in the near-term. Our effective borrowing rate was 5.8% for the quarter as market rates remained relatively high in the U.S. and Europe.', 'We have $1.2 billion in unhedged variable rate debt, so 100 basis point rise in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by $12 million. I will conclude with our thoughts on projected 2024 results as shown on Slides 6 and 7. Our guidance is based on current market condition, recent trends, and assumes scrap and precious metal prices hold near December prices. On foreign exchange, our guidance includes recent European rates with balance of the year rates for the euro of €1.09, the pound sterling at £1.27, and the Canadian dollar at CAD0.74. We expect organic parts and services revenue growth between 3.5% and 5.5%. Please note that we have one to two more selling days in 2024 depending on the market with the increase coming in the second half of the year.', 'Europe will be down a selling day in Q1 due to the timing of Easter. Our 2024 estimate includes growth associated with the expansion of aftermarket parts volume resulting from State Farm and the impact of Uni-Select, which will be included in organic parts and services revenue beginning on August 1. We are projecting full year adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.90 to $4.20 with a mid-point of $4.05. This is an increase of $0.22 or 6% at the mid-point relative to the 2023 actual figure. Looking at Slide 6 in the presentation, you can see how we get from the 2023 actual EPS to our 2024 guidance. Operating performance is expected to generate growth of $0.22 relative to the 2023 results, with growth coming from all four segments. We expect Europe and North America, including the Uni-Select contribution to generate more year-over-year growth than Specialty and Self Service.', 'The transitory items in Europe noted in the last few quarters are expected to be a lesser impact in 2024 and thus will add $0.09 compared to 2023. The exchange rate benefit is nominal. Commodity prices are expected to be a headwind of $0.09 as the current precious metal prices used in the guidance are below the 2023 average. Excluding the impact of Uni-Select, interest expense is projected to be a nominal impact with a higher average rate mitigated by debt paydowns. Consistent with past practices, we have not anticipated future share repurchases beyond the call date of our guidance. We have included an effective tax rate of 26.8% in our 2024 guidance in line with the final 2023 rate. We expect to deliver approximately $1 billion of free cash flow for the year, achieving an EBITDA conversion to free cash flow in the low 50% range.', 'There are various puts and takes in this estimate, including higher cash payments for interest and building inventory offset by improved earnings and increased payables. Capital spending is expected to be at the high end of our target range again at $350 million, which includes key investments in salvage capacity and Specialty distribution to support productivity and margin enhancement initiatives. We feel good about the projected full year cash flow estimate and the conversion ratio generating $1 billion in free cash flow provides flexibility to continue a balanced capital allocation strategy, including debt paydowns, our quarterly dividend, share repurchases, and investments in high synergy tuck-in acquisitions. In terms of quarterly phasing, we expect the earnings growth to be weighted more heavily to the back half of the year.', ""Q1 has been affected by extreme weather conditions in certain markets and very low catalytic converter prices, which in recent weeks were running near 50% of the price in the same period of 2023. Q1 will also be affected by the timing of Easter, resulting in a lost selling day in Europe. The balance of the year will benefit from the additional selling days mentioned previously and a ramp up of Uni-Select synergies as the year progresses. Thanks for your time today. With that, I'll turn the call to Justin to discuss his vision and priorities for LKQ going forward."", ""Justin Jude: Thank you, Rick, and good morning to everyone on the call. First, I am honored to be chosen to succeed Nick later this year as the next Chief Executive Officer of LKQ and I'm humbled to be able to lead our talented team into the future. I'd like to thank Nick for his mentorship and leadership. Our Board trusted me to lead LKQ through this next chapter, and most importantly, I'd like to thank my wife and kids for their love, patience and support because without them I wouldn't be where I am today. As I prepare to step into the CEO role in July, I am filled with enthusiasm and a deep sense of responsibility. My vision for LKQ is rooted in three fundamental principles: people, growth and operational excellence. People are the heart of LKQ."", ""My first and foremost commitment is to each of my fellow team members across our global organization who are the backbone and essence of LKQ. LKQ's employee-focused culture, centered around communication, accountability, integrity and respect is not just a goal, it's a necessity for our collective success. Growing our business, delivering excellent service and products to our customers is a part of who we are. We will drive revenue organically by growing share of wallet with our customers and being opportunistic on tuck-in acquisitions. And lastly, operational excellence. We will continue to hone our culture of lean management throughout our operations. This will not only improve our financial metrics, but will also provide a consistent and repeatable operating rhythm where our customers will see continual improvements in our service levels."", ""Alongside these principles, we will focus on four key priorities. First, integrate our businesses and simplify our operating model. Second, focus on profitable revenue growth and sustainable margin expansion. Third, drive high levels of free cash flow, which in turn will give us the flexibility to maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy and return capital back to our shareholders. And finally, invest in our future. In the short-term, the North American Wholesale team is focused on the integration of our Uni-Select acquisition and taking full advantage of the tremendous synergies that exist within our global footprint. I'm extremely proud of how the team is performing with the integration. As of today, we have integrated a total of 75 of the 151 FinishMaster locations, representing over 52% of the consolidated revenue."", ""Corporate synergies are largely complete and on pace to slightly exceed our expectations. The overall synergy plan is on track to deliver above our previously stated targets well ahead of schedule. The buffer to buffer business in Canada completed two tuck-in acquisitions in October of 2023, representing a total of 14 locations as we convert some of that market from three step to two step. And buffer to buffer is working closely with our North American and European procurement teams to maximize additional revenue and cost synergies. In January, buffer to buffer placed their first purchase order with our Europe's private label team and we are confident these synergistic orders will increase over time, enhancing our offering and our competitiveness."", ""Importantly, I want to again emphasize that Uni-Select was a unique opportunity that will enable us to widen the moat around our North American business and capitalize on revenue synergies, both in the paint and the hard part side that weren't there prior to this acquisition. Our North American teams are the best operators, motivators and integrators in the industry, and the results since starting our operational excellence journey in 2019 speaks for itself. I am confident of their ability to generate positive, operational, and financial returns with our Uni-Select business integration. Long-term in North America, we will continue to invest both in the recycled and remanufactured EV battery process as we are a natural fit to become the market leader in this growing space."", ""Turning to Europe, over the last 45 days, I've spent time with our European leadership team diving into multiple aspects of their business. Andy Hamilton, our new CEO of Europe and I agree that there are many levers to pull in Europe. Our primary objective is to accelerate the integration of one LTQ Europe to fully leverage the network of our inventory, which today is still largely country specific. By linking the geographical and regional distribution network across our European footprint, we will drive higher levels of productivity, leading to improved fulfillment rates, enhanced customer service, and improved trade working capital. Achieving this objective will allow us to profitably grow and increase our market leading position. Additionally, in Europe, there is an opportunity to grow our offerings in such areas as private label, collision components, diagnostic and calibration, recycling, remanufacturing and EV aftermarket parts."", 'We also have the ability to expand our LKQ Academy, a program that we offer to independent garages to enhance their EV knowledge base and capabilities, allowing these shops to see the changing technology as an opportunity. Lastly, I believe we have an opportunity to rationalize certain areas of our business through facility consolidation and fleet and logistics network optimization, which will allow us to create efficiencies across geographies and product groups. As we work through our ongoing integration efforts, we will continue to assess our mix of businesses and take decisive action to determine if we are the right owners of certain assets prior to integrating. In closing, I am extremely excited about driving our mission forward and expanding a lean operating model across our entire organization with a primary objective to move swiftly.', 'LKQ has an extraordinary history and importantly, an extremely bright future. Now, let me turn it back over to Nick for his closing comments.', 'Nick Zarcone: Thank you, Justin, for your thoughtful perspective and comments, and Rick for that detailed financial overview. Our organization has once again proven to be incredibly resilient in any operating environment. Our global teams have worked with agility and urgency to continuously achieve positive results with our operational excellence strategy in establishing One LKQ, a unified and globally focused team. This success is a direct result of a shared mission amongst our over 49,000 employees, which is simply being the leading global value-added and sustainable distributor of vehicle parts and accessories by offering our customers the most comprehensive, available, and cost effective selection of parts and service solutions while building strong partnerships with our employees and the communities in which we operate.', ""I'm confident LKQ will live that mission in 2024 and excel through this leadership transition. LKQ's future is very bright with Justin at the helm.

He sold seven stocks, including fully exiting four positions."", ""Most of Buffett's transactions made sense. However, not all of them did. One of the legendary investor's decisions was downright baffling."", ""Let me address one thing right off the bat. Buffett's most baffling decision in Q4 had nothing to do with the trimming of Berkshire's huge stake in Apple. It's possible that Buffett didn't want Apple to become even more heavily weighted in Berkshire's portfolio than it already was. Another likely scenario is that one of Berkshire's other two investment managers (Todd Combs and Ted Weschler) sold some of their Apple shares in the part of the portfolio that they manage."", ""Instead, I think that the biggest head-scratcher with Buffett's Q4 transactions was the sale of all of Berkshire's shares of D.R. Horton (NYSE: DHI). Granted, D.R. Horton was only a small holding for Berkshire -- a little under 6 million shares worth close to $642 million at the end of the third quarter. However, the complete exit of the position is still puzzling to me."", ""Berkshire didn't sell any shares of the other two homebuilders in its portfolio -- Lennar and NVR. Exiting the D.R. Horton position without selling any shares of these other two stocks might make sense if D.R. Horton's valuation was much higher. However, that's not the case. D.R. Horton is the least expensive of the three stocks based on forward earnings multiples."", ""The long-term prospects for D.R. Horton and the market in which it competes haven't diminished since the stock was first added to Berkshire's portfolio in the second quarter of 2023. Even if they had, Lennar and NVR would have likely been negatively impacted as well."", 'There was one change made by D.R. Horton in Q4 that perhaps could explain why Buffett or his team sold the stock. The homebuilder appointed a new CEO on Oct. 1, 2023.', ""However, I'm not convinced this was the reason for the sale. D.R. Horton's new CEO is Paul Romanowski. He previously served as the company's executive vice president and co-chief operating officer. Romanowski has been a member of D.R. Horton's management team for more than 20 years. He knows the business well."", ""Importantly, former CEO David Auld isn't leaving D.R. Horton. He moved into the role of executive vice chair of the company's board of directors."", ""I think that buying D.R. Horton stock could be a brilliant move for investors even though Buffett (or his lieutenants) sold the stock. Why? For the same reasons that made Berkshire's exit from the position so perplexing."", ""The U.S. continues to face a serious housing shortage. Moody's Analytics recently estimated the country still needs as many as 2 million homes. The company acknowledged that its number is near the lower end of the range of estimates made by others."", ""There's only one practical solution to this shortage: Build more homes. D.R. Horton ranks as the largest homebuilder in the U.S., a position it's held for more than 20 years. The laws of supply and demand are working in the company's favor."", ""Sure, high interest rates have been a barrier for some Americans who would like to buy a house. However, the Federal Reserve has hinted that rate cuts are on the way this year. Mortgage rates are also impacted by inflation. Even with inflation remaining higher than hoped, though, National Association of Realtors chief economist Lawrence Yun told CBS News earlier in February that he expects mortgage rates will decrease to around 6% later this year. It should bode well for D.R. Horton if he's right."", ""As for valuation, D.R. Horton's shares trade at only 10.3 times forward earnings. That's a lower multiple, by the way, than any of the three stocks that Buffett bought in Q4. When growth prospects are factored in, D.R. Horton stock looks like a steal with a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.57."", 'All in all, D.R.

(NASDAQ:PEP) is about to go ex-dividend in the next four days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. In other words, investors can purchase PepsiCo's shares before the 29th of February in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 1st of April."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.265 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$5.06 per share. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, PepsiCo has a trailing yield of approximately 3.0% on its current stock price of US$169.60. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing."", ' View our latest analysis for PepsiCo ', ""If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. PepsiCo paid out more than half (75%) of its earnings last year, which is a regular payout ratio for most companies. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. It paid out 84% of its free cash flow as dividends, which is within usual limits but will limit the company's ability to lift the dividend if there's no growth."", ""It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""When earnings decline, dividend companies become much harder to analyse and own safely. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. Readers will understand then, why we're concerned to see PepsiCo's earnings per share have dropped 5.7% a year over the past five years. Ultimately, when earnings per share decline, the size of the pie from which dividends can be paid, shrinks."", ""Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, PepsiCo has lifted its dividend by approximately 8.3% a year on average. Growing the dividend payout ratio while earnings are declining can deliver nice returns for a while, but it's always worth checking for when the company can't increase the payout ratio any more - because then the music stops."", ""Has PepsiCo got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? While earnings per share are shrinking, it's encouraging to see that at least PepsiCo's dividend appears sustainable, with earnings and cashflow payout ratios that are within reasonable bounds. Bottom line: PepsiCo has some unfortunate characteristics that we think could lead to sub-optimal outcomes for dividend investors."", ""With that being said, if you're still considering PepsiCo as an investment, you'll find it beneficial to know what risks this stock is facing. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 1 warning sign with PepsiCo and understanding them should be part of your investment process."", ""Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

This isn't a low-risk stock, but it may not be too late to invest in Celsius Holdings."", ""Celsius has been on a growth tear, aided by a popular product and a distribution deal with PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) signed in 2022. That move also coincided with the buyout of distribution deals with previous partners, which is where you see the following losses. But generally, this is a high-growth company that's maintained profitability along the way."", 'Pepsi allows Celsius to grow quickly in North America, where the company generated 96% of its revenue last quarter. But it will also enable international growth, which is almost untapped right now.', ""Part of the reason Celsius can grow so quickly is that it's not a supply constrained business. Pepsi does the distribution, and copackers mix and bottle products. Celsius helps line up the supply chain, but it isn't building factories or buying trucks. This is mainly a drink design and branding company. That's an extremely asset-light model and allows profitable growth."", ""It's difficult to look at Celsius' growth and valuation and not be concerned. Shares trade for 66 times next year's analyst estimates, and analysts expect 66% revenue growth over the next two years. That's a high bar for any company."", ""But there's precedent for this as being a profitable segment of the market. Monster Beverage (NASDAQ: MNST) has always been an expensive stock, yet it's wildly outperformed the market by continually growing revenue year after year."", ""And I think Celsius' addressable market could be significantly bigger than Monster's, given the more accessible product and softer branding behind it."", ""Celsius often falls into the energy-drink category, and that makes sense on the surface, given how Celsius originally positioned itself. But this is a more accessible product than Monster that appeals to a wider, more diverse audience. Celsius has very few calories, provides some vitamins, and has more flavor than flavored water. There's a need for a product like this between water and traditional soda."", ""That's why we see Celsius beginning to be more prominently displayed at big-box retailers, fast-casual restaurants, and even coffee shops. This isn't a niche product. It's a mass-market product that fits between sodas and fancy waters that have become popular over the past decade."", ""What's hard to gauge is what Celsius' opportunity is. I think Celsius could be bigger than Monster in time, and that would mean more than six-fold revenue growth. 2024 will be a step in that direction as the company gets better shelf space and starts to push international growth."", ""Operational momentum is important in consumer-facing brands, and that's a major tailwind for Celsius. As they see it more across the U.S., more consumers are trying it, and all indications are that they're adopting it into their drink routines rapidly."", ""I think this growth trend can last for at least the next decade as Celsius gets into more stores and pushes into more countries. If the company does become bigger than Monster, it would make the company's $14.9 billion market cap a steal today."", 'Watch growth rates closely in 2024 and beyond, but I think this is a winner that will keep winning for long-term investors.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Celsius right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Celsius, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Celsius wasn’t one of them.

Most would be very happy with that. On top of that, the share price is up 16% in about a quarter.

It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Ameriprise Financial's TSR for the last 5 years was 241%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return."", ""Ameriprise Financial shareholders are up 22% for the year (even including dividends).

However, throughout most of 2023, stabilized prices were observed due to elevated interest rates and declining energy prices. Despite a slowing rate of increase, the latest CPI reading remains somewhat discouraging for investors who anticipated a continuous decline in inflation with the latest Federal Reserve monetary policy measures. The most recent report from the Labor Department indicates that in January, the CPI rose 3.1% year-over-year, a decrease from December's 3.4% gain but higher than the expected 2.9% increase. On a monthly basis, the CPI increased by 0.3%, surpassing economists' estimates of a 0.2% gain."", 'The current US inflation and the possibility of a more lenient Federal Reserve policy are sparking discussions about a mild economic slowdown instead of a recession, a severe economic downturn, or a bear market, according to JPMorgan. Leading indicators suggest a deceleration in growth rather than a sudden collapse. Some indicators, such as real estate, corporate, and household delinquency rates, are on the rise, but history shows that these usually trail behind other signals for investors. Essentially, equity markets typically hit their lowest points well before the peak of economic turmoil, with the dot-com cycle being a notable exception. While there is still risk of a recession in 2025, it is important to note that even if it occurs, it is likely to be mild, especially with the Federal Reserve offering significant indirect liquidity to the banking system. JPMorgan acknowledged that investors face challenges, including the impact on public sector finances due to large deficits, markets that have already factored in a very gradual economic slowdown, and the significant influence of mega-cap stocks. In 2023, S&P 500 earnings remained stagnant. However, they surged by 33% for the top 7 mega-cap stocks and declined by 5% for the rest of the S&P 500. Taking everything into account, 2024 seems poised for a year of decelerating GDP growth, single-digit earnings growth, and single-digit returns for the average S&P 500 stock, per the bank’s report. ', 'On February 18, Goldman Sachs increased its year-end target for the S&P 500 index to 5,200, indicating a potential 4% increase from its current levels. This adjustment is attributed to a more positive earnings outlook for the companies within the index. Previously, Goldman Sachs had anticipated the index reaching 5,100 by the end of 2024. This initial projection was then revised from 4,700 in December, driven by factors such as moderating inflation and the anticipation of the US central bank implementing interest rate reductions throughout the year. David Kostin, lead strategist at Goldman Sachs, told Reuters: ', '""We expect strong world GDP growth and a slightly weaker dollar will support EPS, while lower rates and lower oil prices will be a slight drag."" ', ""In 2024, Morningstar believes that the focus will shift towards a more fundamental analysis of individual companies and sectors, moving away from the macroeconomic and behavioral factors that influenced the market in recent years. Economic growth was expected to decelerate not only in the fourth quarter of 2023 but the trend will persist throughout the next three quarters, until a resurgence in the third quarter. Expectations include the Federal Reserve initiating rate cuts in 2024 and throughout 2025, concluding by 2026. This reduction in the federal funds rate is predicted to bring the 10-year Treasury yield down to a long-term projection of 2.75%, a decline from the current 4%. In terms of GDP growth, short-term forecasts align closely with consensus, but over a five-year horizon, Morningstar expects a cumulative 3% higher real GDP growth compared to consensus. This is primarily attributed to perspectives on the supply side, involving labor force expansion and productivity growth. Inflation has significantly receded, and by the second quarter of 2024, a return to the Federal Reserve's 2% target is forecasted."", 'Amid this market backdrop, some investors prefer to buy stocks that are trading near 52-week lows to reap the benefits later.
