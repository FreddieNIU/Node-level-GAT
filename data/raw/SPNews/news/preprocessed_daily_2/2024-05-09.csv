If you wish to skip our detailed analysis of healthcare expenses and the advantages of retiring in Delaware, please proceed directly to the 5 Best Places to Retire in Delaware.', 'The economic hardships of retirement are one of the biggest challenges for Americans today. However, this concern isn’t limited to individuals looking to retire in the next decade. According to Lincoln National Corporation (NYSE: LNC), having enough money in retirement is the second biggest concern for consumers of all generations. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE: SCHW) reports that 99% of Gen Z workers say they are facing obstacles to saving for their golden period. Simultaneously, the amount of money people feel they will require to retire comfortably has increased tremendously since the start of the pandemic.', 'According to Northwestern Mutual, the average American now believes they need $1.46 million to retire comfortably in comparison to $951,000 in 2020. Understandably, Corebridge Financial, Inc. (NYSE: CRBG) reports that only 27% of Americans are very confident or extremely confident that they won’t outlive their retirement savings. Inflation and rising housing costs are two factors that have enabled Americans to come to terms with the reality of how expensive retirement will be. However, one factor that continues to be overlooked is medical care.', 'According to Ben Storey, Director of Retirement Research at Bank of America Corporation (NYSE: BAC), healthcare is the biggest retirement expense that people fail to account for. People tend to overlook the fact that Medicare fails to cover around one-third of all medical expenses, and these costs place a significant strain on retirement earnings.', '“[People believe that] Medicare is going to pay for everything but, in reality, it only covers about two-thirds of your costs. Retirees counting on Social Security to supplement their retirement income are often surprised to learn that most of it may need to be used for healthcare.”', '-Ben Storey, Director, Retirement Research & Insights, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE: BAC)', 'According to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, couples enrolled in a Medigap plan with average premiums will need to have saved $234,000 to have a 50% chance of covering their medical expenditures in retirement and $351,000 to have a 90% chance. These figures may stretch even further as the average retirement period increases across the country. Corebridge Financial, Inc. (NYSE: CRBG) reports that 54% of Americans aim to live to the age of 100, yet 40% of all Americans plan on retiring between the ages of 65-69. This adds up to nearly 3 decades of retirement, due to which 66% of Americans fear running out of money more than death, per Corebridge Financial, Inc. (NYSE: CRBG).', 'At the same time, many Americans are being forced to withdraw funds from their retirement nest eggs to manage immediate financial distress. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE: BAC) revealed that the number of individuals who made a hardship withdrawal from their 401Ks between July and September 2023 was 27% higher than at the start of the year. As Americans struggle to cope with immediate financial costs, retirement savings continue to be neglected. One strategy to maximize retirement savings is to cut down on predictable expenditures such as housing and day-to-day expenses. Many Americans in the Northeast, referred to as the “Snow Belt”, are now relocating to Southern states. Our article on Best Places to Retire in the South shows that cost of living, affordability, and lower taxes are factors that attract retirees to these states. However, for those not keen on relocating too far South, the state of Delaware is one of the best places to retire.', 'There are plenty of reasons to retire in Delaware, the foremost being affordability. The Diamond State has a median home price of $336,300, according to Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ: RDFN). In comparison, Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ: RDFN) reports that the US median home price is $420,321. Similarly, the median nationwide rent for Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: Z) listings is $2,100. In comparison, rental listings in Delaware have a median rent of $1,995, per Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: Z).', 'Moreover, Delaware also offers a very retirement-friendly tax structure. It is one of the states that have no taxes on social security benefits. There are partial taxes on other retirement benefits such as pensions and 401Ks. In addition, it has a State Sales Tax Rate of 0% and an Average Effective Property Tax Rate of just 0.55%, making Delaware a tax-friendly state for retirees. Although the cost of living in Delaware is 1.1% higher than the national average, it is considerably cheaper than both New Jersey and Maryland.', 'With these factors considered, if you are interested in finding out if retiring in Delaware is a good idea, join us as we look at where in Delaware is the best place to retire. Alternatively, you may look at our recommendations for the best places to retire elsewhere on the East Coast, including New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Maryland.', 'To develop our list of best places to retire in Delaware, we initially picked out the most recommended best places to retire in Delaware on the internet.

As a premier producer of direct reduced iron and a significant player in international trading and sales, Nucor Corp operates through its steel mills, steel products, and raw materials segments, with the steel mills segment being the primary revenue generator. The company's financial tables from the recent filing indicate a robust balance sheet, with a strong cash position and a disciplined approach to capital allocation, including strategic investments and share repurchases. Despite a decrease in net earnings from the previous year, Nucor maintains a solid financial foundation, with gross margins reflecting the company's operational efficiency and market adaptability."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with NVR.', ""Market Leadership and Product Diversification: Nucor Corp's market leadership is cemented by its status as North America's largest recycler and a diversified product portfolio that spans across steel mills, steel products, and raw materials segments. The company's vertical integration strategy enhances its operational efficiency, allowing it to maintain a competitive edge in the market. With a strong emphasis on innovation and quality, Nucor has established a reputation for reliability and excellence in the steel industry."", ""Financial Resilience: Nucor's financial resilience is evident in its robust balance sheet, with a cash and cash equivalents position of $5.54 billion as of March 30, 2024. The company's disciplined approach to capital allocation is demonstrated through strategic investments in growth projects and a prudent share repurchase program, which reflects confidence in its long-term prospects. This financial strength enables Nucor to navigate market volatility and invest in opportunities that drive shareholder value."", ""Exposure to Raw Material Price Volatility: Nucor's reliance on scrap steel and other raw materials exposes it to price volatility, which can impact margins and profitability. The company's raw materials segment, which includes scrap brokerage and processing operations, experienced margin compression and decreased profitability due to fluctuations in average sales price per ton. This exposure necessitates effective risk management strategies to mitigate the impact of price swings on the company's financial performance."", ""Sensitivity to Economic Cycles: The steel industry is cyclical, and Nucor's operations are sensitive to economic downturns that can lead to reduced demand for steel products. The company's steel products segment saw decreased profitability from historically high levels, indicating a moderation in market conditions. Nucor must continuously adapt to changing economic landscapes to maintain its competitive position and profitability."", ""Strategic Growth Initiatives: Nucor has significant opportunities for growth through the expansion of its product lines and strategic acquisitions. Capital expenditures for 2024 are estimated to be approximately $3.5 billion, with major projects including the sheet mill expansion in Indiana and the construction of new manufacturing locations for Nucor Towers & Structures. These investments are poised to enhance Nucor's production capabilities and market reach, driving long-term growth."", ""Technological Advancements: Nucor's commitment to innovation presents opportunities to leverage technological advancements to improve operational efficiency and product quality. The company's investments in new technologies, such as the sheet mill under construction in West Virginia, position it at the forefront of industry developments and enable it to meet evolving customer needs."", ""Intense Industry Competition: Nucor operates in a highly competitive industry, where it faces pressure from both domestic and international steel producers. The company's ability to maintain market share and profitability is contingent on its competitive pricing, product quality, and customer service. Nucor must continually enhance its operational efficiencies and product offerings to stay ahead of competitors."", ""Regulatory and Environmental Challenges: The steel industry is subject to stringent environmental regulations, which can impose significant costs and operational constraints on companies like Nucor. Compliance with evolving regulatory requirements and the pursuit of sustainable practices are critical for maintaining the company's social license to operate and for minimizing potential legal and reputational risks."", 'In conclusion, Nucor Corp (NYSE:NUE) exhibits a strong market presence and financial resilience, underpinned by its diversified product offerings and strategic growth initiatives.

Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period.

Shareholders will be interested in what the board will have to say about turning performance around at the next AGM on 15th of May.

We present the case why we think CEO compensation is out of sync with company performance.', ' View our latest analysis for State Street ', ""At the time of writing, our data shows that State Street Corporation has a market capitalization of US$23b, and reported total annual CEO compensation of US$13m for the year to December 2023. That's a notable decrease of 25% on last year. We think total compensation is more important but our data shows that the CEO salary is lower, at US$1.1m."", ""For comparison, other companies in the American Capital Markets industry with market capitalizations above US$8.0b, reported a median total CEO compensation of US$17m. From this we gather that Ron O’Hanley is paid around the median for CEOs in the industry.

State Street pays a modest slice of remuneration through salary, as compared to the broader industry. It's important to note that a slant towards non-salary compensation suggests that total pay is tied to the company's performance."", 'Over the last three years, State Street Corporation has shrunk its earnings per share by 2.6% per year. It saw its revenue drop 1.2% over the last year.', ""Its a bit disappointing to see that the company has failed to grow its EPS. And the impression is worse when you consider revenue is down year-on-year. These factors suggest that the business performance wouldn't really justify a high pay packet for the CEO. Moving away from current form for a second, it could be important to check this free visual depiction of what analysts expect for the future."", 'Given the total shareholder loss of 2.1% over three years, many shareholders in State Street Corporation are probably rather dissatisfied, to say the least. This suggests it would be unwise for the company to pay the CEO too generously.', ""Given that shareholders haven't seen any positive returns on their investment, not to mention the lack of earnings growth, this may suggest that few of them would be willing to award the CEO with a pay rise.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So when we looked at PVH (NYSE:PVH) and its trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw."", ""Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for PVH, this is the formula:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.11 = US$935m ÷ (US$11b - US$2.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to February 2024).', ""So, PVH has an ROCE of 11%.

If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for PVH ."", ""PVH's ROCE growth is quite impressive. The figures show that over the last five years, ROCE has grown 22% whilst employing roughly the same amount of capital. So it's likely that the business is now reaping the full benefits of its past investments, since the capital employed hasn't changed considerably. It's worth looking deeper into this though because while it's great that the business is more efficient, it might also mean that going forward the areas to invest internally for the organic growth are lacking."", ""In summary, we're delighted to see that PVH has been able to increase efficiencies and earn higher rates of return on the same amount of capital. Since the stock has only returned 3.5% to shareholders over the last five years, the promising fundamentals may not be recognized yet by investors. So with that in mind, we think the stock deserves further research."", 'While PVH looks impressive, no company is worth an infinite price.

The index stayed below the 5,200 level it had briefly reached earlier in the week, reflecting a loss of momentum in the stock market. The day's trading was characterized by fluctuations, with notable declines in major technology companies such as Nvidia and Tesla. These losses played a role in tempering Wall Street's enthusiasm for stocks. Uber Technologies also suffered a sharp drop after reporting disappointing first-quarter bookings, while Intel saw a decline due to a downgraded revenue outlook in light of a U.S. ban on chip exports to Huawei Technologies. At the same time, oil prices reversed earlier losses after a decline in U.S. stockpiles suggested a tightening market. West Texas Intermediate crude traded above $78 a barrel as the Energy Information Administration reported a reduction of 1.36 million barrels in inventories. This shift in the oil market is seen as a bullish indicator amid generally bearish technical trends. These factors reflect an inflection point in the market, as investors reassess their positions amid evolving economic conditions, corporate performance concerns, and changes in the oil market. Futures positioning has raised doubts about the strength of the S&P 500's recent gains, suggesting that some investors are more cautious about the sustainability of the rally."", ""On May 8, an official from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expressed concern over the growing divisions between the United States and China, warning that their trade tensions could hinder global economic growth. The U.S. has heightened trade restrictions and sanctions on China, citing national security concerns and ongoing disputes in the South China Sea and around Taiwan, reported CNBC. IMF Deputy Managing Director Gita Gopinath noted that trade relations between the U.S.-led Western bloc and the China-aligned bloc have weakened since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Trade between these blocs has decreased by roughly 12%, and foreign direct investment has fallen by 20% compared to levels within these groups. The IMF estimates that, in the most extreme scenario, these divisions could cost the world up to 7% of its GDP. The pandemic and geopolitical strife have disrupted international trade patterns not seen since the Cold War, according to Gopinath. Increasingly, countries are focusing on economic and national security when making trade and investment decisions. This trend threatens to undermine a rules-based global trading system and the benefits of economic integration. However, while the global economy faces significant challenges due to fragmentation, the overall trade-to-GDP ratio has been relatively stable over the past two decades. This stability is partly due to the role of neutral countries like Mexico and Vietnam, which act as connectors for rerouting trade and investment between the U.S. and China. These non-aligned nations leverage their economic and diplomatic influence to help keep the world economy integrated. The presence of these neutral mediators may serve as a buffer against the full impact of the ongoing U.S.-China tensions, providing a pathway for continued international cooperation and trade."", 'On the stock market front, analysts are bullish on stocks such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), ServiceNow, Inc.

The firm maintained its Overweight rating on the shares due to a significant financial outperformance in the first quarter. The company exhibited strong results in both its top-line and bottom-line performance. Piper Sandler highlighted that despite a mention of some inventory benefits from international channels, the key focus of the story is on the company's advances in its late-stage pipeline. Specifically, Piper Sandler is optimistic about the submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) for vanza, with the potential for approval in January 2025. Additionally, progress on the rolling NDA for suzetrigine, targeting acute pain, is underway and is expected to be completed this quarter. The current market price for Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) stands at $422.52, and the new price target suggests an upside potential of approximately 11%.

(NYSE:WMT) performed well in the first quarter, even with the unpredictable consumer spending environment and challenges such as the impact of an earlier Easter and pressures facing lower-income households. UBS believes that Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) performance in the quarter will meet expectations and demonstrate that the company's strategic investments are paying off. The firm sees Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) ongoing ability to capture market share both domestically and internationally as a significant advantage.

The stock is currently trading at $3,624.05, which indicates an upside potential of 17% following the upgrade. HSBC's decision to increase the price target reflects its preference for Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) within the U.S. online travel market. The firm's analyst noted Booking's advantage in terms of scale and consistent execution, which distinguishes it from competitors in the space. The performance gap between Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) and its peers has become more pronounced, particularly in the first quarter, across various metrics. The recommendation suggests that Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) strong market position and operational effectiveness make it a promising investment opportunity, with room for significant growth. As the company continues to leverage its strengths in the online travel sector, investors can expect potential benefits from its ongoing success."", 'Wedgewood Partners stated the following regarding Booking Holdings Inc.

The Company grew bookings on their platforms +16% and reported +22% growth in adjusted operating income during their fourth quarter of 2023. We think the market is cautious about the Company’s results for 2024 because they will be lapping very high levels of growth compared to those in 2023 (full year 2023 bookings growth +24%). However, Booking’s end markets continue to be quite healthy, outside of geographies affected by war because consumers still have plenty of wallet share to re-dedicate to travel compared to pre-COVID-19 numbers. We applaud the Company as they aggressively repurchase shares at valuation levels well below the market and peers.

D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) is known for its excellence and consistent high-level execution, even in the face of challenging interest rate environments, according to the UBS analyst. The firm believes that D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI), along with other major publicly traded homebuilders, is poised to continue benefiting from robust demographic demand, limited availability of existing homes, and the company's size, scale, and financial advantages compared to most private competitors.

Horton, Inc.\xa0(NYSE:DHI), Inc., and Lennar Corporation – gained 39.4%, 41.8%, and 33.2%, respectively, in the most recent quarter, in part due to the continuation of strong quarterly business results, management optimism about 2024 prospects, and a more than 100 basis point decline in 30-year mortgage rates during the quarter.', '2023 was an excellent year for the public homebuilders. Housing fundamentals were resilient despite the affordability challenges of elevated mortgage rates and home prices. Several years of pent-up demand, fears that mortgage rates could move higher, a dearth of inventory in the existing home market, and an overall housing supply shortage drove home buyers off the sidelines to “stretch their wallet,” in part due to fears that they could miss out on the opportunity to buy a home. The Fund’s homebuilding companies Toll Brothers, D.R. Horton, and Lennar increased 108.0%, 71.4%, and 66.3%, respectively, in 2023.', 'Though we anticipate more modest gains for the Fund’s homebuilder investments in 2024, we remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for Toll Brothers, D.R. Horton, and Lennar. Further, we continue to believe there is a compelling case for the homebuilder valuations to re-rate higher over time.', 'Since the beginning of 2020, D.R. Horton, Lennar, and Toll Brothers have demonstrated substantial resilience and operating prowess.

These new deals look to capitalize on tech-centered developments in both spaces, fusing the scale and brand-building power of CTV with the data-driven, outcomes-oriented capabilities of retail media.', '“Media and ad tech companies need to form relationships with retail media platforms or risk missing out on one of the few large and quickly growing segments of the digital advertising market,” said Eric Haggstrom, director of business intelligence and head of forecasting for Advertiser Perceptions, in a statement around the report.', 'With the upfronts just days away, Disney and NBCUniversal have announced such deals, while Amazon — a leading retail media player with growing video ambitions — has primed the pump for its first upfront event.', ""Partnerships between media companies and retailers have steadily increased in the last few years amid the proliferation of media networks and in advance of the signal loss expected from Google's again-delayed plan to deprecate third-party cookies in Chrome.

GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with RJF.', ""On May 7, 2024, Raymond James Financial Inc (NYSE:RJF) filed its latest 10-Q report, revealing a comprehensive overview of its financial health and operational strategies. As a financial holding company with a diverse portfolio of services, including wealth management, investment banking, asset management, and commercial banking, RJF continues to support a vast network of financial advisors while managing over $1.2 trillion in assets. The recent filing indicates a solid financial performance, with net revenues increasing from $2.873 billion in the first half of 2023 to $3.118 billion in the same period of 2024. Net income also saw a rise from $427 million to $476 million year-over-year. These figures underscore RJF's financial resilience and its ability to generate shareholder value amidst dynamic market conditions."", ""Financial Performance and Market Position: RJF's financial results from the latest SEC filing highlight its robust performance and strong market position. The company's net revenues increased by 8.5% year-over-year, with net income also showing a healthy rise. This financial stability is underpinned by a significant presence in the wealth management sector, where RJF administers over $1.2 trillion in assets. The company's revenue streams are diversified, with a substantial portion coming from asset management and related administrative fees, which saw an increase from $1.302 billion to $1.516 billion over six months. This financial strength provides RJF with the capital to invest in technology, attract top talent, and pursue strategic acquisitions, further solidifying its market position."", ""Capital and Liquidity Management: RJF has demonstrated prudent capital and liquidity management, as evidenced by its regulatory capital ratios and liquidity reserves. The company's Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios have improved, reflecting an increase in regulatory capital and a well-managed increase in risk-weighted assets. RJF's liquidity management framework ensures sufficient funding even in stressed market conditions, with cash and cash equivalents (excluding amounts segregated for regulatory purposes and restricted cash) increasing by $688 million to $10.00 billion. This financial prudence positions RJF to navigate market volatility and invest in growth opportunities."", ""Operational Costs: Despite strong revenue growth, RJF's operational costs have also increased, with total non-interest expenses rising from $2.316 billion to $2.509 billion year-over-year. This increase is primarily driven by compensation, commissions, and benefits, which constitute the largest expense category. As RJF continues to grow, managing these costs will be crucial to maintaining profitability and competitive pricing for its services. The company must continue to seek efficiencies and control expenses to sustain its financial performance."", ""Dependence on U.S. Markets: RJF's revenues are heavily reliant on the U.S. market, with approximately 90% of its revenue generated domestically. This concentration exposes the company to regional economic fluctuations and could limit growth potential. Diversifying revenue streams geographically could mitigate this risk and provide more stable income sources, especially in the face of potential economic downturns in the U.S."", 'Technological Advancements: RJF has the opportunity to leverage technology to enhance its service offerings, improve operational efficiency, and attract a broader client base. Investing in digital platforms and advanced analytics can enable RJF to provide more personalized and efficient services, which is critical in the competitive wealth management and financial services industry. Technological innovation can also lead to new revenue streams and business models, such as robo-advisory services and blockchain applications.', ""Strategic Acquisitions: RJF's strong financial position enables it to pursue strategic acquisitions that can expand its market reach, diversify its services, and enhance its competitive edge. Acquiring firms with complementary capabilities or innovative technologies can accelerate RJF's growth and allow it to tap into new customer segments and markets."", ""Regulatory Changes: The financial industry is highly regulated, and changes in regulations can significantly impact RJF's operations and profitability. For instance, the proposed rules by U.S. banking regulators could result in higher capital requirements and the elimination of the AOCI opt-out election, potentially reducing RJF's regulatory capital ratios. RJF must stay vigilant and adapt to regulatory changes to mitigate their impact on its business model and financial standing."", ""Market Volatility: RJF's performance is subject to market risks, including equity price risk and foreign exchange risk. Market volatility can affect the value of RJF's trading inventory and investment portfolio, leading to potential losses. Additionally, RJF's international operations expose it to currency fluctuations, which can impact its financial results. Effective risk management strategies are essential to minimize the adverse effects of market volatility on RJF's earnings and capital position."", ""In conclusion, Raymond James Financial Inc (NYSE:RJF) exhibits a strong financial foundation and a commanding presence in the wealth management sector. The company's strategic management of capital and liquidity resources positions it well for sustainable growth. However, challenges such as increasing operational costs and dependence on the U.S. market must be addressed. Opportunities in technological innovation and strategic acquisitions present avenues for expansion, while regulatory changes and market volatility remain significant threats. RJF's ability to leverage its strengths, address its weaknesses, capitalize on opportunities, and mitigate threats will be critical"", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Nordstrom currently has an Earnings ESP of +66.67%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner."", 'Investors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.', 'Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher.

In the same way, growth investors often end up investing in expensive stocks. In other words, to make a long-term investment more effective, the principles of both value and growth strategies need to be combined.', 'The quest for a mixed investment strategy led to the introduction of the GARP (growth at a reasonable price) approach.

It does not consider the common situation of changing growth rates, such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth rate followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term.', 'Hence, PEG-based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration.', 'Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy:', 'PEG Ratio less than X Industry Median', 'P/E Ratio (using F1) less than X Industry Median (For more accurate valuation purpose)', 'Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) (Whether good market conditions or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1\xa0or #2 have a proven history of success.)', 'Market Capitalization greater than $1 Billion (This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity.)', 'Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.', 'Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than 5%: Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism, suggesting further bullishness.', 'Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 (Hold) offer the best upside potential.', 'Here are five of the 18 stocks that qualified the screening:', 'MGM Resorts: It is one of the leading companies in the gaming and lodging industry and is well poised to grow on high brand awareness.

The company is benefiting from a robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. Its sustained focus on aligning products with customer needs is driving the top line.Continued deal wins in the international market are another growth driver. The buyout of Slack has positioned the company as a leader in enterprise team collaboration and improved its competitive standing versus Microsoft Teams.

HFX iQ represented 58% of Nevro’s total permanent implants in the first quarter, a 5% increase from the fourth quarter of 2023.In February, Nevro announced the FDA 510(k) clearance for Nevro1 without the need to include the NevroFix group.In January 2024, Nevro implemented restructuring, including laying off 5% of its workforce, a vast majority of which affected internally focused employees and non-customer-facing personnel in the field.', ""In the quarter under review, Nevro’s gross profit rose 10.7% year over year to $71.5 million. The gross margin increased 310 basis points to 70.2%.

Maybe it's because you think you can outperform the major benchmarks. Or it could be that you want more control over what you own. Or maybe you want to target a certain theme or trend, or a strategy like growth stocks, value, or passive income."", ""Investors looking for ETFs that have beaten both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite over the last year have come to the right place. Here's a closer look at the Vanguard Growth ETF (NYSEMKT: VUG), Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF (NYSEMKT: MGK), and the Vanguard Communications Services ETF (NYSEMKT: VOX). Let's see why they are outperforming the benchmarks, and the buy case for each fund."", ""The Vanguard Growth ETF is up 37.3% over the past year and an even better 59.1% since the start of 2023. One look at its holdings, and it's easy to see why."", 'Over half of the Vanguard Growth ETF is concentrated in the ""Magnificent Seven,"" a group of seven tech-orientated companies that includes Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Tesla.', 'Even while Microsoft, Tesla, and Apple have underperformed the Nasdaq Composite over the past year, the group as a whole has still crushed the index thanks to big gains in Nvidia, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet.', 'Basically, any fund with high concentration in Nvidia has a good chance of beating the benchmarks over the last year given it is a large company that has posted monster gains.', 'The Vanguard Growth ETF includes plenty of other growth stocks from various industries. With $224 billion in net assets and an expense ratio of 0.04%, it is one of the most sizable and low-cost ways to invest in growth stocks.', 'If you believe that the top megacap growth companies will continue leading the market higher, consider the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF.', 'The ETF is very top-heavy, with 76% of the fund concentrated in the top 20 holdings and a whopping 87% of the fund in tech, consumer discretionary, or healthcare stocks.', 'The danger of an ETF like this is that just a few companies can move the whole fund. For example, if Microsoft and Apple take a hit, chances are other top tech stocks like Salesforce and Adobe will, too. A big sell-off in Nvidia would likely impact Advanced Micro Devices and other chip stocks.', ""The top holdings in the fund are the usual suspects of major growth stocks. But some names may surprise you, like Costco Wholesale, McDonald's, and Boeing. With just 79 holdings, the fund is more concentrated than other Vanguard funds. For example, the Vanguard Growth ETF has 199 holdings."", 'Between the Vanguard Growth ETF and the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF, the Vanguard Growth ETF stands out as the better option for investors looking for top growth stocks and greater diversification. But the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF is the best fit if you want even more exposure to the largest growth-orientated companies instead of a wider variety that incudes smaller (but still large) growth stocks.', 'With a 0.07% expense ratio, the fund is still a low-cost ETF.', 'The Vanguard Communications Services ETF tracks the performance of the communications sector -- which has been doing extremely well.', 'Communications is one of the more misunderstood sectors in the market. When you think of communications, it may be movies and entertainment, media, telecommunications companies, cable and satellite companies, etc. And while these companies certainly make up a sizable chunk of the fund, the sector is dominated by Meta Platforms and Alphabet. Combined, they make up a jaw-dropping 45.8% of the Vanguard Communications Services ETF.', ""Both Meta Platforms and Alphabet have been crushing the market as of late. But what makes both stocks particularly attractive is that they are cash cows with growth potential, they aren't overvalued, and they both recently announced they will begin paying dividends."", 'Meta has done a masterful job monetizing artificial intelligence (AI), particularly through Instagram. And Alphabet, which was heavily discounted relative to the S&P 500 just a few months ago, just proved in its recent quarter why it is a high-octane cash generator with explosive growth potential in AI.', 'Perhaps most attractive about Meta and Alphabet is that they are inexpensive, even after their recent run-ups. Despite their high growth rates, both companies have the lowest forward price-to-earnings ratios of the Magnificent Seven stocks.', 'Investors looking for the value side of the Magnificent Seven, who also want exposure to high-yield dividend stocks and proven media winners, could consider the Vanguard Communications Services ETF and its reasonable 0.1% expense ratio.', 'There are always risks associated with piling into what is working in the market. Stocks or ETFs that have been crushing the benchmarks have typically seen their valuations stretched thin. A sizable run-up is great for existing shareholders, but folks considering buying the stocks now need to make sure they are doing so for the right reasons -- namely because they believe competitive advantages are here to stay.', ""There's reason to believe that mega-cap growth and the Magnificent Seven can keep beating the S&P 500 and even the Nasdaq Composite for the simple fact that they have so many resources at their disposal and tend to be able to support large capital expenditures and research and development expenses. By comparison, a smaller company must be more precise and probably has more riding on a particular theme, idea, product, or service. A margin for error is crucial when embarking on the AI frontier or navigating a growth slowdown, as in the case of Apple or Tesla."", 'Vanguard ETFs remain an excellent low-cost way to gain exposure to what suits your personal investment objectives or interests.

Apple has been putting its neural engine into processors since 2017 and has previously talked up how it helps power a number of iPhone, iPad, and Mac features for some time.', 'But the M4 unveiling was different, serving as an appetizer for the AI features the company will present at its WWDC event in June, when Apple is widely expected to debut a slew of generative AI-powered software features for its various devices.', 'Apple pointed to a number of the M4’s AI bona fides during the keynote, with vice president of platform architecture Tim Millet specifically noting that the chip is capable of 34 trillion operations per second, a measurement commonly used when describing a chip’s AI performance.', 'Millet also said that the M4’s neural engine is more powerful than any neural processing unit in any AI PC.

The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) returned just 33% during the same time frame. Much of the BMG Foundation Trust's outperformance can be attributed to its largest holdings."", ""Indeed, Microsoft and Berkshire have been brilliant investments over the last three year, returning 74% and 54%, respectively. Here's what investors should know about those stocks."", ""Microsoft reported third-quarter financial results that beat Wall Street's expectations on the top and bottom lines. Revenue increased 17% to $61.9 billion on particularly strong sales growth in enterprise software and cloud services, partly driven by demand for artificial intelligence (AI) products. Meanwhile, GAAP net income jumped 20% to $2.94 per diluted share because of disciplined expense management and stock buybacks."", 'Going forward, the bull case for Microsoft centers on its strong presence in enterprise software and cloud computing. Specifically, Microsoft accounted for 18% of commercial software sales in 2023, and its market share is projected to surpass 21% by 2027, according to Morgan Stanley. Its strong presence in office productivity and enterprise resource planning software is the foundation of that dominance, though its recent launch of generative AI copilots should help drive share gains.', 'Microsoft Azure still trails Amazon Web Services (AWS) in cloud infrastructure and platform services revenue. However, Azure gained 2 percentage points of market share over the last year, and investments in AI products could drive more share gains in the future. Indeed, more than 65% of Fortune 500 companies use Azure OpenAI Service, a platform that lets businesses customize large language models from OpenAI and build generative AI applications. Additionally, recent CIO survey from Morgan Stanley found that Microsoft is the cloud services company most likely to gain market share over the next three years.', 'Looking ahead, the enterprise software and cloud services markets are forecasted to grow at annual rates of 13.7% and 14.1%, respectively, through 2030. Meanwhile, Wall Street expects Microsoft to grow earnings per share at 14% annually over the next three to five years. The problem is valuation. Shares currently trade at 35.4 times earnings, a premium to the three-year average of 32.4 times earnings. Personally, I would keep this stock on my watchlist for now. I would feel comfortable buying shares if the valuation dropped to its three-year average.', 'Berkshire Hathaway reported strong financial results for the first quarter. Revenue increase 5% to $89.8 billion and GAAP earnings declined 64% to $5.88 per diluted share (for Class B shares). However, that decline was due to significant investment gains in the prior year. Operating earnings (which exclude those gains) surged 39% during the first quarter, beating even the highest estimate among Wall Street analysts.', ""Going forward, the bull case for Berkshire is threefold. First, it ranks as one of the largest property and casualty insurers in the world, meaning it consistently collects substantial capital (in the form of premiums) that can be invested into stocks and bonds. Second, CEO Warren Buffett has demonstrated his ability to earn excellent returns on invested capital. For instance, Berkshire's book value per share has increased at 11% annually over the past decade."", 'Third, Berkshire owns dozens of subsidiaries that span freight rail transportation, utilities, energy, and manufacturing. That diversity makes its business quite resilient during economic downturns. Since 1980, Berkshire stock has outperformed the S&P 500 by a median of 4.4 percentage points during recessions and 14.9 percentage points during bear markets, according to Bespoke Investment Group.', 'Going forward, CFRA analyst Catherine Seifert expects Berkshire to grow operating earnings per share at 12% annually over the next three years, while Stephen Biggar at Argus expects the company to grow operating earnings per share at 12% annually over the next five years. Against those estimates, the current valuation of 21.7 times operating earnings seems reasonable.', 'Indeed, Warren Buffett remains confident that Berkshire can outperform the S&P 500 in the coming years, albeit modestly. ""Berkshire should do a bit better than the average American corporation and, more important, should also operate with materially less risk of permanent loss of capital,"" he wrote in his most recent shareholder letter.', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

There didn't seem to be a geographical bright spot for the company, either. North America and U.S. comparable sales fell 3%, including a 7% comparable sales decline, and China comps were down 11%. Starbucks has long touted China as its top growth market, so those results are especially disappointing, especially as the company was experiencing growth in all major markets just a few quarters ago."", 'Overall revenue was down 2% year over year to $8.56 billion, which badly missed estimates of $9.13 billion. Bottom-line results were also disappointing. Adjusted earnings per share fell 8% year over year to $0.68, below the $0.79 consensus.', 'Looking ahead, the news was even worse. Starbucks slashed its EPS guidance for the year from 15%-20% growth to a range of flat to up by low single digits. It also cut its revenue forecast from 7%-10% growth to just low single digits.', 'The stock plunged on the news, given that the results were clearly a disappointment to investors. More importantly, does the sell-off present a buying opportunity? Or does it affirm that the problems are long-term and more intractable than management thinks?', 'There are a number of failures at Starbucks, as the recent report makes clear.', ""First, it's unusual for a business as big and established as Starbucks to cut profit growth guidance from 15%-20% to nearly flat in one quarter. That kind of abrupt change might be understandable if the economy was crashing or there was another black swan event like the pandemic, but that's not what's happening. The economy is relatively stable, and a global business like Starbucks should be diversified enough to absorb local challenges in a market like China, where the economy has been weakening for a couple of years. Either management badly overestimated the company's earlier growth rate, or Starbucks is experiencing a customer exodus that's unique to its brand."", 'CEO Laxman Narasimhan said the company was operating in a ""highly challenged environment,"" but Starbucks\' peers aren\'t having the same problems as it is.', ""Starbucks doesn't have a perfect analog in the global market, but McDonald's, another global quick-service giant, posted a perfectly fine 1.9% growth in comparable sales in its first quarter. Domestic chains are also faring well. Chipotle Mexican Grill, which arguably caters to a similar customer base as Starbucks, continues to post strong growth in the U.S. market, with overall comp sales up 7% in its first quarter."", ""Those results show that Starbucks' challenges look more internal than management seems to think."", 'The company said that visits from occasional customers were down, and it touted its Triple Shot Reinvention with Two Pumps strategy, which includes elevating the brand, scaling the digital business, accelerating new store growth, and implementing up to $3 billion in cost savings.', 'Those are valid goals, but Starbucks seems to have lost its focus on the basic operations that keep customers satisfied and coming back.', ""A number of things need to happen at this point for Starbucks stock to be a buy. One of those things is a return to comparable sales and profit growth, which could involve a large rebranding undertaking, especially after a unionization push that led the company to shut down some U.S. stores. However, there's another more pressing issue investors should be focused on."", ""Narasimhan has led Starbucks for only about a year, but he appears to be on the hot seat with the business now shrinking. Narasimhan was successful as CEO of Reckitt Benckiser, the consumer products company that owns brands such as Lysol, but he'd never run a restaurant before, which could be part of the problem."", ""Starbucks has seen its brand strength fade before, when the wrong CEO was at the helm, and the brand got away from its core focus on coffee. In the past, Howard Schultz, who is effectively the modern company's founder, has had to come in and right the ship."", ""Starbucks may need Schultz to come to the rescue once again as the brand appears to be drifting away from its core mission. The coffee chain is big enough that its competitive advantages won't erode easily, but this is a complicated company, and the bigger it gets, the harder it is to run."", ""Without any clarity about a turnaround, Starbucks isn't a buy right now. I expect the company will eventually overcome the current challenges, but that might require a different leader at the helm, and the process could take years to play out."", ""Starbucks needs to do a lot of work to fix the business, and it's unclear if management is clear-eyed about the challenges facing it."", 'Before you buy stock in Starbucks, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Starbucks wasn’t one of them.

This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher.

Please see the tables and related footnotes in the earnings release for a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and applicable reconciliations. I will now turn the call over to Kevin.', ""Kevin Stein: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for calling in today. First, I'll start off with the usual quick overview of our strategy, a few comments about the quarter, and discuss our fiscal 2024 outlook. Then Mike and Sarah will give additional color on the quarter. To reiterate, we believe, we are unique in the industry in both the consistency of our strategy in both good times and bad, as well as our steady focus on intrinsic shareholder value creation through all phases of the aerospace cycle. To summarize, here are some of the reasons why we believe this. About 90% of our net sales are generated by unique proprietary products. Most of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket revenues, which generally have significantly higher margins and over any extended period have typically provided relative stability in the downturns."", 'We follow a consistent long-term strategy specifically; first, we own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. Second, we utilize a simple, well proven, value-based operating methodology. Third, we have a decentralized organizational structure and unique compensation system closely aligns with shareholders. Fourth, we acquire businesses that fit this strategy and where we see a clear path to PE-like returns. And lastly, our capital structure and allocations are a key part of our value creation methodology. Our longstanding goal is to give our shareholders private equity-like returns with liquidity of a public market. To do this, we stay focused on both the details of value creation as well as careful allocation of our capital.', 'As you saw from our earnings release, we had a strong quarter. Our Q2 results ran ahead of our expectations and we once again raised our guidance for the year. Commercial aerospace market trends remain favorable as the industry continues to recover and progress towards normalization. Global air traffic has surpassed pre-pandemic levels and demand for travel remains robust. Airline demand for new aircraft also remains high and the OEMs are working to increase aircraft production. However, OEM aircraft production rates remain well below pre-pandemic levels. There is still much progress to be made for OEM rates and our results to continue to be adversely affected in comparison to pre-pandemic production levels. In our business during the quarter, we saw a healthy growth in our revenues and bookings for all three of our major market channels: commercial OEM, commercial aftermarket and defense.', 'Revenues and bookings also sequentially improved in all three of these market channels. Our EBITDA has defined margin of 53.2% in the quarter. Contributing to the strong Q2 margin is the continued strength in our commercial aftermarket along with diligent focus on our operating strategy, which is allowing margin performance to expand across all segments. Additionally, we had strong operating cash flow generation in Q2 of close to $230 million and ended the quarter with almost $4.3 billion of cash. We expect to steadily generate significant additional cash throughout the remainder of 2024. Next, an update on our capital allocation activities and priorities. Regarding the current M&A activities and pipeline we continue to expect a fiscal year 2024 closure of the Electron Device Business of Communications & Power Industries, also known as CPI, which was announced on a prior earnings call.', 'We continue to actively look for M&A opportunities that fit our model. As we look out over the next 12 months to 18 months, we continue to see an expanding pipeline of potential M&A targets. This remains a busy time and we are actively expanding our M&A team to address these opportunities. As usual, the potential targets are mostly in the small and midsize range. I cannot predict or comment on possible closings, but we remain confident that there is a long runway for acquisitions that fit our portfolio. Please see our 10-Q for more detail on some smaller but nicely accretive acquisitions that we recently closed. The capital allocation priorities at TransDigm are unchanged. Our first priority is to reinvest in our businesses. Second, do accretive discipline to M&A, and third, return capital to our shareholders via share buybacks or dividends.', ""A fourth option, paying down debt seems unlikely at this time, though we do still take this into consideration. We are continually evaluating all of our capital allocation options, but both M&A and capital markets are difficult to predict. As always, we continue to closely monitor the capital markets and remain opportunistic. As mentioned earlier, we ended the quarter with a sizable cash balance of almost $4.3 billion, which includes the $2 billion of cash from new debt issued during our first quarter of fiscal 2024. That debt was proactively raised for the acquisition of CPI's Electron Device Business and general corporate purposes. We have significant liquidity and financial flexibility to meet any likely range of capital requirements or other opportunities in the readily foreseeable future."", ""Moving to our outlook for fiscal 2024. As noted in our earnings release, we are increasing our full fiscal year 2024 sales and EBITDA defined guidance to reflect our strong second quarter results and our current expectations for the remainder of the year. At the mid-point, sales guidance was raised $75 million and EBITDA as defined guidance was raised $60 million. The guidance assumes no additional acquisitions or divestitures and is based on current expectations for continued performance in our primary commercial end markets throughout fiscal 2024. Our current guidance for fiscal 2024 is as follows and can also be found on Slide 6 in the presentation. Note that the pending acquisition of CPI's Electron Device Business is excluded from this guidance until acquisition close."", 'The mid-point of our fiscal 2024 revenue guidance is now $7.74 billion, or up approximately 18%. In regards to the market channel growth rate assumptions that this revenue guidance is based on, for the defense market, we are updating the full year growth rate assumptions as a result of our strong second quarter results and current expectations for the remainder of the year. For defense, we now expect revenue growth in the mid-teens percentage range. This is an increase from our previous guidance of high-single-digit to low-double-digit percentage range. We are not updating the full year market channel growth rate assumptions for commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket as underlying market fundamentals have not meaningfully changed. Commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket revenue guidance is still based on our previously issued market channel growth rate assumptions.', ""We expect commercial OEM revenue growth around 20% and commercial aftermarket revenue growth in the mid-teens percentage range. The mid-point of our EBITDA defined guidance is now $4.045 billion, or up approximately 19%, with an expected margin of around 52.3%. This guidance includes about 100 basis points of margin dilution from our recent Calspan acquisition. The mid-point of our adjusted EPS is increasing primarily due to the higher EBITDA defined guidance and is now anticipated to be $32.42 or up approximately 25% over prior year. Sarah will discuss in more detail shortly the factors impacting EPS along with some other fiscal 2024 financial assumptions and updates. We believe we are well-positioned for the second half of fiscal 2024. We'll continue to closely watch how the aerospace and capital markets continue to develop and react accordingly."", ""Let me conclude by stating that I'm very pleased with the company's performance this quarter and throughout the recovery for the commercial aerospace industry. We remain focused on our value drivers, cost structure and operational excellence. Let me hand it over to Mike Lisman, our TransDigm Group Co-COO, to review our recent performance and a few other items."", ""Mike Lisman: Good morning, everyone. I'll start with our typical review of results by key market category. For the remainder of the call, I'll provide commentary on a pro forma basis compared to the prior year period in 2023. That is, assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods. In the commercial market, which typically makes up close to 65% of our revenue, we will split our discussion into OEM and aftermarket. Our total commercial OEM revenue increased approximately 21% in Q2 compared with the prior year period. Sequentially, total commercial OEM revenues grew by about 12% compared to Q1. Bookings in the quarter were strong compared to the same prior year period. These booking levels continue to support the commercial OEM guidance for revenue growth of around 20% for fiscal 2024."", ""OEM supply chain and labor challenges persist, but appear to be progressing. Broadly speaking, we continue to be encouraged by the elevated and healthy airline demand for new aircraft. Supply chains remain the primary bottleneck in this OEM production ramp up. As many of you know, concerns have recently arisen around the expected 737 MAX production rate ramp. Time will tell how this plays out. At this time, we remain cautious and are watching for a potential realignment of our current MAX order backlog to reflect the lower production rates. The commercial OEM guidance we are giving today contains an appropriate level of risk around the MAX production build rate for the balance of our 2024 fiscal year. While both the 737 MAX risk as well as other risks remain towards achieving the ramp up across the broader aerospace sector, we're optimistic that our operating units are well-positioned to support the higher production rates as they occur."", 'Now, moving on to our commercial aftermarket business discussions. Total commercial aftermarket revenue increased by approximately 8% compared with the prior year period. I would like to provide a bit more color than is typical on our commercial aftermarket submarkets, as the variation in growth rates seen this quarter across those submarkets was much larger than usual. The 8% growth rate mentioned was primarily driven by the continued strength in our passenger submarket, which is by far our largest submarket. Growth in our passenger submarket was roughly 20% versus the prior year period, and this submarket continues to perform exceptionally well. We also saw good growth in our interior submarket of about the same rate when compared to prior year Q2.', ""These increases were offset by declines in our freight and biz jet submarkets. Freight was down roughly 15% and biz jet was down in the 5% area. The freight decline was primarily a result of the continued return of belly capacity, consistent with what we discussed on our past few earnings calls. The biz jet decline is a result of tempering biz jet flight activity, which has continued to come down from the pandemic hubs. For the full year and as you saw in today's guidance, our outlook for commercial aftermarket growth in the mid-teens is unchanged. We saw a number of elements in our Q2 results that make us confident. Mainly Q2 bookings in commercial aftermarket were strong, running ahead of our expectations, significantly outpacing sales and supporting the full year growth outlook."", 'Additionally, our Q2 point of sales data through our distribution partners, which can be a decent leading indicator, was up significantly, well into the double-digits on a percentage basis. Finally, a reminder, commercial aftermarket can be lumped on a quarterly basis both revenue and the bookings not as lumpy as defense aftermarket, but lumpy nonetheless. Finally, note that our guide for mid-teens percentage growth across our total commercial aftermarket, given today still incorporates the continued drag from the cargo and biz jet submarkets for the balance of this fiscal year. Now, turning to broader market dynamics and referencing the most recent IATA traffic data for March. Mobile revenue, passenger miles surpassed pre-pandemic levels for the first time in February 2024 and continued to do so in March.', 'March 2024 air traffic was about 1% above pre-pandemic and IATA currently expects traffic to reach 104% of 2019 levels in 2024. Domestic travel continues to surpass pre-pandemic levels. In the most recently reported traffic data for March, global domestic air traffic was up 6% compared to pre-pandemic. Domestic air travel growth has been driven significantly by outsized growth in China, which was up 14% in March compared to pre-pandemic. This is a significant improvement from China being down 3% a year ago in March of 2023. Shifting over to the U.S. domestic market, domestic air travel for March was about 4% above pre-pandemic traffic. International traffic has continued to make steady improvements over the past few months. It slightly surpassed pre-pandemic levels for the first time in February.', ""In the most recently reported data for March, international travel was down just 2% compared to the pre-pandemic levels, and this marks a significant improvement from being down about 18% one year ago. In summary, for the commercial aftermarket, we continue to see growth at our passenger and interior submarkets indicative of the continually positive trends in the post-COVID passenger traffic recovery. Our biz jet and freight submarkets are as we'd expect in light of the current trends in their underlying markets. Now shifting to our defense market, which traditionally is at or below 35% of our total revenue. The defense market revenue, which includes both OEM and aftermarket revenues grew by approximately 21% compared with the prior year period."", ""Q2 defense revenue growth was well distributed across our businesses and customer base. Additionally, we saw similar rates of growth in both the OEM and aftermarket components of our total defense market, with aftermarket running slightly ahead of the OEM. We do not expect to see defense revenue growth rates at this 20% plus level continuing for the balance of the year, and we expect some moderation or tempering here as you can tell from the guidance given today. Defense bookings were up significantly this quarter compared to the same prior year period and support the revised defense revenue growth guidance for the full year. Additionally, this quarter we saw growth in U.S. government defense spend outlays. We're hopeful we'll continue to see steady growth here, but as we have said many times before, defense sales and bookings can be lumpy."", ""We know the bookings and sales will come, but forecasting them with accuracy and precision, especially on a quarterly basis is difficult. As Kevin mentioned earlier, we now expect our defense market revenue growth for this year to be in the mid-teens percentage range. This updated guidance for defense primarily reflects stronger than expected Q2 defense sales, as well as the good Q2 bookings. Lastly, I'd like to wrap up by expressing how pleased I am by our operational performance in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Even though we saw some lumpiness in our most profitable end market commercial aftermarket, our operating unit teams did an exceptional job of executing on our value drivers to generate the strong results delivered this quarter."", ""Our management teams remain committed to our consistent operating strategy and servicing the robust demand for our products as we continue through the balance of the year. With that, I'd like to turn it over to our CFO, Sarah Wynne."", ""Sarah Wynne: Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I'll recap the financial highlights for the second quarter and then provide some more information on the guidance update. First on organic growth and liquidity. In the second quarter, our organic growth rate was 16.1% and all market channels contributed to this growth that Mike, Kevin have just discussed. On cash and liquidity, free cash flow, which we traditionally define as EBITDA less cash interest payments, CapEx and cash taxes was roughly $290 million for the quarter, coming in around $950 million on a year-to-date basis. As a reminder, a fiscal year Q1 free cash flow was higher than average due to the timing of our interest and tax payments. For the full fiscal year, our free cash flow guidance is unchanged."", ""We continue to expect to generate free cash flow of approximately $2 billion in fiscal 2024. Below that, free cash flow line, networks and capital consumed $82 million, driven by AR with the highest sales in the quarter and inventory as we support the second half of our year. We continue to expect our annual dollars invested in networking capital to moderate from the elevated levels we've seen over the prior two years, but pinpointing an exact dollar amount of investment for fiscal 2024 is difficult. We ended the quarter with approximately $4.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet and our net debt to EBITDA ratio is 4.6x down from 5x at the end of last quarter. As a reminder, approximately $1.4 billion of this cash is reserved for the anticipated closing of the CPI acquisition."", 'We continue to be comfortable operating in the five to seven net debt EBITDA ratio range, and while we are currently sitting slightly below the low end of this range, our go-forward strategy of capital deployment has not changed and we continue to seek the best opportunities for providing value to our shareholders through our leverage strategy. Even if the interest expense coverage ratio ended the quarter at 3.4x on a pro forma basis, which provides us with comfortable cushion versus our target range of 2x to 3x. During the quarter, we completed a few financing objectives, including pushing out our nearer-term debt stacks, along with repricing approximately $6 billion of our term loan debt from SOFR plus 3.25% to SOFR plus 2.75%. This financing activity effectively pushes out our nearest term maturity dates by two fiscal years, so fiscal 2028, our capital allocation strategy is always to both proactively and prudently manage our debt maturity set, and these actions accomplish that.', ""The financing activity slightly reduced our interest expense of fiscal 2024 reducing expense by $12 million or $25 million on an annualized basis. However, as you'll note, our guidance for the interest expense has decreased by $60 million, primarily driven by the interest income we received year-to-date and project for 2024. We remain approximately 75% hedged on our total $22 billion gross debt balance throughout fiscal 2026. This is achieved through a combination of fixed rate notes, interest rate caps, swaps and collars. This continues to provide us adequate cushion against any rise in rates, at least in the immediate term. With regard to guidance, as Kevin mentioned, we increased our mid-point sales and EBITDA by $75 million and $60 million respectively given strong quarter and current expectations for the year, along with increasing our EBITDA margin guidance from 52% to 52.3%."", ""Our adjusted EPS guidance is now $32.42 compared to the prior guidance of $30.85.

GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with SPG.', ""Simon Property Group Inc (NYSE:SPG), a leading real estate investment trust in the United States, filed its 10-Q report on May 7, 2024, revealing a detailed account of its financial performance and strategic positioning. The company's portfolio, which includes a diverse range of properties such as traditional malls, premium outlets, and lifestyle centers, has demonstrated resilience and growth, with lease income rising from $1.25 million in Q1 2023 to $1.30 million in Q1 2024. Comprehensive income also saw a significant uptick, from $456,680 to $739,528 in the same period. These figures underscore SPG's ability to generate robust revenue streams and maintain a strong market position despite the evolving retail landscape."", ""Diversified Property Portfolio: SPG's diverse portfolio, which includes 230 properties across various retail formats, is a testament to its strategic asset allocation. This diversification not only mitigates risks associated with market volatility but also provides multiple revenue streams. The company's sales per square foot, a critical retail metric, has impressively climbed from $693 pre-pandemic to $743 in 2023, indicating strong operational performance and an ability to attract high-value tenants."", ""Strategic Investments and Joint Ventures: SPG's 21% interest in Klepierre and joint-venture interests in 33 premium outlets across 11 countries exemplify its strategic investment approach. These interests not only expand SPG's global footprint but also provide it with a share in the lucrative European retail market, diversifying its income and spreading geographical risk."", ""High Levels of Debt: The company's total liabilities stand at $29.93 million as of March 31, 2024, reflecting a significant level of indebtedness. While this debt finances SPG's expansive portfolio, it also poses a risk to financial stability, especially in an environment of rising interest rates. The interest expense of $230,623 for Q1 2024 further emphasizes the cost burden of this debt."", ""Depreciation and Amortization Expenses: SPG's depreciation and amortization expenses remain substantial, totaling $307,369 for Q1 2024. These non-cash charges, while a normal aspect of real estate operations, indicate the substantial capital investments made in property and the ongoing cost associated with maintaining a large and aging asset base."", 'E-commerce and Omnichannel Retailing: The rise of e-commerce presents SPG with opportunities to transform its properties into omnichannel retail hubs. By leveraging its physical spaces, SPG can offer fulfillment and distribution centers for online retailers, thereby creating new revenue streams and partnerships.', ""Redevelopment and Expansion Projects: SPG's ongoing redevelopment and expansion projects are poised to enhance property value and attract new tenants. With a focus on adding anchors, big box tenants, and restaurants, these projects are likely to increase foot traffic and drive up sales per square foot, further solidifying SPG's market position."", ""Retail Industry Disruption: The retail industry is undergoing significant disruption, with changing consumer preferences and the growth of online shopping. These trends could impact the foot traffic and profitability of SPG's properties, necessitating a strategic response to remain competitive."", ""Economic Volatility: Economic fluctuations can affect consumer spending and, consequently, tenant sales. SPG's high debt levels could become more burdensome in an economic downturn, impacting its ability to service debt and invest in growth opportunities."", ""In conclusion, Simon Property Group Inc (NYSE:SPG) exhibits a robust financial foundation and strategic market positioning, as evidenced by its latest 10-Q filing. The company's strengths lie in its diversified property portfolio and strategic investments, which have enabled it to navigate the dynamic retail landscape effectively. However, SPG must address its weaknesses, including high levels of debt and significant depreciation expenses, to maintain its competitive edge. Opportunities for growth through e-commerce integration and property redevelopment are promising, but SPG must remain vigilant of threats from industry disruption and economic volatility. Overall, SPG's SWOT analysis reveals a company with the potential to leverage its strengths and opportunities to overcome its weaknesses and threats, positioning it well for future success."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

While costs related to technological upgrades might impede bottom-line growth, industry players will eventually witness improved operating efficiency. These factors will keep aiding investment banks like Morgan Stanley MS, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. GS and Piper Sandler Companies PIPR.', 'Industry Description', 'The Zacks Investment Bank industry consists of firms that provide financial products and services that include advisory-based financial transactions to corporations, governments and financial institutions worldwide. These started as partnership firms focused on initial public offerings (IPOs), secondary equity offerings, brokerage and mergers and acquisitions (M&As). Gradually, the companies have evolved into providers of various other services, including securities research, proprietary trading and investment management. Therefore, the industry players work mainly through three product segments — investment banking (M&As, advisory services and securities underwriting), asset management and trading and principal investments (proprietary and brokerage trading).', '3 Themes to Influence the Investment Bank Industry', 'Resurgence in Underwriting and Advisory Businesses: After a sustained weakness in underwriting, IPOs and deal-making activities since 2022 due to geopolitical tensions, global supply-chain disruptions, aggressive monetary policy tightening worldwide to control inflation and potential recession risks, green shoots in advisory and underwriting businesses are visible with the deal pipeline looking healthy.With the macroeconomic environment steadying and the corporates globally adjusting to the high-rate regime, global underwriting and M&A activities are expected to rebound in the coming days. Though the ride will likely be bumpy for investment banks in the near term, the improving operating backdrop will support the industry players’ revenue growth.Trading Business Offers Some Support: Client activity in the trading business largely depends on the prevalent macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions. Since 2022, market volatility has significantly increased due to several geopolitical and macroeconomic headwinds. Though there has been some stability in the macroeconomic backdrop, markets continue to grapple with high global inflation, high interest rates and other geopolitical matters. So, trading volumes will likely remain decent, driven by solid client activities in equity and fixed-income businesses, thereby boosting industry players’ trading income.Technology to Improve Operating Efficiency: Innovative trading platforms, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and investments in technology and advertising are likely to aid the operations of investment banks. The industry players are attracting and retaining the best talent for building a leadership team and spending heavily on technology to help clients with infrastructure development and new platforms. While investment banks will likely face increasing technology-related expenses in the near term, these initiatives are expected to improve operating efficiency over time.', 'Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Prospects', 'The Zacks Investment Bank industry is a 14-stock group within the broader Zacks Finance sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #23, which places it in the top 9% of more than 245 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of encouraging earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. In the past year, the industry’s earnings estimates for the current year have been revised 34.2% upward.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to bet on, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.', 'Industry Outperforms Sector and S&P 500', 'The Zacks Investment Bank industry has underperformed its sector and the S&P 500 over the past year.

The industry is trading at a considerable discount when compared with the market at large, as the trailing 12-month P/TBV ratio for the S&P 500 is 10.96X and the median level is 10.33X.', 'Price-to-Tangible Book Ratio (TTM)', '\xa0', 'Finance stocks typically have a lower P/TBV ratio, so comparing investment banks with the S&P 500 may not make sense to many investors.

The Zacks Finance sector’s trailing 12-month P/TBV ratio of 4.79 and the median level of 4.34 for the same period are above the Zacks Investment Bank industry’s respective ratios.', 'Price-to-Tangible Book Ratio (TTM', '', '3 Investment Banks Worth Investing', 'Morgan Stanley: This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock operates globally as an investment banking, securities and investment management company. Based in New York, the key source of Morgan Stanley’s earnings stability is its business diversification initiatives.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Morgan Stanley has been undertaking several initiatives aimed at increasing reliable revenue sources. Strategic expansion efforts, including the acquisitions of Eaton Vance, E*Trade Financial and Shareworks, are in sync with its efforts to focus less on a capital markets-driven revenue mix.In a move that signals their commitment to further collaboration and innovation, last year, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. and Morgan Stanley announced the launch of ""Alliance 2.0"". This will see combined Japanese equity research, sales and execution services for institutional clients at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities and Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities. Also, their equity underwriting business will be rearranged between the two brokerage units. These efforts will solidify the company’s position in Japan’s market.A favorable macroeconomic backdrop is expected to revive its investment banking (IB) business, thereby further strengthening Morgan Stanley’s financials going forward. The demand for both advisory and underwriting businesses will likely rise as corporates realize that higher interest rates are here to stay for a longer period.Though steadily increasing expenses pose a headwind, a strong balance sheet, higher rates, reversal in investment banking performance and investment-grade long-term ratings from leading credit rating agencies are likely to continue aiding growth.With a market cap of $154 billion, MS is expected to continue benefiting from its scale and business expansion efforts.

Mikulich.', ""All right, good amount of focus on the health of the consumer and what they may or may not be buying come the holiday season.Yes, we're actually starting to think about the holiday shopping season.Talk some toys with Mattel, CEO in on cries and good to see you again.It feels like we were just here like we were just here a year ago, right?What year it was.I know.So what's our masters of the universe?Big news out of your company?Why is that so important?And how are you going to grow it?Well, masters of the universe is an iconic brand, an incredible mythology, and we could not be more excited about bringing this movie to the big screen and the small screens as well.Uh, all the screens.Uh, it's a great franchise, and it's really part of our strategy to continue to capture value for Mattel outside of the toy Ale.Our vision for Mattel Films is to collaborate with leading filmmakers to create standout quality movies based on our iconic brands and, uh, attach culture and appeal to audiences everywhere.And it's very much about that journey.Of course, home ra with Barbie.We all know that.How do you make every movie Barbie ish like?Should investors be thinking masters of the universe is gonna perform like Barbie?Well, we don't say that every movie will be the next Barbie, but we're absolutely looking to apply the same methodology and the same approach in collaborating with leading filmmakers, leveraging and amplifying their creative vision in our iconic brands, then creating demand in the marketplace the way we are approaching all of our brand evolution is about infusing brand purpose and cultural relevance.And this is the common theme that we expect that will play out in all of our product and experiences.That very much has been behind the success of Barbie, of course, in collaboration with the creative genius of Greta Gerwig, bringing and creating something that will stand out in culture.So when does masters of the universe When does that hit?And you know, what is that?What is that marketing campaign?Because I was thinking back to Barbie and that whole campaign, I mean, it captured It wasn't just a US thing.It was a global phenomenon.That's right.The Barbie campaign was very much about demand creation and how we collaborated with the Warner Brothers who did an incredible job on the marketing side of the movie.And then we came with our capabilities and created a cultural event through marketing and promotion and activation all over the world, across retail and with consumer products.Masses of the universe is an incredible franchise.It has a large built in fan base.We see incredible demand among adult collectors, also with Children.The Netflix shows are doing very well the animated series on Netflix and we are very excited about creating yet another global event, and the approach will be about infusing purpose, creating cultural relevance and currency.Our job as a company is to take brands that are timeless and make them timely.And what you saw in the Barbie movie is how we approach all of our projects.Of course, it will be different executions, different genres, different demographics.But the approach and opportunity is the same.When I saw the masters of the Universe news head, I thought, I'm really old now, like I remember watching this stuff as a kid.You never you're never old to to to enjoy these brands these brands are just incredible, and they always play out.So talk to us, uh, about Barbie.What are sales look like for that brand this year?Just from a doll perspective, given the big year you had last year, Barbie is such an incredible, incredible brand.Barbie is so much more a doll.Barbie is a pop culture icon, and the success of the movie really opened the aperture for Barbie as a brand to play, uh, across multiple categories, a broader audience and, uh, bigger demographics that that will connect with the brand.At an emotional level, Barbie has incredible and exciting activations.This year, Barbie is celebrating her 65th anniversary.We are launching three new lines for the brand.We are expanding into adult collectors.We're launching a new mobile game in partnership with Take Two Interactive later this year, and there will be more activations for the brand.And this is really not about this quarter or this year.It's about Barbie's momentum for years to come.It's such a broad canvas of opportunity and innovation and imagination with a very strong brand purpose, but also keeping the Barbie relevant current and in touch with with, uh, with culture, you have to be working on a sequel.Now.You know, we've always said that our goal is to create film franchises.It's not just about one movie but creating film franchises.And this is, uh, more broadly, not just about Barbie.This is the approach.And given the strength and appeal and broad, uh, consumer, uh, fan base that we have with our brands, this is an exciting opportunity for us to continue to broaden our offering.As you know, we've announced 15 movies in development.There's more coming.We continue to build and strengthen the creative packages of these of these projects, led by some of the most prolific creators of our time.And this is really the model to partner and amplify the creative vision of our partners.And it worked very well with Barbie, and this is the approach we are applying to the other projects.How do you keep the team?The team grounded after a year like that?You know, we always look for, uh, you know, to create the next exciting opportunity for the company.It is always about moving the ball forward.We don't see it as a as a journey that ends anywhere.There is no end to this.This is an ongoing opportunity for the company, the way we believe where we are today.This is still early, very early in our journey.It's clearly working, and the strategy is proving itself.We've demonstrated and have showcases across multiple categories, and it's not just about Barbie, and not just in movies.It's also in television, in consumer product, in merchandise in location based entertainment.We are launching the first mail park later this year, and the second one is already announced for 2026.We are expanding our digital offering mobile games, and more and more opportunities will open up in today's world.It's all about the big brands, the big brands that have a built in fan base.And our opportunity as a company is to continue to grow our toy business, our IP driven toy business, and further expand our entertainment offering.So it's not one instead of the other.It's symbiotic, and the opportunity that we can drive growing and thriving toy business would reflect back on the opportunities outside of the toy aisle and vice versa.What's your sense of how retailers are placing orders for the holidays.We're not that far away.They place what orders, what, six months, usually in advance or if not before, we believe the toy industry is in a good place.The industry as a whole is expected to decline this year, but less than last year.Part of it is driven by the lack of theatrical toy movies that the drive toy demand.But the industry is an important category for retailers.It drives food, traffic, It's experiential, the items are very affordable, and you really play into a fundamental human behaviour that is not going away.Physical play is not going away.And yet, as the owner of the underlying rights for for the toy toys that we sell, you can take those assets, those iconic brands, and extend them to other domains.And this is the This is our journey.This is our strategy to continue to grow, uh, within the toy business and expand our entertainment off.I want to leave a little time on this because we haven't really talked about this in the past times that we have talked.You spent your lot so much your career as a TV executive.What is going on with these linear networks?I'm sure you're watching the battle for for Paramount that Disney come out report earnings challenges in their in their legacy business.Can these assets be fixed?And how do you How would one go about fixing them?It is.It is a challenging time in the industry.There's a technology that that change the economic, uh, model, uh, in the short term.But over time, I believe that technology will create more opportunities, more areas of growth for content creators, for IP owners and for people to connect and engage with their favourite brands and experiences the entertainment industry.And and the competition for a share of mind is more sophisticated.There are more more distribution opportunities.There is more supply of content and other offerings, but quality content will always win.Big brands will always rise above the competition.Access and engagement to big A large fan base is critical to be successful, and I believe there are opportunities that will come out of this period.Does traditional cable survive, and in what form?You know, it's still, uh uh, the the economics of the cable model are still being worked out.Some of the channels channels, the television channels and broadcast channels or cable channels that are being disrupted have important domain and, uh, and high awareness.But it's all about how do you repurpose and how do you continue to leverage these brands in throughout the distribution opportunities and and creating a relationship with with the consumer with the with the viewer.Our approach and how we evolve as a company is to think of people who buy our product not just as consumers, but as fans.And we've talked.We've talked about it before.This has been a key part of our evolution as a company.We no longer think of ourselves as a toy manufacturer that is selling items, but as an IP company that is managing franchises.And when you think of people who buy a product as fans and in the aggregate, many fans become an audience, it's a very different conversation, and that creates more opportunities for companies like Mattel that own such important brands.We just got to feed these TV networks more Barbie.I mean, let's give them that content.Uh, Anan, that'll save them.Uh, Anan cries mittel always a pleasure to see you.Thank you so much for always making time to find""]"

The benchmark reclaimed the 5,200 level in the latest trading session before ending below the level. This can be attributed to solid corporate earnings and renewed bets for Fed rate cuts that have rekindled investors’ interest in the stock market. Additionally, the resurgence in tech stocks with the resumption of the AI craze added to the strength (read: S&P 500's Best 3-Day Run in 2024: ETF Areas That Won). \xa0SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, the proxy version of the S&P 500 Index, has risen 3% in the past week. While many stocks have powered the ETF, we have highlighted five that led the way higher. These are Bio-Techne Corporation TECH, Howmet Aerospace HWM, Garmin Ltd. GRMN, Aptiv PLC APTV and Amcor AMCR.The picture emerging from the first-quarter earnings season continues to be one of steady improvement and resilience, with the earnings growth pace modestly accelerating and estimates for the coming periods starting to increase. Total earnings of the 310 S&P 500 members that have reported first-quarter results have risen 5% from the same period last year on 4.5% higher revenues, with 78.1% beating EPS estimates and 59.4% beating revenue estimates.A softer-than-expected jobs report revived bets for an earlier rate cut from the Federal Reserve. U.S. service sector activity also unexpectedly contracted in April after growing for 15 consecutive months. The futures market is now pricing in at least two interest rate cuts by the end of the year. Traders are now wagering that the central bank will begin trimming rates as soon as September but still maintained only around a 44% probability of such a scenario, according to the CME Fedwatch tool. However, the Fed, in its latest policy meeting, signaled that its fight against inflation will continue for a longer period, setting the stage for a period of extended higher rates (read: 4 Sector ETFs & Stocks Likely to Benefit Despite Soft Jobs Data).In another recent weak data, consumer confidence dropped last month to the lowest level since mid-2022.

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So when we looked at the ROCE trend of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) we really liked what we saw."", ""If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Netflix, this is the formula:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.20 = US$7.9b ÷ (US$49b - US$9.3b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).', ""So, Netflix has an ROCE of 20%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 11% earned by companies in a similar industry."", ' View our latest analysis for Netflix ', ""In the above chart we have measured Netflix's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for Netflix ."", ""The trends we've noticed at Netflix are quite reassuring. Over the last five years, returns on capital employed have risen substantially to 20%. Basically the business is earning more per dollar of capital invested and in addition to that, 94% more capital is being employed now too. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers."", 'To sum it up, Netflix has proven it can reinvest in the business and generate higher returns on that capital employed, which is terrific. And with a respectable 72% awarded to those who held the stock over the last five years, you could argue that these developments are starting to get the attention they deserve. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.', 'While Netflix looks impressive, no company is worth an infinite price.

But it still has the potential to continue rewarding shareholders in the long run. With that being said, can Netflix become a trillion-dollar company by 2035?"", ""The company's ascent has been nothing short of amazing. By creating a better user experience, one focused on convenience and broad content choices, Netflix has registered unbelievable growth. Revenue in 2023 of $33.7 billion was up 666% from a decade before. The current subscriber base of 270 million has climbed astronomically higher over the years."", ""But the Netflix of today is a far different animal than the one from the past. The company's service is reaching a more mature stage in its key markets, particularly in the U.S. And the leadership team just announced that it will stop reporting quarterly subscriber numbers starting next year, instead prioritizing revenue growth and engagement."", ""Investors shouldn't be concerned, though. The business added 9.3 million net new subscribers in the first quarter, while posting a revenue gain of 14.8%. Netflix is finding tremendous success in new areas that it previously didn't focus on. The ad tier reported 65% quarter-over-quarter membership growth, signaling a real interest from people looking for a cheaper option. Netflix also launched a campaign to crack down on password sharing, requiring users to sign up for their own accounts."", ""Besides these two successful moves, the company is venturing into new content opportunities. Of note is the recent deal signed with TKO Group to bring Raw to Netflix starting next year. There are also reports swirling that Netflix might bid for the rights to stream NBA games. Getting into live sports is something that the executive team said would never happen. We'll see if this actually comes true."", ""Despite its monumental rise over the past decade, Netflix is still staring at a sizable expansion opportunity. Management estimates that there are about 500 million smart-TV households worldwide (this figure doesn't include China, where Netflix isn't available). This gives the company plenty of room to slowly grow its user base and revenue potential."", 'From a financial perspective, Netflix has never been more lucrative. Critics always called out how much money the company was spending on content, believing that Netflix would never start producing cash. That was the wrong view.', 'After generating $6.9 billion of free cash flow in 2023, management expects to produce $6 billion this year. This is the money left over after Netflix invests in content. Netflix has now implemented a share buyback policy, returning excess cash to shareholders.', ""As of this writing, Netflix sports a market cap of $244 billion. For the company's valuation to rise approximately four-fold over the next 11 years, it implies an annualized increase of about 13%. That's not a wildly bullish outcome."", ""In the past 10 years, Netflix's market cap soared by more than 1,100%. It's safe to assume this growth rate will slow down dramatically going forward."", ""Even so, I think joining the exclusive $1 trillion club is within the realm of possibility. Netflix trades at a price-to-sales ratio of 7.2, which is in line with its trailing 10-year average. If this multiple remains the same, which is anyone's guess, the business needs to grow revenue by about 13% per year between now and 2035. If it can, the company's market cap can get to $1 trillion."", ""It's not impossible to believe that can happen."", 'Before you buy stock in Netflix, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Netflix wasn’t one of them.

However, some shareholders may still want to keep CEO compensation within reason.', ' View our latest analysis for Phillips 66 ', ""Our data indicates that Phillips 66 has a market capitalization of US$62b, and total annual CEO compensation was reported as US$23m for the year to December 2023. That's a notable increase of 41% on last year. While we always look at total compensation first, our analysis shows that the salary component is less, at US$1.6m."", 'On comparing similar companies in the American Oil and Gas industry with market capitalizations above US$8.0b, we found that the median total CEO compensation was US$15m.

It's interesting to note that Phillips 66 allocates a smaller portion of compensation to salary in comparison to the broader industry. If total compensation is slanted towards non-salary benefits, it indicates that CEO pay is linked to company performance."", 'Phillips 66 has seen its earnings per share (EPS) increase by 65% a year over the past three years.

It relies on 11 major refineries within the state to produce its unique blend.', 'Anlleyn Venegas, a senior public affairs specialist at AAA, explained that only some states use this blend, limiting California’s supply during refinery issues.

It's a pleasure to be here today to share our considerable progress during Q1, including our initial findings from our Phase one study of our EGFR targeted Probody T-cell engager, CX nine oh four. Cytomx is highly focused on addressing major unmet needs in oncology using our Probody therapeutic platform, a proprietary antibody masking strategy designed to improve the therapeutic window from multiple antibody modalities through tumor localized activation.

Strategic partnering is a long-standing components of our corporate strategy, and we're proud to be working closely with Bristol-Myers Squibb, Amgen, Astellas, Regeneron and Moderna on multiple Probody therapeutic programs. We continue to be in a strong financial position with $150 million of cash at the end of Q1, which provides cash runway to the end of 2025, not including any milestone payments under our existing collaborations or any potential new partnership funding CytomX is very strong organizationally with integrated R&D capabilities, continued investment in our core technology and a deeply experienced team dedicated to our vision of transforming lives with safer, more effective therapies Moving to Slide 6. The CytomX X product design strategy using our Probody therapeutic platform is informed by more than a decade of experience and seeks to balance target selection, marketing strategy and effector function to make meaningful impact in key areas of unmet need in oncology. Ch nine oh four brings the EGFR target together with T-cell engagement via CD. three with the goal of T-cell mediated killing of EGFR positive tumor types, potentially including those for which conventional antibodies have not shown activity six two zero five one is unmasked conditionally activated ADC that integrates the high potential of EpCAM as a cancer cell target with the potency of a topo one inhibitor payload ideally suited, we believe to high EpCAM expressing tumors like colorectal cancer. CHAO. one leverages the potent activity of the cytokine interferon alpha, which in this case is the effector mechanism itself. Amassed interferon is designed to locally activate the intra-tumoral immune microenvironment with potential to drive responses across multiple cancer types, including melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Q1 was an extremely productive quarter for Cytokinetics we are executing to our plans and we're making progress across the full breadth of our pipeline. Today, we're announcing positive initial Phase 1a dose escalation data for monotherapy CX nine oh four REGFRCD. three T cell engager in solid tumors. And this is the main topic of our update here today. In addition to our exciting progress with CX nine oh four. During Q1, the first dose cohort cleared in the Phase one clinical study of two oh five one, our ADC targeting EpCAM. This study is focused largely in colorectal cancer, and we anticipate initial data in the first half of 2025. Also during Q1 Phase one study initiation activities continued for CX eight oh one. Our mass interferon alpha, including the execution of an agreement with Merck to supply Keytruda for combination with CX. 81. We announced that agreement last night initial data from the eight oh one program is also anticipated in 2025 for them. We continue to make excellent progress across our collaborations, including earning $10 million of milestones under our T-cell engaging bispecific collaboration collaboration with Astellas. That was for preclinical progress on the first two programs in the alliance. We were also delighted to welcome Dr. Xu to our Board during Q1. So a really productive start to 2024 for CytomX is on all fronts. And our current clinical pipeline is really gaining momentum. And we have a very exciting 12 to 24 months ahead of us. Moving now to our T-cell engager strategy. T-cell engaging bispecific antibodies, of course, have enormous potential for the treatment of cancer. And our first demonstrated meaningful clinical clinical benefit in hematologic malignancies and looking at the solid tumor landscape for T cell engagers. However, it's taken time to see meaningful clinical progress and for this modality to really breakthrough in solid tumors. There are some significant challenges to overcome. Notably T cell engagers bring very high potency, and this potency can lead to toxicities in normal tissues where the tumor actually have interests may also be present. Another key limitation for T cell engagers in solid tumors is cytokine release syndrome resulting from systemic binding to CD3 on T cells and also neurotoxicity in the form of ICAT. at CytomX is we have a broad based program focused on masking T-cell engagers to decrease tumor antigen binding in normal tissues and also decrease CD3 binding in the periphery, thereby improving therapeutic index. In addition to our internal programs, we're working with partners, Amgen and Astellas, Regeneron and BNS. in this exciting space, CX nine oh four is our lead program in the T-cell engager area, and I'd like to spend a few minutes now walking through the history and structure of this molecule. We've had a long-standing interest in EGFR Cytomedix. Our seminal publication of the first ever successful antibody masking was focused on on the EGFR binding antibody cetuximab, for which we showed a marked reduction in systemic skin rash for the mast antibody compared to the unmasked group. These findings set the stage for the evolution of the mono specific EGFR Probody into our CX nine oh four bispecific T-cell engager. We reason that EGFR as a target has so much more potential to be realized and the realization of this potential would require a more potent effector mechanism, leading us to the concept of the mass EGFRCD. three strategy encompassed in CX nine oh four. We did actually publish an early lead molecule from this program in cancer research. I have to demonstrate preclinical proof of concept, and we subsequently refined the structure using the depth of our platform and in collaboration with our partner, Amgen. The next slide shows the molecular architecture of nine oh four CX nine oh four has one CD3 binding domain and one EGFR binding domain. Both domains amassed with unique peptides. Furthermore, the protease cleavable substrate are different in each binding domain, reflecting our preclinical fine tuning strategy for optimization of therapeutic window. Series nine oh four also has an Fc region as would be expected to have an antibody-like half-life. This overall structure is somewhat similar to Amgen's tocilizumab that has shown impressive results in small cell lung cancer, shown on the right of this slide is a recap of the therapeutic concept for CX nine oh four and for our platform, generally, the concept is that masking reduces drug binding to target in normal tissues where the tumor tissue, the master removed by activated tumor proteases. This tumor localization leads to the improvement or creation of a therapeutic window for the EGFR CD3. As Jean-Pierre has been shown previously, that the unmasked bispecific is highly toxic in preclinical models. So our marketing strategy is, we believe, essential for creating a therapeutic window in terms of the toxicities, we're looking to mitigate EGFR antibodies are well known to cause rash and gastrointestinal side effects. And so we've been specifically looking at looking out for our masking strategy to really limit serious EGFR toxicities, particularly Grade three and above. With regard to CD. three. Our marketing strategy is, of course, designed to limit CRS, and I can't before handing over to Wei away. Let me review the high-level goals and achievements to date for our Phase one study of CX. nine and four, given the really high potency of T cell engagers and the widespread expression of EGFR gone above one for this study has been to evaluate the safety of nine oh four and we've made excellent progress. As you will see from Wayne's presentation, we've explored non step and step dosing. We were very pleased to see very limited CRS with nonstop dosing, we believe because of successful CD. three Mascot and in step dosing cohorts rather remarkably, we've seen no CRS at all. We've also seen no evidence of IKON's at any dose level or scheduled. Furthermore, while we have seen some EGFR toxicities, these have been manageable and have not limited us in achieving therapeutically active doses. Again, this shows the success we believe of our EGFR marketing strategy and the success of each of our marketing is consistent with our prior published work. But I mentioned earlier Goal number two of our Phase one study has, of course, been to look for initial signs of antitumor activity. As we've said in recent months. Any evidence of tumor stabilization or tumor shrinkage in this first-in-man study will be very encouraging. I want to emphasize that the patient population we've enrolled to date in this Phase one study is heavily pretreated and is a range of tumor types and is unselected for EGFR mutant. All that said, we're delighted to announce today very encouraging early signs of anti-cancer activity for nine oh four, including confirmed resist responses in pancreatic cancer, a very difficult-to-treat tumor type that is not typically responsive to EGFR inhibition or for that matter to immunotherapy. Moreover, our initial assessments of pharmaco dynamics are supportive of the mechanism of action of CX nine oh four as a mass T cell engager providing crucial platform proof of concept with read through, we believe, to the many other programs we're working on as Cytomedix. Importantly, this Phase one study is ongoing. We're continuing to dose escalate and enroll multiple tumor types, but our next goal is to determine the recommended Phase two dose and to define plans for Phase Ib expansions. We see the data that we're sharing today as a very promising initial step in the development of CX nine oh four, and this work positions Cytomedix at the forefront of the T-cell engager field. Now let me hand over to Wayne to review the data in some detail."", 'Wayne Chu', ""Thanks, Sean, and thanks, everyone, for the opportunity to share our early clinical and translational observations in the ongoing dose escalation study. This slide summarizes the dose escalation scheme key eligibility criteria and study objectives. Patients with tumors with known EGFR expression were enrolled. However, patients were not selected based on EGFR expression. Dose escalation was initiated using a non step dosing schedule in which CX. nine oh four was dosed once every two weeks. Doses starting from seven micrograms through six milligrams were tested. As we will discuss in the subsequent slide dose escalation of CX. nine oh four continued using a step dosing schedule with an initial target dose of five milligrams. Various dosing schedules were tested after which the target dose was administered every two weeks. The data presented today represents safety and efficacy data from a total of 13 dose escalation cohorts through the 10 milligram target dose. And as Sean mentioned, dose escalation continues with the current enrollment testing 15 milligram target dose selected baseline characteristics for enrolled patients are shown in this slide. The majority of patients enrolled in nonstop dosing escalation cohorts were those with microsatellite stable or MSS colorectal cancer, which I will from CRC from here on out, which has been demonstrated to be unresponsive to immune therapies such as checkpoint inhibitors with step dosing would step dosing escalation cohorts. We have begun to focus on patients with tumors with early evidence of clinical activity as well as other tumor types with known EGFR expression. As is typical for a Phase one first-in-human dose escalation study, patients had advanced late-line disease enrolled. Patients received a median of four prior cancer therapies. Many were refractory to their last prior therapy and a considerable proportion received prior EGFR and our PD-1 and PD-L1 directed therapy. Early clinical pharmacokinetic data from the non step dosing schedule was consistent with the CX. nine oh four Probody T-cell engager design. The graph on the left shows that total CX nine oh four exposure increases linearly with increasing dose, indicating no apparent change in dose-dependent clearance or evidence of target mediated drug disposition. The graph on the right shows the cycle one PK profile of CX nine oh four at the three milligram dose level the three curves shows circulating analyte concentrations of intact or mast CD. three, Intact EGFR and total Probody. Notably, the three curves are essentially superimposable indicating that CX. nine or four exists in circulation and predominantly intact or match form preliminary estimates of CX nine oh four half-life, our between 2.8 and 5.3 days. This slide summarizes treatment related adverse events observed with CX nine oh four and the non step dosing schedule. It is important to mention that during this CX nano for escalation, no cortical steroids or other prophylactic medication was administered for systemic toxicities such as CRS. and I can's the safety and tolerability data shown here with non step dosing, therefore reflect the ability of the masking to mitigate CRS. And I can with that, the virtual absence of CRS. and I. cancer is quite striking through the three milligram dose level, no CRS or I can't of any grade were observed even at the six milligram dose level where two patients had dose limiting toxicity of grade three to sites to tennis synovitis and Grade three rash no patients experienced, I can't have any grade. And only Grade one CRS characterized by transient fever without any other signs or symptoms associated with CRS was observed low grade musculoskeletal adverse events such as our Roger and arthritis were observed. In addition to the one grade three tenants synovitis at the six milligram dose level, musculoskeletal events overall appear to be associated with a dose-dependent increase in circulating IL-6. As shown in the graph. This is in direct contrast with CRS, where the association with circulating IL-6 levels was much less evident. Similarly, except for the grade three rash observed at the six milligram dose level, only grade one rash was observed. Overall, the data presented here quite convincingly demonstrate the benefit of masking up on effectively eliminating CRS and I can't which constitute dose-limiting toxicities with many T cell engagers based on the observations during dose escalation on the non step dosing schedule, which demonstrated that CRS. and items are effectively mitigated by the masking of CX. nine oh four step dosing schedules and tocilizumab prophylaxis for you specifically to mitigate emerging musculoskeletal adverse events, maintain a broad therapeutic index and allow continuation of escalation to higher and potentially more efficacious target doses. These measures enabled escalation to higher CX nine of our target doses while continuing to maintain an acceptable safety and tolerability profile. Impressively, no CRS or icons of any grade was observed. Moreover, the incidence and severity of musculoskeletal adverse events did not substantially increase with higher CX nine oh four target doses, no related grade three rashes were reported and no treatment related adverse events resulted in CX nine oh four treatment discontinuation. Overall, the safety profile of CX nine oh four continues to be favorable. And importantly, enable CX nine afford administration and management of adverse events in an outpatient setting. In this regard per protocol, no mandatory hospitalization is required for monitoring a clear dose levels and the safety profile observed to date has not necessitated a change to this practice in the context of a favorable safety profile, we observed compelling signs of CX nine or for anti-tumor activity, highlighted by activity observed to date in patients with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The responses observed with CX nine oh four are highly encouraging given that outcomes in patients with recurrent metastatic pancreatic cancer remain extremely poor with current available therapies. Shown here is the waterfall plot of six efficacy evaluable patients treated across a range of target doses on both nonstop and step dosing schedules confirmed partial responses per resist. 1.1 criteria were observed in two of the six patients, one was treated with six milligrams on a nonstop dosing schedule and had an 83% reduction in measurable tumor burden. And a second patient was treated on a step dosing schedule with a target dose of five milligrams had a 51% reduction in tumor burden. Furthermore, of note, all six patients had disease control of the six patients to remain on study treatment, and we will now discuss these patients in greater detail. The first case describes a confirmed partial response in a 49 year old patient with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Prior therapies included surgery, radiation therapy and three lines of prior chemotherapy. Patient received CX nine oh four on a STEP dosing schedule with 1.5 milligrams administered on day one and the target dose of five milligrams administered one week later and then two weeks thereafter, every two weeks thereafter, patients had not experienced cytokine release syndrome or I can't the patient experienced grade three related arthralgia but this resolved to Grade one after one cycle delay and administration of cortical steroids. As shown in the CT scan images, the patient achieved a partial response with deeper reduction in tumor burden to serve as the confirmatory CT scan. And as I mentioned, this patient remains on CX nine oh four treatment having received over three months of treatment to date. This next case illustrates durable stable disease with CX. nine oh four and a 59 year old patient with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma who have received three prior lines of systemic chemotherapy patient received CX nine oh four on a stepped dosing schedule with 1.5 milligrams administered on day one five milligrams on day eight and 10 milligrams on day 15. Every two weeks thereafter. Patient tolerated CX nine oh four treatment well with no CRS, I can't or musculoskeletal events and only grade one popular pustular rash, which resolved with topical treatment patient was able to maintain stable disease with no evidence of measurable tumor growth and additional information supporting continued clinical benefit included a greater than 50% reduction in serum CA 19 levels and overall improvement of performance status from baseline. This patient remains on CX nine oh four treatment having received over 3.5 months of treatment to date. Preliminary translational data indicates T-cell pharmacodynamic activity that is consistent with the mechanism of action of CX nine oh four and pancreatic adenocarcinoma figure on the left is an immunofluorescence image from a biopsy obtained prior to CX nine for treatment in a patient with pancreatic cancer who achieved a deep partial response. The colors indicate T cell markers in red, dark blue and Magenta and cancer cells in light blue. And as you can see, the pretreatment biopsy showed a high level of CD8 positive T cells within the tumor microenvironment, indicating their contribution to T cell engagers anti-tumor activity. The figure on the right shows the reduction of peripheral CD8 positive T cells as it relates to resist 1.1 response, both pancreatic patients with confirmed partial response had among the greatest reduction of peripheral CD8 positive T-cells following CX nine oh four treatment, consistent with the trafficking of T cells from the periphery to tumor sites as a mechanism of action of T cell engagers, taking a step back from the early but compelling activity of CX nine oh four in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma shown here is the waterfall plot for efficacy evaluable patients treated with CX. nine oh four target doses greater than or equal to 0.75 milligrams. While no objective responses were observed in patients with other tumor types. Reductions in measurable disease burden were observed in a total of eight patients, including the two pancreatic cancer patients with partial responses. Reductions in measurable disease burden were also observed in patients with CRC, esophageal carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer. We believe that the early signals of CX nine oh four activity in pancreatic cancer are compelling and that currently tested target doses are efficacious. As a result, study enrollment moving forward, in addition to continuing to enroll patients with pancreatic cancer will focus on patients with other EGFR-positive tumor types, including lung cancer, upper GI cancers and head-and-neck cancer. This slide summarizes the time on study treatment for patients treated with CX nine oh four, again, highlighting the patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma that continue to derive clinical benefit with ongoing CX nine oh four treatments. Importantly, while CX Sino-Forest has had minimal clinical activity to date in patients with CRCCX. nine oh four retains its pharmacodynamic activity as illustrated in this slide, which are immunofluorescence images of biopsies taken from a patient with MSS CRC at baseline. And while on CX final four treatments as you can clearly see at baseline, the tumors tumor is notable for the almost complete absence of CD8-positive T cells within the tumor. In contrast, the on-treatment biopsy showed a substantial increase in the number of CD8 positive T cells within the tumor. This observation is a clear demonstration of the CX. nine oh four mechanism of action and demonstrates potential combinations strategies for the treatment of CRC. In summary, we are very encouraged by this early clinical data of CX nine oh four in the ongoing Phase one dose escalation CX nine oh four has a favorable safety profile, which given the broad expression of EGFR in normal tissues in addition to cancers is indicative of the ability of masking to maintain a meaningful therapeutic index. Second, CX nine oh four has promising early efficacy and pharmacodynamic activity, highlighted by the confirmed partial responses in patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma and early demonstration of CX nine oh four mechanism of action, including in colorectal cancer, clinical and translational observations have been extremely valuable in demonstrating not only the early clinical activity of CX. nine oh four, but also provide clear direction to plans to ultimately determine the recommended Phase two dose. And this includes continued enrollment in pancreatic cancer and enrollment in other EGFR positive tumor types. Data also is more responsive to immune therapies paid based on prior clinical experience. Together, these data will inform future development of CX nine oh four, which include considerations of combination strategies. And with that I will now turn it back to Sean for concluding remarks."", 'Sean McCarthy', ""Great. Thanks, Wayne. So I'm staying with CS 94 for a moment. We're excited by our progress to date, developing this very novel drug candidate. Egfr is such a high potential target with expression of many tumor types. And we're just at the beginning of learning what six nine zero four can do for patients. We clearly have a drug candidate with confirmed monotherapy activity, and we're redoubling our efforts to generate data in additional tumor types as we more broadly explore nine or four ideas also unlocks potential strategies for future combinations. As we mentioned, focusing for a moment on pancreatic cancer, this is one of the greatest areas of unmet need in oncology today, and it's notoriously difficult to treat. Second line response rates are in the single digits and PFS and overall survival just a matter of months to reiterate the importance of our data shared today, pancreatic cancer does not respond to either anti EGFR antibodies or to immunotherapy alone. What we have shown today is that when we combine these two powerful strategies in bispecific form enabled by our Probody masking technology. We can elicit meaningful responses in late-stage pancreatic cancer patients since 94 brings these two mechanisms together into an integrated and unique pharmacology that could impact this very difficult-to-treat disease showing how mast Probody T-cell engagers can be a new frontier in the war on cancer. These results are the embodiment of exactly what CX nine oh four was designed to do and we plan to aggressively pursue this signal for the better for the benefit of people afflicted with this devastating tumor type. Now, zooming back out to our full pipeline and looking ahead to the rest of this year and also into 2025, we anticipate a great deal of additional progress at Cytokinetics. We see the data we're sharing today are known for as a promising initial step in developing this asset and also our T cell engager portfolio. Overall T-cell engagers are starting to break through in solid cancers and is exciting to be playing our part here at Cytomedix in this highly promising field, not only with NATO for, but also the many T cell engager programs. We're advancing through preclinical discovery and development, and we look forward to providing an additional C NATO for updates later this year. Now, of course, today's update has been very low for focus but before I wrap up, I'd like to remind everyone to also keep our other programs in mind. We're making a lot of progress on multiple fronts. CX. two zero five one and CH. eight oh one, our wholly owned assets, and we anticipate Phase Ia data for both in 2025. We're already in our second Phase one cohort with 2051 must and yet can ADC and clinical initiation for six eight zero one Ahmass interferon is imminent. I'd like to close by thanking everyone involved in this work for their commitment to our vision. The Cytokinetics team is intensely focused on delivering an innovative pipeline for the benefit of people living with cancer, and it's truly a privilege to work with such a talented team. I also want to sincerely thank the patients who join our studies, their families and our investigators. And with that, operator, let's go ahead and open up the call for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Peter Lawson, Barclays.', 'Peter Lawson', ""Thank you so much. Thanks for sharing the data. I'm really excited the mask and benefit you've seen. Do you think that can also extend to other T cell engagers and then the responses you've seen so far and do you think is something special about pancreatic cancer? Or do you think you can get deeper responses in other tissues as well?"", 'Sean McCarthy', ""Hi, Peter. Great. Great questions. Thanks. And regarding that the extension and the read through to other programs, we're obviously very optimistic that that will be the case. You got to start somewhere in nine oh four, I think is a very strong start for us. We've learned a lot with this one in the clinic and as we mentioned, both internally and with our with our partners, we're doing a lot of work in T-cell engagers. We've got multiple programs. In fact, the majority of our partnered work is in T cell engagers so we would expect to make substantial additional progress here over the next few years. In terms of pancreatic, I think it's a great question. It's been interesting to see them.You know, we've done a lot of thinking about this. Obviously, in pancreatic is typically thought of as an immunologically cold tumor or an immunologic desert, if you like. But actually evidence is beginning to mount suggesting that that might not be the case. If you look at the Roche BioNTech on the vaccine data, most recently updated at ACR is really interesting. It suggests that there are some neoantigens in pancreatic cancer that there is some immunologic microenvironment. It looks like with this combination of each well, there's also EGFR, of course there, but no one's been able to break through with an anti EGFR directed therapy. So we think that could be something very unique about EGFR and CD3 in this particular tumor type. But absolutely, it does not indicate that others would not respond to nine oh four. We're still very early in this study. As Wayne mentioned, the the colorectal data is interesting is it is there or MSS. patients that we've shown today.Does it does it does another cold tumor? Some not a lot of progress has been made with T-cell engagers yet in CRC so we would be looking to combination strategies there. As far as the other tumor types are concerned, it's just very, very early days, for example, like outside lung, where we had two patients in the dose escalation study to date, one of those was treated at a very low dose. So probably not relevant. We really just haven't done the experiment yet. So we're going to keep enrolling across multiple tumor types in Phase 1a as we continue to pursue both the pancreatic signal and and define the activity of the drug across hopefully multiple tumor types over time."", 'Peter Lawson', 'Thank you. And then, Steve, the depth of the responses is that correlated with EGFR expression was it tumor microenvironment?', 'Wayne Chu', ""So one thing we have not shown was up this shown in this presentation, but we continue to evaluate is the level of EGFR expression as assessed by immunohistochemistry assay, and we've been doing this on a retrospective basis for all the patients that have enrolled to gauge based on our early data with EGFR by this IHC assay, we have not seen a clear association between EGFR expression and the left and the depth of the response. And just as an example, on the two patients in pancreatic cancer, whilst we had a confirmed partial response, one patient had a moderately high level of EGFR expression by IHC. But then the other the other patient had a very low level of EGFR expression. And it's actually the patient who had the 83% reduction and measurable tumor burden that had the low level of EGFR expression. Interesting, but a more more word, yes, more work to be done there, but some that, Peter, a lot of it depends also on the assay itself. So we'll continue to look at that relationship."", 'Peter Lawson', ""I'll get back into the queue. Thank you so much."", 'Operator', 'Roger Song, Jefferies.', 'Roger Song', ""Great. Congrats for the data and thank you for taking my question and a few questions from us on the first one related to that, those relationship seems the are the efficacy or antitumor PBT is not clearly collared with the dose level. My question is how do you think about as you dose higher even beyond TIM AG. Now you're at the 15. How do you think about the balance between the efficacy and the? Not? Yes, I can't say more. These three are EGFR related tolerability profile. How how confident you are you can keep dosing higher? Thank you."", 'Sean McCarthy', ""Yes, thanks, Roger. Let me kick that one off year. I'd say I think that there is a dose response in the that the responses that we're seeing, the confirmed resist responses. We've seen a five and six milligrams of remember that we began this dose escalation at seven micrograms. So, you know, the range of doses where we're seeing activity is actually really consistent with our from our predictions and for modeling of where the biologically effective range would be. So we think we're in the zone. We do believe, however, because of the safety profile, we can dose higher and whether that will help or not, I don't think we know, I think all of us in the T-cell engager field are kind of trying to figure this out. And if you look at Amgen's tireless I-Mab, I mean, they were all the way to 100 and concluded in the end that 10 milligrams was the dose to move forward because 100 didn't give significant additional efficacy. So I think we want to learn more, but we're ready. I'm very encouraged that we have this clean safety profile with EGFR, I guess, exceeded our expectations. It will allow us to dose escalate further and we will do that and we'll see where it takes us."", 'Roger Song', 'Got it. And my follow-up question is related to your partner and Jim, so this data have you share with them with the partner and if so, any initial feedback? And also understanding you well on giver it update by the end of the year, what you are looking for in order for both of you two parties to make the Phase Ib study design decision.', 'Sean McCarthy', ""Yes, great questions at. So with Andrew and let's take a little step back and talk about just recap the the of the agreement that we have with Amgen. So we're obviously running Phase Ia study and we do share data with them as it emerges. And we are also responsible for running the Phase Ib once we get that up and running. And the transition from Phase one to Phase Ib is a decision that we'll take jointly with Amgen and of course, the goal would be to in Phase Ib to enroll specific EGFR positive tumor types or which one now quite obviously would be pancreatic. We would resume based on this very exciting signal that we've seen. And so we because we are on the way that enrollment has unfolded yet, we still have just not enrolled many patients in lung or head and neck. For example, we do want to bring in a few more patients, get some additional experience in those tumor types before we have the conversation with Amgen later in the year about what the Phase Ib strategy would be. So the update later this year could be a couple of things that could be done additional data from which we would ballpark we should have by end of year another 10 or so patients of data. And it could also be an operational update that we've agreed with Amgen on the next steps and we just have to have that dialogue with them. But in terms of their perspective on the data, I think has a question best asked of them at this point in time. But obviously, we're we're really excited by our progress. Excellent."", 'Roger Song', ""Thank you. You're welcome."", 'Operator', 'Joe Catanzaro, Piper Sandler.', 'Joe Catanzaro', ""Thanks for taking my questions and exciting data here. I guess maybe first one on the EGFR mediated tox that you're seeing. I guess my question is like what do you think is happening? Is that some small amount getting unmasked in periphery or maybe a small amount getting unmasked in the tumor and then reentering circulation? And is that tox that you're seeing typical of sort of historical EGFR experience a cetuximab? Or is there anything indicative that it's T cell targeting of EGFR on normal tissue? Thanks. And I may have one follow-up?"", 'Sean McCarthy', ""Yes, Joe, thanks for the question, um, the um, what first of all, let me say that we're really, really pleased with the very low incidence of Grade three rash in this study, we only have one patient over the 35 patients with a grade three treatment-related rash, and that's a significant achievement. We think come because this unlocks the opportunity to use this mechanism. It just requires that otherwise couldn't be sure exactly whether the Gevaert. So we're very, very pleased about that. Obviously, early days more work to do. But but we're encouraged and, you know, with any drug, you're going to see some you're going to see AB's. It's very hard to say what are they where they're coming from? Is that local is a systemic, we don't know. And we may never know in a way, might not matter that much because it's all about the risk benefit profile. And we're obviously delivering something we think we have very important if it did at least initially for patients with very late-stage pancreatic cancer. I would say it on the type of rash that we see in cetuximab. Rashes is typically the acne form rash. We are we see some of that grade one grade two there also, as Wade mentioned, macular popular rashes, which we have maybe more T cell evolve T cells and deciding we're going to have to learn more about it, but we're not worried about it because it's mostly grade one two, if I look across the entire study. The incidence of rash across the entire 35 patients was 40% on OpEx, just about all grade one, two and manageable. So we're really encouraged by the AE profile here, not to mention the CRS profile, which really quite frankly surprises to the upside."", 'Joe Catanzaro', ""Yes, I think that that's helpful like me and my follow-up for the pancreatic cancer patient that had that deep response and and then subsequent progression, wondering if you could maybe elaborate a little bit more on that progression event on? Was it a new lesion growth of a target lesion? And if it was a new lesion, maybe you're able to sort of profile it and see what's going on. Just anything you could say there? I guess would be would be interesting."", 'Wayne Chu', 'Yes, I can provide some details on that on. This is a patient that dumb, but with the six milligram not SubQ dosing, had a confirmed partial response does present a strikingly with over 80% reduction in measurable tumor burden. The patient did progress based on growth of the target lesion from the nadir as well as the appearance of, I think of one new new target lesion, a non sorry, one new lesion. So that was the nature of the progression on that particular patient. But all through that frame, Tom McCourt, the patient did quite well clinically. It was just based on the radiographic progression there.', 'Joe Catanzaro', ""Okay, thanks. And maybe if I could just squeeze in one more quick one. Maybe going back to an earlier question, just if you could maybe speculate more on what you think it may be going on in MSS CRC. It seems mechanistically like you're seeing T cell infiltration, but that's not translating to tumor reduction. So I'm wondering if you have any other sort of hypotheses of what may be going on in those patients?"", 'Sean McCarthy', ""Yes. I think mechanistically, it's really interesting when we think about how T cell engagers work overall, right? The CD. three arm, CD. three, combined with the tumor antigen, we think at these typically is being MHC. non-restricted mechanisms that may very well very well be what's going on, but that could be they could be more than necessary to really mount an antitumor response. I think we're in again in the field. I think there's more to be learned about specifically how CD. three T cell engagers kill cancer cells. Clearly we're doing it in pancreatic cancer. We're getting the T-cells there in CRC, but it draws one's attention to thinking about what combination strategies could get you to actual objective tumor responses so I think more work to do there and some of the basic science and then also clinical work that we can do in terms of clinical combinations is quite intriguing."", 'Joe Catanzaro', 'Yes, okay. Thanks. Thanks for the update, and thanks for taking my question.', 'Sean McCarthy', 'You bet.', 'Operator', 'Etzer Darout, BMO Capital Markets.', 'Etzer Darout', ""Thanks for taking the question. Just, Dan, if you could maybe talk through on your current thoughts on sort of the STEP versus the nonstop dosing, particularly in the pancreatic arm, Coca-Cola patients that sort of had a response and how you're kind of thinking about potentially moving one or the other option forward as you sort of expand on the patients. And then I don't know if you said this specifically, but about sort of the EGFR expressions across sort of the patients and that that you've seen so far is it that you're going to moving forward, you will look at EGFR expressions? Or is there an opportunity to kind of look at EGFR expression across the folks that you have already sort of enroll in the study. I don't know if I caught that correctly. Thank you."", 'Sean McCarthy', ""Yes, thanks. Thanks answer. In terms of moving forward, which type of loans that we obviously haven't made a decision on that yet. But I would say based on our experience to date, we are more likely that our fees, 1B doses will be set as strategies because it's allowing us to get to significantly higher target doses. And we do think there's a dose response here of sorts. So more to be learned, there will also likely take when you think about Project Optimus considerations will likely want to take more than one dose and schedule into Phase Ib to gain further experience of the drug candidate, not only in pancreatic, but also at other in other tumors as well in terms of EGFR and is surprising actually how on earth, how should I put this the available assay for EGFR assays to EGFR. But I see let's just say it's not perfect. And so we're not sure how much one would want to rely on it moving forward, particularly because it doesn't seem from our early data that this is a straightforward yield, ADC type thing where you have high target is required for activity, yes, these drug drugs like T cell engagers just up would be predicted to be active at low target levels because of the mechanism of the amplified mechanism of tumor killing one T cell can kill multiple GMSL. So I think we've got more to learn there. And that's why we're where we may not be needing or leveraging EGFR selection on a go-forward basis based on what we've seen so far."", 'Etzer Darout', 'Got it. Thank you.', 'Sean McCarthy', ""You're welcome."", 'Operator', 'Anupam Rama, JPMorgan.', 'Anupam Rama', 'Hey, guys. How are you and thanks so much for the data update. Can you comment was there anything in the baseline characteristics, number of prior treatments?', 'Wayne Chu', ""I think the PDX case study that you said was three lines of therapy or otherwise that might be predictive of a response. I think based on the first question, EGFR expression didn't correlate."", 'Anupam Rama', ""And then can you comment in I'm sorry, if I missed this, the other three stable disease patients, what was their duration?

That said, we showed a slide of on a pretreatment biopsy of a patient where with pretty high levels of pretreatment, CD8-positive cytotoxic T cells, which is intriguing that it certainly could have contributed to the risk to the response. And so on that, that's a that's something that we have observed. We don't have that data systematically across the whole study.

Or how are we seeing those tumor reductions evolve? Yes.', 'Sean McCarthy', ""But I mean, it's early days. I think that those that those eight patients that were treated with pancreatic patients and you can see them in the waterfall plot.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in NRG. I'm joined this morning also by Bruce Chung, our Chief Financial Officer. And we also have members of the management team on the call who are available to answer questions. Let's begin with the three key messages for today's presentation on Slide 4. First, our business performance exceeded expectations in the first quarter. I'm incredibly pleased with our strong start to the year and in reaffirming our 2024 financial guidance ranges. Second, electrification trends compounded by GenAI data center growth forecast a signal of transformative rises in power demand. As a result, we expect competitive markets to realize outsized benefits driven by business-friendly environments, available resources and the ability to cite projects quickly."", ""Finally, NRG is well positioned to capitalize on tightened supply and demand in our core markets. Our technology-led consumer platform, our diversified generation portfolio, our leading business energy platform and a real estate site portfolio presents a unique opportunity to create significant shareholder value. I'm going to give you visibility into this later in the presentation. Let's move to Slide 5 because I want to share again our value proposition, which may not be familiar to those of you who are new to NRG, and I understand there are several of you on this call. We served nearly 8 million residential customers and operate the second largest C&I energy and natural gas retail business by volume in the United States. Our company sits at the intersection of energy and technology in the home and the grid."", ""We generate significant excess cash well beyond our current business needs, resulting in the financial flexibility to grow earnings while returning significant capital to our shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. The strength of our business and financial outlook has this uniquely positioned to capitalize on what we believe to the beginning stages of an exceptional time for our industry. It's an exciting time for our company, we remain on track to achieve our 15% to 20% free cash flow before growth per share CAGR target, even as our rising stock price means buying shares at higher prices than projected a year ago. Turning to Slide 6. In recent months, we've received numerous questions about the impacts of the forthcoming power demand growth super cycle on the industry and in NRG in particular."", ""Today, I'd like to talk about what we are seeing. Bruce will then discuss the first quarter results later in the presentation. Starting with macro trends. We're seeing clear signs of a step change in the long-term fundamentals of power demand for multiple catalysts. This marks the departure from an extended period of stagnant power demand during which energy efficiency outpaced usage growth. For the first time in decades, and perhaps in my 40 years in this business, we are experiencing fundamental improvements driven by demand rather than commodity prices. We, along with every other forecasting expert I have read, are now expecting a step change in long-term power demand. This increase in demand is attributed to several factors, including electrification, manufacturing, onshoring, LNG, crypto, greater industrial loads and data center growth."", 'Recent advancements in GenAI are compounding and accelerating these factors, leading to the formation of the next power demand super cycle. At the same time, the U.S. power supply that is expected to accommodate this growth will increasingly depend on intermittent resources, which highlights a growing and unprecedented imbalance between dispatchable supply and demand. To be clear, it takes only a fraction of what is being forecasted to not just into this super cycle. And this super cycle will require an all-of-the-above supply approach, including retaining existing generation assets, developing new generation and approaching supply and demand differently through the adoption of technology by shifting large loads, residential VPP and other forms of demand and energy management.', ""This is a transformative opportunity for our sector and for NRG. If you turn to Slide 7, you'll see why competitive markets such as those in which NRG operates are best positioned to realize outsized benefits of this large load growth. It's due to the competitive framework that offers speed to market, affordability and resource availability. We see Texas and portions of the Northeast as the most favorable markets. Texas stands out as it is already a preferred destination for large loans including crypto, LNG and manufacturing onshoring, which all have experienced substantial growth in recent years and are exhibiting strong outlooks on the future. Texas benefits from its business-friendly practices, favorable regulatory environment, tax incentives and large land footprint, positioning it as a winner in the era of generative AI and other large load growth."", ""Furthermore, coupled with our ability to cite projects years faster than in regulated markets and its proximity to main fiber channels, I expect Texas to continue to be a leader in load growth. On Slide 8, I'd like to highlight four of the many key opportunities for value creation that exists across our platform. To leave no doubt, each of these opportunities represents upside to our June 2023 Investor Day growth plan, and it's not relying on potentially transitory subsidies or inflation reduction act funding. First, we are the only company to have residential energy and smart technologies at scale with nearly 8 million customers. We're a trusted provider and have the unique capability to provide novel energy management through our smart home ecosystem, a capability that will be necessary and increase in value in a tightening market."", ""Second, you may not be aware or fully cognizant of the opportunity that it represents, but we are the second largest business-to-business electricity and largest natural gas provider by volume in North America. Beyond selling customers more of our products, we are a leader in premium services. We offer tailored energy management solutions that focus on optimizing and stabilizing energy costs. We're also able to commercially help our customers achieve their sustainability goals. These customers include many of America's largest industrial players in corporations as well as the hyperscalers. Third, our Texas generation fleet mix is a diverse set of assets that enable us to deliver stable supply costs while maintaining insurance for volatility through higher cost units that are not economical in the current year."", 'These uneconomic units are primarily higher heat rate natural gas assets and in recent low-price times may have run for only a few peak hours per year. We primarily use our generation fleet to supply our residential retail portfolio with customer fixed price contracts typically lasting a year or two. As a result, our generation fleet is mostly open 18 to 24 months out. This creates a significant opportunity to swiftly capitalize on rising power prices and rising demand. As the value of our product increases and equally importantly, units that have historically operated only a few hours annually could now see increasing run times and, of course, profitability. Lastly, our real estate portfolio has several potential development sites for co-location of large loads or power plants.', ""We own 21 sites with 21,000 acres at retired and existing generation facilities that generally have existing or access to grid interconnection. They are in competitive markets and given the extreme focus on project speed potentially provide another avenue of value creation. Let's try to unpack each of these a bit. Turning to Slide 9. We operate one of the leading business-to-business power and natural gas platforms in North America. We serve nearly 100 terawatt hours of electricity and almost 1.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas annually. As demand growth scales, we anticipate increasing electric and natural gas sales volumes. Through our business platform, we help large load customers accomplish their intended goals through tailored plans, including stabilizing their energy costs, delivering specific attributes for their sustainability commitments and optimizing their usage through services such as demand response."", 'At heart, these customers are looking for a partner to help them navigate complicated energy markets while minimizing their risk. We stand ready to provide the services they need as a large market participant with a best-in-class commercial operations platform, and a track record of high-quality customer experiences. With respect to data centers, it is still the early days, but we are seeing signs that they are planning to ramp up capacity in the current years. As an anecdotal example, a data center customer approached us about increasing their capacity by 3x at an existing facility in the next 36 months. We are seeing and experiencing demand growth in real time. Moving to Slide 10. Our Texas generation fleet is diverse in technology, age and merit order.', ""We operate 8.5 gigawatts of generation capacity in Texas, supplemented by 1.6 gigawatts of long-term power purchase agreements. We also have 1.5 gigawatts of shovel-ready brownfield projects in development. This strategic diversification across technologies, fuel types and merit orders ensure near-term stability and positions us to capitalize on opportunities from medium- to long-term margin expansion driven by higher power prices. On the right hand of the slide, we provide our Texas generative to changes in around-the-clock power price scenarios. This sensitivity provides insight into our generation portfolio's earnings power as economic generation increases in dike generation becomes not only economic but very profitable. On Slide 11 provide a more detailed look at our Texas generation gross margin sensitivity."", ""This analysis focuses on changes in power prices, assuming flat natural gas pricing and normal weather. On the left side of the slide, we have included Texas around the clock and peak pricing forwards for July 2023 and April 2024, which represents the assumed pricing in our 2024 guidance and are compared to today's forwards. As you can see, ERCOT forward pricing has moved up significantly. The only explanation for this is that the market is starting to reflect increased power demand from large load growth. Also noteworthy is that the curve is no longer backward dated, suggesting a view and a long-term view of sustained tightness in the Texas power market. Building upon last quarter's additional modeling disclosure, on the right side of the slide, we have provided the necessary components to directionally model the gross margin opportunities for our Texas fleet in a dynamic pricing environment."", ""We begin with the 2024 Texas generation base gross margin and include expected hedge positions of nearly fully hedged in year one, roughly half in year two and less than 25% in year three for economic generation, respectively. We have also included an open gross margin scenario, which assumes no hedges. You will observe that our price sensitivity doesn't follow a linear pattern. Units becoming economically viable at different price levels, resulting in disproportionately larger benefits from increases in power prices compared to decreases. With ERCOT forward pricing rising $10 in the outer years on an open gross margin basis, this complies more than $400 million of margin benefit compared to 2024. Assuming we are 25% hedged in the year that, that move occurs, it translates to approximately $350 million of upside compared to 2024, and this is simply the beginning."", 'This sensitivity analysis demonstrates that our portfolio is well positioned to capture significant margin upside in a rising price environment and that the underlying fundamental value of our fleet has materially increased. Supported by our diversified supply strategy, we have the agility and flexibility to leverage these market dynamics and translate them into significant and durable shareholder value. On Slide 12, I want to close by providing details of our site portfolio. Driven by the need for more capacity in the highly valued attributes these sites possess we are incredibly excited about their potential value. We have 21 sites with 21,000 acres of land within competitive markets that are prime locations for new large loads and power plant development, with co-location opportunities both behind and in front of the meter.', 'These sites offer a mix of valuable and critical access to infrastructure, including transmission, interconnection, water, abundance of land and proximity to long-haul fiber networks. Of particular significance to data centers, these attributes offer expedited construction time lines measured in years of time savings. We have established a dedicated team focused on maximizing the value of our site portfolio. When the analysis is complete later in the year, you can expect to hear more information from us regarding the potential for these sites and what would be required to turn them into new capacity, data center locations or behind the meter projects. With that, let me turn it over to Bruce for the first quarter review.', ""Bruce Chung: Thank you, Larry. Turning to Slide 14. Our top decile safety and strong operating performance resulted in first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $849 million, exceeding the first quarter of 2023 by $203 million. This represents a 31% increase in our adjusted EBITDA from the prior year. $150 million of the year-over-year increase was the result of the inclusion of a full quarter's worth of smart home EBITDA. The remaining increase was attributable to outperformance in our East and West segments, driven by lower realized supply costs, partially offset by a slight decline in our Texas region due to mild weather. Our consumer energy and smart home platforms increased customer counts year-over-year by 8% and 6%, respectively."", 'Most notably, we added 35,000 customers from the newly opened Lubbock market in Texas, representing a healthy share of the available customer base. This is a testament to the hard work of our consumer energy team over the past two years to position NRG and its brands as the electricity provider of choice in Lubbock. Similar to 2023, our smart home platform continued to demonstrate strong execution. In addition to growing customer count 6% year-over-year, service margins increased 5% year-over-year, and monthly recurring revenue per subscriber grew 5% over the same period. It is clear that customers recognize the value of our smart home services as evidenced by our growth in the face of various macro headwinds affecting the consumer discretionary sector.', 'Our diversified supply strategy continued to deliver, ensuring that we sustain the level of margin expansion we saw in 2023 while also providing the necessary coverage against potential volatility in the winter months. As we discussed in our last earnings call, our fleet performed well in the first quarter, demonstrating a 12% improvement in our in-the-money availability factor winter over winter. We have taken advantage of the mild winter in February and March to conduct our maintenance activities more proactively, and we feel confident about fleet performance heading into the critical summer months. Next, I would like to highlight some of what we have focused on as an organization through the first quarter as well as what we continue to remain focused on through the balance of the year.', 'During the quarter, we concluded the $950 million accelerated share repurchase program we launched in November of last year. Through that program, we repurchased nearly 19 million shares at an average price of $50.43 per share or almost 10% of the shares outstanding at the time that we launched the ASR. We remain committed to our capital allocation plan, and we are reaffirming our 2024 return of capital amount of approximately $1.2 billion, comprised of our common dividends, which we increased earlier this year and a further $825 million in share repurchases. As Larry discussed, we continue to advance our 1.5 gigawatts of brownfield development in Texas. We will be filing our Notices of Intent for the three projects to the Texas Energy Fund in the coming days, and we anticipate filing formal loan applications in early June when they are due.', 'Our brownfield development portfolio comprised of two peaking plants and one combined cycle project with CODs ranging from 2026 to 2028 is shovel-ready and represents some of the most real natural gas-fired development opportunities in the ERCOT market. We have been developing these projects since 2021 and we believe that the advancements we have made on the permitting and equipment procurement fronts should position these projects at the front of the queue for consideration by the PUCT for funding out of the loan program. Next, we continue to remain on track to achieve our $550 million program of growth and efficiency initiatives across our business platforms. As I mentioned earlier, our consumer platforms continue to drive strong stand-alone growth, and we continue to see positive momentum in our ability to generate more margin per customer.', ""A great example of this is the tremendous progress we've made in selling the Vivint protection plan. We started selling this plan shortly after closing the Vivint acquisition, and to date, we have about 15% penetration of the existing Smart Home customer base or over 300,000 active plans with each plan generating approximately $9 of monthly revenue per customer. Finally, we are reaffirming our 2024 guidance for both EBITDA and free cash flow before growth. We have tremendous momentum in both our consumer and business platforms and the measures we are taking in our diversified supply strategy should set us up well for the balance of the year. Turning to Slide 15 for an updated view of our 2024 capital allocation. As you can see from the slide, there have been no substantial changes since our last earnings call in terms of the quantum of capital allocated to liability management and capital return."", 'As you may recall, we had planned $500 million of debt reduction in our last earnings call as part of the 2024 capital allocation plan. As you can see from the slide, that has changed slightly given our efforts in Q1 to address our outstanding convertible notes. Through April 30 we repurchased $343 million of the outstanding principal of the convertible notes, resulting in $257 million of additional premium paid to retiring noteholders. Given the cash allocated to settle the convertible note premium, that reduced our net debt reduction to $243 million planned for the year. Our strong share price performance over the past year made the convertible notes one of the most expensive pieces of paper in our capital structure. Therefore, we believe that made the most economic sense to pursue a retirement of that instrument before it would get even more expensive as our share price continues to reflect our fair value.', 'Moving a few columns over to the right, you will see that the share repurchase column is $865 million versus the $825 million we showed in our last earnings call. The reason for that is because we now include $40 million of cash allocated to settle tax matters related to our 2023 share repurchases and employee stock compensation plan. This would include the excise tax on share repurchases instituted as part of the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act. Previously, we had bucketed that allocated cash in other categories, but we decided to move those dollars into the share repurchases category in order to more accurately reflect what the cash is being used for. Finally, similar to our last earnings call, we continue to show $41 million of unallocated capital available for allocation in 2024, which we will evaluate the use of as we move along the year.', 'With that, I will turn it back to you, Larry.', 'Dr. Larry Coben: Thank you very much, Bruce. On Slide 17, I want to provide you a few closing thoughts on our 2024 priorities and expectations. We remain laser focused on execution and on delivering on our financial, operational and safety commitments. We are seeing a step change improvement in fundamentals across all of our platforms. We believe that this will put a spotlight on the scarcity of the critical products and services we sell and the durability of that platform. We are uniquely positioned to deliver significant shareholder value for years to come. Again, we are the only company to combine residential, energy and smart technologies at scale, with nearly 8 million customers and the necessary capabilities to create sustainable value through both tightening and loosening power market conditions.', 'We operate the second largest business-to-business electricity and largest natural gas platform in North America, positioning us as a leader in premium services and tailored energy management solutions. Our integrated supply strategy provides incredible capabilities to stabilize near-term earnings while capturing medium- to long-term margin expansion opportunities from higher power prices. And we own a large Latin portfolio with premium attributes for what is to come in the super cycle of power demand. In my 20 years at the Company in over 40 years in power, I have never been more excited about the future of our sector and NRG. The step change in demand should lead also to a change in the depressed valuations for NRG and its peers. These depressed valuations have resulted in double-digit cash flow yields such as ours.', ""This revaluation will be good for NRG and others in our space, and it's very exciting times. I look forward to updating you on our progress along the way. With that, I want to thank you for your time and interest in NRG. We're now ready to open the line for questions."", 'See also', '20 Counties with the Highest Cancer Rates in the US and', '20 Countries with the Highest Rates of Stomach Cancer in the World.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

It is leagues ahead of rivals such as Intel and AMD, which are still looking to cut their teeth in this market. For example, Nvidia is expected to sell $87 billion worth of AI chips this year. AMD and Intel, meanwhile, are expecting to generate $4 billion and $500 million, respectively, from AI chip sales this year.', ""Nvidia is clearly the go-to chipmaker for companies that are looking to train and deploy AI models, as its share of this market illustrates. The stock market has rewarded the company's dominance handsomely, which is evident from the 507% jump in its share price since the beginning of 2023. This stunning rally has brought Nvidia's trailing earnings multiple to 74, which is quite rich if you consider that the Nasdaq-100 index has an earnings multiple of 30 (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks)."", ""There is a solid chance that Nvidia can justify this expensive multiple with tremendous growth going forward. But there is an alternative for investors who are looking for a company that could replicate Nvidia's AI-driven success in a different market and is trading at an attractive valuation right now -- Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM)."", ""Let's look at the reasons why this chipmaker has the potential of becoming the next Nvidia."", 'Qualcomm is the second-largest manufacturer of application processors used in smartphones. The company controlled 28% of this market at the end of 2023, trailing the top-ranked manufacturer MediaTek by 5 percentage points.', ""One may argue that Qualcomm isn't as dominant as Nvidia in its field. However, it wouldn't be surprising to see Qualcomm eventually capture a bigger share of the smartphone processor market thanks to the proliferation of AI-enabled smartphones. On its May earnings conference call when management was discussing the company's fiscal 2024 second-quarter results (for the three months ended March 24), CEO Cristiano Amon said:"", 'In premium and high-tier smartphones, our Snapdragon mobile platforms continue to set the bar for performance and on-device gen AI capabilities. Recently launched flagship Android devices powered by Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 are seeing strong demand globally, especially in China.', ""More specifically, Qualcomm's revenue from chip sales to Chinese smartphone customers increased more than 40% year over year in the first half of the current fiscal year. This impressive year-over-year increase in Chinese revenue indicates that Qualcomm is making solid headway in a country where MediaTek is the leading player, and is aiming to corner 30% of the flagship smartphone market."", 'Qualcomm is looking to build upon its growing prominence in the Chinese smartphone market by bringing on-device AI capabilities ""to a broader range of flagship and high-tier smartphones with the new Snapdragon 8S Gen3 and Snapdragon 7 Plus Gen 3 mobile platforms, launching in the second half of 2024.""', 'All this explains why Qualcomm is expecting its growth to accelerate from the current quarter. The company delivered a revenue increase of just 1% in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 to $9.4 billion. It is forecasting $9.2 billion in revenue in the current quarter at the midpoint of its guidance range, which would be a 9% jump over the same period last year.', 'The company is expecting its earnings to grow at a faster pace of 20% year over year to $2.25 per share in the current quarter. Wall Street would have settled for $2.18 per share in earnings on $9.06 billion in revenue from Qualcomm, but the company is set to go past those expectations thanks to the growing demand for AI-powered smartphones and its improving influence in markets such as China.', ""That's not surprising, as the company's AI-capable smartphone chips are being deployed by leading smartphone OEMs (original equipment manufacturers). Qualcomm is looking to push the envelope in this space by focusing on bringing AI capabilities into mid-range smartphones as well."", 'In all, Qualcomm is setting itself up to make the most of the bustling market for generative AI smartphones, shipments of which are expected to grow at an eye-popping compound annual growth rate of 65% between 2024 and 2027, according to Counterpoint Research.', 'The generative AI smartphone market is currently in its early phases of growth. Counterpoint estimates that these devices will account for 11% of the overall smartphone market in 2024, and then grow to 43% of the market in 2027. Even then, there will be a lot of room for growth in sales of generative AI smartphones as more companies bring these devices to the market.', 'So Qualcomm is doing the right thing by bolstering its portfolio of AI-focused smartphone chips, and it is making nice headway in this market, with marquee customers such as Samsung. As a result, there is a good chance of Qualcomm becoming a bigger player in the smartphone chips market and replicating the success that Nvidia has seen in the AI chips market.', ""That's why investors would do well to buy Qualcomm at its current valuation. The stock sports a price-to-earnings ratio of 24, which is well below the multiples that Nvidia and the broader Nasdaq-100 index command. The forward earnings multiple is also attractive at 19. Moreover, as the following chart shows, analysts have been raising their earnings growth expectations from Qualcomm."", ""All this indicates that Qualcomm is capable of delivering stronger growth in the coming years thanks to lucrative catalysts such as the AI smartphone market, where the company is a key player. That's why investors looking for the next Nvidia should consider buying Qualcomm before this semiconductor stock steps on the gas."", 'Before you buy stock in Qualcomm, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Qualcomm wasn’t one of them.

Apple has been putting its neural engine into processors since 2017 and has previously talked up how it helps power a number of iPhone, iPad, and Mac features for some time.', 'But the M4 unveiling was different, serving as an appetizer for the AI features the company will present at its WWDC event in June, when Apple is widely expected to debut a slew of generative AI-powered software features for its various devices.', 'Apple pointed to a number of the M4’s AI bona fides during the keynote, with vice president of platform architecture Tim Millet specifically noting that the chip is capable of 34 trillion operations per second, a measurement commonly used when describing a chip’s AI performance.', 'Millet also said that the M4’s neural engine is more powerful than any neural processing unit in any AI PC. That’s a direct shot at Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and Qualcomm (QCOM), which are preparing to or are already rolling out their own AI PC chips designed to run large language models on Windows laptops and desktops.', 'Outside of the M4’s AI processing fundamentals, Apple was mum on any substantive discussion of AI software updates. Sure, Millet said that the M4 helps the iPad Pro quickly isolate a subject from its background in a 4K video, but the M2-equipped iPad Air can do the same thing, just a bit slower. All the company had to offer was that the M4 would make AI apps and features run faster and more smoothly.', 'The company also didn’t provide information about the M4’s performance while training or running large language models (LLMs), something that Intel, Qualcomm, and AMD regularly point to as indicators of their chips’ strengths.', 'Still, the fact that Apple gave consumers, and Wall Street, an early look at its AI thinking is important.', 'The company is widely viewed as behind the curve when it comes to the generative AI race, and investors are banking heavily on WWDC serving as Apple’s big AI coming-out party.', 'CEO Tim Cook has been steadily mentioning AI more over the past few months and said during the company’s most recent earnings call that the iPhone maker is investing heavily in the technology.', 'That includes buying up smaller AI firms, and, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, holding talks with both OpenAI and Google about potentially using their large language models to power Apple’s AI experiences.', 'Analysts expect Apple’s generative AI offerings to serve as a catalyst in helping to boost iPhone sales at a time when consumers are increasingly holding on to their phones longer and splashy new features differentiating one generation from another are in short supply.', 'Now, Apple just has to deliver.', 'Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

Research from McKinsey estimates that generative AI could add the equivalent of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually.1', 'But the energy cost of AI and its environmental impact can also be extensive unless our technology approach evolves to effectively tackle these challenges.', ""Current projections vary, but there are startling analyses of generative AI's energy use and its impact on the environment. A peer-reviewed report in Joule projects AI energy use growing to over 85 terawatt-hours annually, more than the usage of many small countries (Ireland is the example given).2 Popular studies, like those from Gartner, paint dire pictures of the environmental impact and the expense of adapting our computing infrastructure to generative AI. Gartner's report predicts that by 2030, AI could consume up to 3.5% of the world's electricity.3"", 'Additionally, data center processing requires cooling, and cooling consumes water. In its latest environmental report, Microsoft disclosed that its global water consumption spiked 34% from 2021 to 2022, an increase that outside researchers tie to AI.', 'It is imperative to find ways to make AI processing more energy efficient and sustainable. But most reports focus almost entirely on the energy used by AI in the cloud and in data centers.', 'Increasing Efficiency by Running AI Models in Devices', 'Generative AI does not have to run exclusively in the cloud.', 'Currently, training a consumer-grade generative AI model requires a massive cluster of AI hardware and the power to run it. A researcher at the University of Washington estimated that training a model like ChatGPT-3 could use up to 10 gigawatt-hours, roughly equivalent to the annual energy consumption of 1,000 U.S. households.4', 'But once an AI model is trained, it can be reduced and optimized to run on a significantly less power-hungry piece of hardware, like a smartphone or battery-powered laptop.', 'For instance, research by analyst firm Creative Strategies5 concludes that Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, a flagship processor for smartphones, is 30 times more efficient than a data center on image generation tasks. For laptop PCs, the same report states that Snapdragon X Elite Compute Platform is nearly 28 times more efficient than running the AI task on the data center.', 'Running AI on local, private devices also saves the expense of sending queries and data across the network (and through the internal data-routing systems at a cloud provider) and sending the answers back.', 'Finally, the limited processing power of local devices, compared to massive resources available to run queries in cloud data centers, enforces a form of AI discipline on AI software companies, app developers and users. Not all generative AI queries require the resources of cloud-based ChatGPT-4 or its equivalent. By reallocating a portion of AI tasks to the edge, we can leverage the benefits of on-device AI processing, which offers efficient computations with minimal power consumption. A balanced strategy, involving a deliberate distribution of AI workloads across the cloud and edge, can enhance performance efficiency and minimize energy consumption.', 'As technology providers begin to distribute generative AI capabilities to personal devices and start to gather data on the economics of various query types and where those queries run, we expect that they will start to surface these calculations for users, allowing people to make individual cost-based decisions about how much AI processing power they consume.', 'Taking Efficient Edge AI Technologies to the Cloud', 'The technology that enables edge devices, such as smartphones and tablets, has evolved to be both powerful and power-efficient. Users expect these devices to be fast, responsive, and capable of lasting a full day on a single battery charge.', ""In fact, modern smartphones have surpassed the power of IBM's Deep Blue supercomputer, which gained fame for defeating chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov in 1997.6 What's even more impressive is that these powerful mobile devices consume significantly less energy than an LED light bulb.7"", 'This remarkable energy efficiency is the result of decades of innovation in the field. Lean computing instruction sets have been developed to process data using fewer operations, while systems-on-chip integrate multiple components into a single chip to reduce power consumption.', 'Such innovations have allowed Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. to deliver record-breaking power-efficient cloud AI processing products. This showcases the significant potential of edge technologies in addressing the energy challenge associated with processing AI models in the cloud.', 'AI might mitigate its own efficiency problems', 'AI tools are well-suited to optimizing complex systems and can be used to reduce energy requirements and environmental impacts.8 There\'s a possibility that AI tools can help offset some of the impacts of human-caused climate change. Research from the Boston Consulting Group says that, ""AI can accelerate climate action by taking climate modeling to the next level, enabling new approaches to climate education, and supporting breakthroughs in climate science, climate economics, and fundamental research.""9', 'At the moment, the world is still gathering data on the environmental costs and benefits of our new AI tools. The recent COP 28 - UN Climate Change conference highlighted these data gaps to an extent. We are heartened that progress is being made and that AI can help; as Microsoft\'s Brad Smith put it, ""You can\'t fix what you can\'t measure, and these new AI and data tools will allow nations to measure emissions far better than they can today.""10', ""In the meantime, it's imperative that we get a better handle on AI's energy use itself, and do what we can to reduce that use - when possible - by running AI models on lower-power devices, and by using models that simply require less power."", 'At Qualcomm, we believe that AI systems should be designed, developed and deployed in a way that is mindful of environmental impact throughout their lifecycle and value chain.

In this article, we’ll introduce three reliable companies with impressive dividend growth streaks spanning more than 50 years.', 'A long track record of increasing dividends is a positive sign for investors for several reasons. First, it reflects the company’s financial stability and predictability. Consistently growing dividends suggest that the business generates steady, reliable cash flows that can support higher payouts over time.

Moreover, these companies have raised and maintained their dividends despite enduring seven recessions over the past five decades, including the Black Monday in 1987, the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, and the Coronavirus Crash of 2020.

The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks the performance of companies with 25 or more consecutive years of dividend growth, has outperformed the S&P 500 since its inception in 2005. According to a report by ProShares, the initial investment of $10,000 made in 2005 in the index could have potentially grown to over $61,000 by March 2021. Moreover, the index has surpassed the broader market in performance during eight out of the ten most significant quarterly downturns since 2005. The report also mentioned that the companies in the Dividend Aristocrats Index have grown their dividends at an annual average rate of 8.3% between 2005 and 2022, compared with a 6.7% annual average dividend growth rate of the S&P 500 companies.', 'Investors have been actively seeking dividend growth stocks because of their capacity to provide consistent and increasing income over time.

The report further mentioned that total dividend increases were $22.7 billion for the quarter, compared with $19.7 billion in the first quarter of 2023. Howard Silverblatt, Senior Index Analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, has given a strong outlook for dividend growth this year, especially for large-cap companies.

Dividend stocks are ideal for long-term investors as these equities have outpaced inflation over the years. Morningstar cited data from Yale University's Robert Shiller and revealed that since 1871, dividends per share in the S&P 500 have increased at an annualized rate of 1.6 percentage points faster than inflation.

The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks the performance of companies with 25 or more consecutive years of dividend growth, has outperformed the S&P 500 since its inception in 2005. According to a report by ProShares, the initial investment of $10,000 made in 2005 in the index could have potentially grown to over $61,000 by March 2021. Moreover, the index has surpassed the broader market in performance during eight out of the ten most significant quarterly downturns since 2005. The report also mentioned that the companies in the Dividend Aristocrats Index have grown their dividends at an annual average rate of 8.3% between 2005 and 2022, compared with a 6.7% annual average dividend growth rate of the S&P 500 companies.', 'Investors have been actively seeking dividend growth stocks because of their capacity to provide consistent and increasing income over time. As corporate balance sheets are showing strength, many companies in the US are steadily growing their dividends. According to the latest data from S&P Dow Jones Indices, the companies in the S&P 500 distributed $151.6 billion in dividends in the first quarter of 2024, up from $146.8 billion during the same period last year. The report further mentioned that total dividend increases were $22.7 billion for the quarter, compared with $19.7 billion in the first quarter of 2023. Howard Silverblatt, Senior Index Analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, has given a strong outlook for dividend growth this year, especially for large-cap companies. Here is what he said:', '“Absent an economic or geopolitical event, dividend growth is expected to selectively continue. S&P 500 large caps appear to be weathering uncertainty and volatility better. The index is expected to post a 6% increase in payments for 2024 compared to its 5.1% increase in 2023 and the 10.8% increase seen in 2022.""', ""Generating income from dividend stocks is not a quick process; it mainly requires patience and a long-term investment approach. Dividend stocks are ideal for long-term investors as these equities have outpaced inflation over the years. Morningstar cited data from Yale University's Robert Shiller and revealed that since 1871, dividends per share in the S&P 500 have increased at an annualized rate of 1.6 percentage points faster than inflation. In addition to this, the advantage of dividend growth over inflation has strengthened in recent years. Over the past 50 years, dividends have surpassed inflation by an annualized rate of 2.5 percentage points, and over the last 20 years, by 4.6 percentage points annually."", 'That said, achieving dividend growth and that too, for such long periods of time, is not an easy task.

Yesterday, after the market closed, we published our first quarter results. As you've seen, we've updated our quarterly earnings format with a goal to enhance our process, provide information to the investors, which they're most interested in. We are happy to take your feedback on our new format as we move forward. As we kick off with some reflections, I'd really like to begin today thanking the entire Goodyear team for delivering on our first quarter ahead of plan. We are fully engaged in executing the Goodyear forward and it is this level of momentum that is going to help us drive towards stronger results, stronger segment operating margins, and stronger free cash flow over the next couple of years."", ""I do want to point out that it's not just what our associates have accomplished. It's also about how they're doing it. We are focused on a very clear set of KPIs to deliver the Goodyear forward, our operating plan, and we have the governance and accountability very clear through our chain. Through my first months here at Goodyear, it is clear our associates are committed to doing the right things and in the right way. This is why the company continues to be one of America's top trusted brands. Since I joined Goodyear just over 90-days ago, it's been inspiring to engage in discussions with our associates in our plants, at our retail centers, at our tech center and headquarter, and all of our stakeholders, as well as I've worked to dive deep into understanding the business and making sure that I'm laser-focused together with the team to execute our Goodyear Forward transformation, as well as the annual operating plan we have in front of us."", ""We turn to Q1 results. As we look at our results for the first quarter, we delivered segment operating income of $247 million ahead of expectations and nearly doubling our earnings from last year. This reflects a marked recovery in our America's business, with SOI up $100 million from the prior year. Our Asia Pacific business also continued to see significant growth, both in volume as well as earnings. EMEA's results in the quarter were relatively stable, providing a good base for us to grow. All that said, as we see our overall volume softness in the quarter, partly driven by weaker industry members selling volumes, partly due to the very specific actions we're taking to increase profitability on low margin, low value-add products. This is a clear strategy of the Goodyear Forward plan, something that will help us to increase our margins over the next couple of years."", ""It's a focus by product line, profitability and our product should cost analysis which I'll cover more later. And at the end it's always about our execution. Like we've seen over the past several quarters, global consumer replacement industry volumes continue to be influenced by growth in low-end imports in both the U.S., as well as Europe. This dynamic was captured as part of our first quarter outlook. As we look at what is happening at the retail level, industry sellout was up slightly in the U.S. and up about 3% in Europe. In our commercial truck business, and like we've seen over the last several quarters, a weak fleet industry condition continued to weigh on our business in the Americas, as well as the EMEA. For the Americas, while sellout conditions are stabilizing, the industry did see some pre-buy as a result of potential new tariffs on imported tires coming from Thailand."", ""With that said, we don't see this incremental import activity as a significant headwind to our plan. As we turn to Goodyear Forward, we delivered about $70 million in segment operating income improvements during the first quarter. In addition to what we captured in the P&L this quarter, we are executing actions to drive towards our $1.3 billion planned earnings improvement as part of Goodyear Forward. In our footprint and plant optimization, we have put together very detailed plant-specific factory plans. Going to the work center level to drive factory efficiencies across our footprint, we are reviewing the details of these efficiency plans with our plant operating teams together with the leadership team on a weekly basis. In addition, I spent the last month visiting our manufacturing sites in the U.S. to support both these initiatives to get to know our teams and to get to know the folks on our production floor."", ""The work in our factories includes implementing improvements to drive increases in our operating equipment uptime, reliability, reducing the complexity in our factories, reducing the number of configurations, preparing to run several products on common product platforms, as well as rationalizing our materials. We are also working to reduce overtime and third-party contractor spend as we move forward. In addition, we've announced changes to our distribution strategy in Australia, three planned factory closures, two in Germany, one in Malaysia. In purchasing, we're negotiating with our suppliers using clean sheet and shift cost methodologies and analytics, which are aided by tech advancements. We are implementing enhanced spend control standards and control processes to get to a deeper level of visibility, as well as very proactive management of our spend all the way down to the factory level."", ""Given that procurement plays such an essential role in the success of Goodyear Forward, I have elevated the Chief Procurement Officer role to report directly to me on the leadership team. In our SAG areas, we previously announced a reduction of 1,200 positions in EMEA. It will deliver $100 million in savings by 2025. In addition, we've also taken actions on additional 135 positions in the U.S. and LatAm during the first quarter. While headcount reductions of any kind are always very difficult decisions that we can make as a management team, they are in fact required for us to right size our cost structure and enable our long-term competitiveness as a company. In the supply chain and research and development, we continue to optimize for best cost."", ""As I mentioned earlier with respect to margin enhancements, we took actions in the first quarter to increase our price/mix on our lowest margin accounts. At the same time, we are also working to industrialize a number of new products to bring to market and the SKUs associated with that. In the quarters ahead, we're going to broaden our product portfolio with increased premium Goodyear fitments for the high-end market as we continue to rationalize our portfolio and SKU count where appropriate. We continue to be very focused on the Cooper brand as well and continuing to grow in that area. Our retail store network in the U.S. turned in their best first quarter in five years, driven by advancements in consumer insight and the actions we've taken to improve our price and our mix."", ""Overall, as I reflect on the quarter, I am very encouraged with our execution. I'm excited about the improvements that we are driving for the future. And by now, I've been through the detailed makeup of the Goodyear Forward plan inside and out and can confirm that we have the line of sight to the $1.3 billion run rate improvements and 10% segment operating income margin by the end of next year. We'll keep a close eye on the industry volume and price/mix over the next quarters to ensure we're managing the external environment, while we execute our plan to drive value for our shareholders. Now I'll ask Christina to take you through the first quarter financials in greater detail and we'll move on to Q&A. Thank you. Christina?"", ""Christina Zamarro: Thank you, Mark. I'll start by echoing Mark's excitement about the execution we're seeing from our team on Goodyear Forward. With energy carrying throughout our organization, it's clear that the combination of this plan, our team's knowledge of the business, and their ability to drive results sets us up for success. I'll begin with our financial results starting with the income statement on slide eight. Our sales totaled $4.5 billion, down 8% from last year, driven by lower tire volume and unfavorable price/mix. The unfavorable price/mix was due to the impact of two factors. First, a weak commercial truck industry on our mix and second, contractual price adjustments as feedstock prices have remained low over the last several quarters."", 'Unit volume was down 3% from last year. Overall replacement volume declined 7%, partly offset by higher OE volume, which increased about 9%. Segment operating income for the quarter was $247 million, up $122 million from a year ago. After adjusting for significant items, our earnings per share was $0.10, up $0.39 versus last year. The year-over-year drivers of our earnings are shown on slide nine. The impact of lower tier unit volume was $28 million, reflecting a decline in shipments of 1.4 million units. Factory utilization was a slight benefit. Segment operating income benefited from favorable net price/mix versus raw material cost of $127 million. Raw materials were a benefit of $261 million and price/mix was negative for the quarter due to commercial truck mix and contractual pricing adjustments.', 'The negative impact of price/mix was $134 million. Having said all that, sequential pricing from the fourth quarter was stable. Goodyear Forward initiatives contributed $72 million in the quarter with benefits driven by plant optimization and purchasing. Inflation in the quarter was $58 million or about 3%, which was partly offset by favorable other costs of $25 million, driven by lower transportation rates. Other SOI is primarily consist of the impacts from the fire in our Poland facility that occurred in August of last year. Turning to slide 10, net debt totaled $7.4 billion at the end of the first quarter, down just over $550 million from the same time last year. Cash flow from operating activities is typically negative in the first quarter as activity ramps up following the holiday shutdown.', ""Cash use decreased in the first quarter versus a year ago, given lower raw material costs in our inventory and increased earnings. Moving to our SBU results and starting on slide 12, America's first quarter unit volume decreased 7% or 1.5 million units driven by replacement volume. These results are in contrast to the relatively strong U.S. industry in the first quarter, which was driven by an increase in low-end imports. Industry member volume, primarily representing large branded tire companies, was lower year-over-year. Segment operating income totaled $179 million, or nearly 7% of sales, reflecting an increase of $100 million year-over-year. America's earnings benefited from lower transportation rates, the execution of Goodyear Forward, and from net price/mix versus raw materials, which more than offset inflation and volume headwinds."", ""Moving to slide 13, EMEA's first quarter unit volume decreased 5% or 700,000 units driven by replacement. Like in the U.S., Europe's consumer replacement industry growth in the first quarter was driven by imports. Our premium segment share remained stable versus prior year. Segment operating income was $8 million and flat from a year ago. Favorable net price/mix versus raw materials and Goodyear Forward actions were offset by volume declines and inflation. Turning to Asia Pacific on slide 14, first quarter unit volume increased 10% or 800,000 units driven by OE growth in China. Segment operating income totaled $60 million and 10% of sales with an increase of $22 million in SOI, compared to the prior year. Asia’s earnings benefited from favorable net price/mix versus raw materials, volume, and Goodyear Forward initiatives."", ""These benefits were partially offset by higher costs. Turning now to our second quarter outlook on the left-hand side of page 16, we expect second quarter global unit volume to be about flat versus prior year. I'll note that this excludes the America's replacement unit volume recovery related to last year's tornado at our Tupelo facility, which I'll cover in SOI other in just a moment. Additionally, we expect higher unabsorbed fixed costs of about $30 million, driven by lower production volume during the first quarter. Lower raw materials will be a benefit of about $160 million, partially offset by about $70 million of lower price/mix, driven by raw material indexed agreements. We expect Goodyear Forward to deliver approximately $75 million of SOI benefits during the second quarter."", ""Lower transportation rates will partly offset general inflation for net headwind of about $10 million in costs. SOI other items to consider include a net benefit of the recovery from the 2023 storm at our Tupelo facility and the continuing impact from the fire at our Poland facility. The combination of these events reflects a net benefit of $35 million in the second quarter. On the right-hand side of the page, our full-year assumptions are relatively unchanged from our previous call, although I'll note we have increased our full-year outlook for Goodyear Forward given our first quarter performance and reflecting our confidence as we move through the execution of our plan. With that, we'll open the line for questions."", 'Operator: [Operator Instructions] I will take our first question from James Picariello with BNP Paribas.

Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.', 'Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.', 'Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month.

Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; Ocular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection, other transplant (including corneal graft) rejection.', 'Infusion-Related ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions.

Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.', 'Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple MyelomaIn trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality.

Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all our SEC filings. And with that, I'll hand it over to Blake."", ""Blake Moret: Thanks, Aijana, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before we turn to our second quarter results on Slide 3, I'll make some initial comments. At a high level, our performance in Q2 was good, but I am not happy with the reduced guidance for the full year. The impact of high inventory levels at machine builders is larger than we expected. Orders are still expected to return to year-over-year growth in Q3 and continue to increase during the year, but the slower ramp is impacting shipments for the second half. Consequently, here's what we are doing. We are accelerating actions to bring costs in line with the revised outlook on current year orders, aligned with the more comprehensive program to expand margins introduced during our Investor Day in November."", ""We will save the $100 million in the second half of this year from accelerated actions being taken now, creating a beneficial starting point for fiscal year 2025. We will see incremental savings of $120 million next year from these actions alone, plus a larger amount of additional savings from the more comprehensive program targeting sourcing, manufacturing and SG&A, and we will provide a more detailed view of this program on our next earnings call. We are improving our forecasting with new perspectives on the team, processes that include a deeper analysis of channel information and better decision support technology. I'm optimistic about our position when we exit fiscal year '24 regardless of next year's growth for several reasons. Rockwell has built an unmatched portfolio to meet the world's growing need for smart manufacturing."", 'Our home market North America is expected to grow faster than the worldwide PAM. We are winning major new business today with both our traditional offerings and new sources of value across discrete, hybrid and process industries. As we couple this with our focus on margin expansion through cost discipline, operational excellence and organic growth, we will achieve the longer range targets introduced in November and create significant shareowner value. Turning to the quarter, as we indicate on Slide 3, we returned to good operational performance in the second quarter with both organic sales and adjusted EPS above our expectations. Sales of product, configured order offerings, software and life cycle services were all at or above our forecast.', 'In products, we converted incoming orders at a much higher level than in Q1, and we now have sufficient mix of safety stock in place to convert orders at the current level or higher through the balance of the fiscal year. We are essentially back to booking and billing product orders in the quarter they are received at pre-pandemic conversion rates. Our orders were up low-double-digits sequentially, with continued recovery across all business segments and regions. North America had the highest sequential increase in the quarter. Year-over-year, total sales were down 6.5% in the quarter based on an organic sales decline of 8% and 1.5 points of acquisition growth. In our Intelligent Devices segment, organic sales declined about 7.5% year-over-year.', ""I'm pleased with our execution to meet our shipping commitments and build safety stock in the quarter for these products. We also continue to see strong performance from our recent Clearpath acquisition, with sales of autonomous mobile robots contributing almost 2.5 points to ITD growth in the quarter. One notable Clearpath win this quarter was with The Hershey Company. The Hershey Company continues to advance digital capabilities to enhance agility and efficiency across its operations, including supply chain and manufacturing processes. As part of their efforts, Hershey has selected Auto Motors Technology to improve productivity in both fulfillment and manufacturing operations. Q2 margin performance for Clearpath was also better than expected."", ""Software and control organic sales were down 23% versus prior year, largely as we expected. As you know, this segment is significantly impacted by difficult year-over-year comparables in our Logix business. In Q2 of last year, we had 42% growth in software and control. There are particularly high levels of these products in inventory at our machine builders. Despite this temporary correction, we are gaining Logix share and winning new business across our software and hardware offerings. I'm proud of the vitality of our product development here, demonstrated by recent organic product launches and partnerships with Microsoft and NVIDIA that are focused on specific customer use cases, especially those that will benefit from simulation and simplification using artificial intelligence."", 'These partners recognize that machines and manufacturing processes represent an enormous largely untapped source of data and petabytes of this data flow through our controllers. They also know we have the manufacturing domain expertise to select the best use cases for their technology. Lifecycle services organic sales grew over 12% year-over-year and continue to outperform our expectations, driven by strong process end markets. Book-to-bill in this segment was 1.07, led by good order growth in our Solutions and Sensia businesses. Our Sensia JV saw another quarter of over 25% year-over-year sales growth in Q2. The Lifecycle Services segment also continues to contribute strong growth from our high value services, including cybersecurity, which saw orders growth of almost 50% in the quarter.', ""We are making substantial progress to expand Lifecycle Services margin. We saw 16% margin this quarter and we're not done working on the performance of this business segment. Total ARR was up 20% again this quarter. We continue to see strong profitable recurring growth from both high value services and software. Rockwell segment margin was 19%. This would have been about 17% without the reversal of the bonus accrual we recorded in the quarter. Adjusted EPS of $2.50 was above our expectations, even after adjusting for the reversal of the bonus accrual. Nick will cover this in more detail later on the call. Let's now turn to Slide 4 to review key highlights of our Q2 industry segment performance. Sales in our Discrete Industries were down high teens versus prior year."", ""The impact of high product inventory levels in the channel are most pronounced in our Discrete and Hybrid Industry segments. Automotive, e-commerce and other warehouse automation sales were all impacted. Within Discrete, automotive sales were down 20%. Much of this year-over-year weakness is driven by excess product inventory in our channel. However, we're also starting to see some impact on our fiscal '24 sales as customers take time to reevaluate the timing of their EV investments. While we are not seeing any EV or battery project cancellations, we are seeing push outs of certain production start dates. As we mentioned, given our strong installed base and expanded portfolio, Rockwell is well-positioned with automotive customers, whether they are investing in electric vehicles or adding more hybrid options in the near-term."", ""They are all interested in increasing efficiency. In addition to our traditional sources of value, Clearpath autonomous mobile robots helped us secure over half a dozen wins with major brand owners and Tier 1 suppliers this quarter. Semiconductor sales declined 25% year-over-year, with continued geopolitical pressures and a temporary oversupply of legacy chips weighing on semi customers' CapEx investments. Our sales in e-commerce and warehouse automation were down high teens this quarter. We did see an improvement in sequential growth and increased our full year sales outlook. We're rebuilding a strong warehouse pipeline with traditional retailers and global shipping and logistics customers. Turning to our hybrid sales. This industry segment was down mid-teens year-over-year."", 'The weakness in this industry segment was led by food and beverage and home and personal care. Food and beverage sales declined 20% in the quarter, driven by slower activity at our packaging OEMs, who are still working through their excess inventory. There are also some signs of slower end user CapEx spend. Food and beverage end users are continuing to fund capacity expansion in emerging markets like India and Southeast Asia and modernization and resilience projects across their existing facilities. We had wins in the quarter, including the AMR project I mentioned earlier and cybersecurity projects at new customers. Life Sciences sales were down high-single-digits. Results in the quarter were mainly driven by project delays, especially in China.', ""Outside of that region, we continue to expand our installed base with newer software and hardware offerings. One example of new value in this vertical was an important Q2 order with an innovative contract manufacturer, National Resilience, who selected Clearpath to provide a comprehensive AMR solution as they bring cell and gene therapies to market. Moving to process, our sales here grew high-single-digits year-over-year, supported by continued strength in oil and gas and mining. Oil and gas sales were up over 20% this quarter, with continued momentum in energy transition projects. In Q2, we secured multiple decarbonization projects, including applications for carbon capture, storage and hydrogen. Let's turn to Slide 5 and our Q2 organic regional sales."", 'The Americas continue to be our strongest region this year, with Latin America growing 8% versus prior year and North America organic sales down about 4% in the quarter. EMEA sales decreased 19% due to high machine builder inventory in Germany and Italy, particularly in consumer packaged goods. Asia Pacific sales declined 17% in the quarter, with sales in China down almost 30% versus prior year. We expect a combination of weaker market conditions and slower distributor destocking to continue to impact our China performance through the balance of this fiscal year. Moving to Slide 6 for our fiscal 2024 outlook. As I mentioned at an investor conference in March, while orders continue to increase sequentially from the trough in Q4 of last fiscal year, we have not yet seen the acceleration we expect once distributors and machine builders work through their excess inventory.', ""The result is that some of the demand they are seeing does not translate to an equal amount of orders placed on Rockwell. I also said that if the pace of orders continued on its current trajectory, we would expect our full year 2024 financial results to track closer to the low end of both our organic growth and EPS range. Since then, we've seen lower than expected order activity. While distributors and machine builders are continuing to work through their excess inventory, we have underestimated the amount of overstock at our machine builders. Based on information received directly from our largest machine builders, our downward revision is based largely on the size of their inventory and the expected pace of the reduction, resulting in a slower ramp of orders in the fiscal year."", ""Again, we do expect to return to year-over-year growth in orders for the third quarter and our updated forecast still implies sequential order growth in Q3 and Q4. We believe we are taking share in our major product lines globally and in the U.S. North America is our strongest market, and we are starting to see an increased order impact from customer mega projects as the year progresses. We now expect our full year orders to be down low-single-digits versus prior year. Based on our performance to date and the lower than expected order ramp, we are revising our fiscal '24 sales guidance range, with organic sales projected to decline 7% at the midpoint, and we continue to expect acquisitions to contribute 1.5 of growth. ARR is still expected to grow about 15%."", 'Segment margin of 20% is now expected to decline versus prior year, which still implies an increase in the second half and specifically in fiscal Q4, driven by higher volume and the accelerated cost down actions I mentioned earlier. Nick will share additional detail in his section. Adjusted EPS is slated to decrease 13% year-over-year at the midpoint. We are increasing planned share repurchases to roughly double our original plan for the year, and we expect free cash flow conversion of 80%. This is a reduction from our prior guide and Nick will cover this in more detail later. The reduced guide for the fiscal year only strengthens our commitment to building a strong foundation for future growth and profitability. The company wide program to comprehensively take cost out of our products and operations will positively impact our results next year.', ""Savings will be used to expand margins and reinvest to drive future growth. We will provide additional detail no later than the Q3 earnings call. Our intention is to manage our business segments for consistent forecastable performance. You've also seen the announcement of Nick's upcoming retirement. A search has been underway, and we expect to announce a new CFO in the coming months. Nick will be fully engaged in the transition to his successor, and he'll now provide more detail on our Q2 performance and financial outlook for fiscal 2024. Nick?"", ""Nick Gangestad: Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. Although my family and I are excited about what comes next in retirement, my continued focus is on delivering our plans for this year and ensuring a smooth seamless transition to a new CFO. I'll start on Slide 7, second quarter key financial information. Second quarter reported sales were down 6.6% compared to last year. Q2 organic sales were down 8.1% and acquisitions contributed 140 basis points to total growth. Currency translation increased sales by 10 basis points and about 150 basis points of our organic growth came from price, in line with our projections. Segment operating margin was 19% compared to 21.3% a year ago. This 230 basis point decrease reflects lower sales volume, partially offset by lower incentive compensation."", ""Adjusted EPS of $2.50 was higher than expectations. Given our lowered outlook for fiscal 2024, we did not accrue any bonus expense in Q2 and we reversed the prior quarter bonus accrual. This resulted in a total adjusted EPS benefit of approximately $0.30 in the quarter. Even without the bonus impact, our Q2 adjusted EPS was ahead of our expectation due to better than expected conversion of incoming orders into sales. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide. Adjusted effective tax rate for the second quarter was 14.8%, below the prior year rate. Free cash flow was $69 million, compared to $156 million in the prior year. Our lower year-over-year free cash flow generation in the quarter was driven by lower pre-tax income and higher tax payments, partially offset by decreases in working capital."", ""The increased tax payments relate to our gain on our sale of PTC shares in fiscal year '23 and our payments on the 2018 TCJA transition tax. One additional item not shown on the slide. We repurchased approximately 700,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $195 million. On March 30, $600 million remained available under our repurchase authorization. Slide 8 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our 3 operating segments. Intelligent Devices margin decreased to 16.5% compared to 20.2% a year ago. The decrease from the prior year was driven by lower sales volume and unfavorable mix, partially offset by lower incentive compensation. Higher sequential margin was driven by better volume and lower incentive compensation, partially offset by mix."", ""Software and control margin of 25.7% decreased from 33.6% last year. The lower margin was driven by lower sales volume, partially offset by lower incentive compensation, positive price cost and favorable mix, driven by higher software sales. Higher sequential margin was driven by lower incentive compensation, partially offset by lower volume. Lifecycle Services margin of 16.6% tripled from a year ago margin of 5.5%. The margin performance was driven by lower incentive compensation, higher sales and higher margins in Sensia. Higher sequential margin was driven by volume, lower incentive compensation, and ongoing improvements in productivity. Lifecycle Services book-to-bill was 1.07, indicating continued strength in underlying demand. The next Slide 9 provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q2 fiscal '23 to Q2 fiscal '24."", ""Core performance was down $1.15 on an 8% organic sales decline. The EPS decline was driven by lower volume and unfavorable mix and was partially offset by positive price cost. Incentive compensation was a $0.55 tailwind. This year-over-year improvement reflects no projected bonus payout this year versus an above target payout last year. The dilution impact from acquisitions was neutral due to better than expected profitability in Clearpath and Verve. The year-over-year impact from tax was a $0.10 tailwind. Let's now move on to the next Slide, 10, guidance for fiscal '24. We are lowering our guidance for fiscal '24. We now expect reported sales to decline in the range of negative 6% to negative 4% and organic sales to decline in the range of negative 8% to negative 6%."", ""As Blake mentioned earlier, we continue to expect acquisitions to add 150 basis points to growth. We now expect currency to contribute about 50 basis points to growth as we are seeing continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We continue to expect price to be a positive contributor to growth for the year. We expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 17%. We are lowering our adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $10 to $11. We now expect full year fiscal '24 free cash flow conversion of about 80% of adjusted income. The lowered expectations for free cash flow conversion is driven by the fact that the positive earnings impact from zero incentive compensation recorded this fiscal year does not result in better cash generation this year."", ""This is because the payout of any annual incentive compensation occurs in of the following fiscal year. Therefore, we will see the benefit of this on our cash flow conversion in fiscal year 2025. From an inventory standpoint, we continue to expect that inventory days on hand will drop to 125 days by the end of fiscal year 2024 compared to the 140 days of inventory we had at the end of fiscal year '23. From a calendarization perspective, we expect mid-single digit sequential order growth in Q3 and high teens sequential order growth in Q4. We expect Q3 sales dollars and segment margin to be lower than Q2 levels. Now that we have largely cleared our product backlog, we are generating most of our product sales from new orders in the quarter, which are ramping up slower than we expected."", ""We expect Q4 to be the highest revenue dollar and margin quarter of the year. From a sequential margin perspective, we expect margins in Q3 to be about 250 basis points lower than in Q2 due to the non-repeat of the bonus accrual reversal that benefited Q2, also lower volume and mix. By segment, we expect our Q3 margins to be up slightly in Intelligent Devices, down significantly in Software and Control due to lower Logix controller sales and flat in Lifecycle Services. As Blake mentioned, we are adjusting our spending level with the lower outlook for this fiscal year. Last quarter, we expected our full year '24 investment spending to increase by $60 million year-over-year or to be up about 2%. We now expect our full year spend to be down approximately $50 million versus prior year."", ""This roughly $100 million spend reduction in the second half of fiscal '24 is driven by a combination of structural and temporary cost out actions, which will help protect our margins in the current fiscal year and will set the right foundation for fiscal year '25 and beyond. Some examples of temporary cost reduction items include not filling open positions, reducing contractor spend, and further reducing our travel and marketing spend for the year. In terms of structural actions, we are expecting about $60 million of restructuring charges related to headcount reductions in the second half of the fiscal year. The expected restructuring charges are excluded from our adjusted EPS. These savings and our continued cost structure optimization are aligned with our longer term productivity focus and profitability targets."", ""A few additional comments on fiscal '24 guidance. Corporate and other expense is now expected to be around $130 million. We're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 114.3 million shares. We expect to deploy between $600 million and $800 million to share repurchases during the year. This is an increase from our prior range of $300 million to $500 million and reflects a higher near term prioritization of returning cash to shareholders versus acquisitions. Net interest expense for fiscal '24 is now expected to be about $135 million. With that, I'll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A."", 'Blake Moret: Thanks, Nick. We are focused on getting synergies and efficiencies throughout the entire organization. The portfolio of capabilities that we have built and bought is second to none, and now is the time to knit all these pieces together. This will help us drive more customer value, efficiency and cost savings, which in turn will yield higher margins and funds for reinvestment. Aijana will now begin the Q&A session.', ""Aijana Zellner : Thanks, Blake. We would like to get to as many of you as possible, so please limit yourself to 1 question and a quick follow-up. Joanne, let's take our first question."", 'See also', '25 States That Have Trouble with Student Loan Payments and', '25 Most Vegetarian Friendly Countries in the World.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

Welcome to The Williams First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I'd now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Danilo Juvane, Vice President of Investor Relations, ESG and Investment Analysis. Please go ahead."", ""Danilo Juvane: Thanks, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us and for your interest in The Williams Companies. Yesterday afternoon, we released our earnings and press release and the presentation that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong; and our Chief Financial Officer, John Porter, who will speak to this morning. Also joining us on the call are Micheal Dunn, our Chief Operating Officer; Lane Wilson, our General Counsel; and Chad Zamarin, our Executive Vice President of Corporate Strategic Development. In our presentation materials, you'll find a disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to our remarks, and you should review it. Also included in the presentation materials are non-GAAP measures that we reconcile with generally accepted accounting principles. And these reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the day's presentation material. And with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong."", ""Alan Armstrong: Okay. Well, thanks, Danilo, and thank you all for joining us today. Well, another first quarter and another strong start for Williams. So let me begin here on Slide 2 by calling out a few operational financial and strategic achievements we saw this first quarter. Starting here on the left of this slide, Yet again, we've set a record for contracted transmission capacity led by Transco, the largest and fastest-growing natural gas pipeline. And in January, we closed on our acquisition of a portfolio of Natural Gas Storage assets from an affiliate of Hartree partners for approximately $1.9 billion. The transaction included 6 underground natural gas storage facilities located in Louisiana and Mississippi, making us the largest owner of storage on the Gulf Coast."", ""Demand for natural gas has greatly outpaced natural gas storage capacity since 2010. And our thesis of this underinvestment is now being realized as this newly acquired storage is being re-contracted at rates above our acquisition expectations. In fact, storage rates have reached the point of supporting Brownfield expansions, and we are gauging interest from customers willing to underwrite potential expansion of these facilities in the form of long-term contracts. Also in the first quarter, we announced the expansion of the Southeast Supply Enhancement project to roughly 1.6 Bcf a day of capacity, and we prefiled this project with the FERC on February 1. We expect to make the official FERC filing later this year. And I'll remind you that this project will serve both the Mid-Atlantic and the Southeast markets."", 'These markets are experiencing increasing gas demand from power generation and the reshoring of industrial loads. Since the time of our open season, the large utilities that we serve in this area have come back and provided dramatic increases to their generation needs based on data centers to be built in the region, as well as reshoring of industrial markets. So we believe that we are in the early innings for expansions in these Mid-Atlantic and Southeast markets. Our project execution teams also delivered an impressive list of accomplishments this quarter. In total, we have 20 high-return projects in execution across our business, including approximately 3.1 Bcf per day of expansion on Transco, which equates to a 15% increase in fully contracted long-term capacity that will be coming online over the next few years.', ""Within these Transco opportunities, a few noteworthy accomplishments to hit. First, we placed the Carolina Market Link in service and now began receiving the full revenues in this quarter. Next, we commenced construction for the Southside Reliability Enhancement and the Southeast Energy Connector projects, and we received the FERC order for the Alabama-Georgia Connector and the Texas to Louisiana Energy Pathway projects. And finally, we're advancing a number of modest but high-return expansion projects on our MountainWest Transmission System. This is a period where we have a tremendous amount of large projects and sometimes it's easy to overlook things as large as even the well deepwater project but happy to report to you that great execution by our teams there in some pretty difficult environments has that project coming in quite a bit below our original capital estimate on that project, and we do expect now this project to start up towards the end of this year."", 'So congratulations to our deepwater team that have been working on that project for about 4 years now, and pretty remarkable accomplishments to get that project in on budget and actually below budget. And then finally, our teams are well on their way to replacing 112 mainline compressor units with state-of-the-art low-emission turbines and electric drive units on Transco and Northwest Pipe. As a reminder, these projects will generate an incremental regulated return realized through a rate case or a traction mechanism that will begin in 2025. So again, a huge body of work there to go in and replace this compression that is well past its useful life, but the team is doing a great job. You can imagine the efforts that go into replacing that scale of operations.', ""But we have so much going on. It's kind of easy to miss. So and we're excited to see the earnings from that show up in '25. So now turning to the highlights of our first quarter financial performance. We delivered quarterly EBITDA of $1.934 billion, which was 8% higher than last year, an impressive feat given the tough comp we were up against and the 25% year-over-year decline in natural gas prices and the lack of severe winter weather in most of our markets. An important takeaway from the quarter is that our outperformance occurred despite year-over-year lower earnings in the marketing and upstream segments, which reaffirms the strength and resilience of our underlying business, no matter the commodity price environment. To this end, we expect to deliver our EBITDA in the top half of our earlier guidance."", ""And to be clear, we think we can accomplish this with continued soft gas prices and without any further earnings contributions from our Marketing segment. Due to the ongoing steady growth and resilience of our business, we recently raised the 2024 dividend by 6.1% underscoring our confidence in our ability to continue this strong record of per share growth through even extreme low commodity price environments and with the slate of high-return growth projects under execution right now and in development. Williams remains well positioned to grow at this rate for many years to come. And with that, I'll turn it over to John to walk through the quarter and year-to-date financials. John?"", ""John Porter: All right. Thanks, Alan. Starting here on Slide 3 with a summary of our year-over-year financial performance. Beginning with adjusted EBITDA, we saw an 8% year-over-year increase despite natural gas prices that averaged less than $2 for the first quarter of 2024. Now included in that 8% overall growth is almost 13% growth from our primarily fee-based infrastructure businesses, excluding marketing and the upstream JV. As we'll see on the next slide, our adjusted EBITDA growth was driven by strong growth from our core large-scale Natural Gas Transmission, Gathering and Processing and Storage businesses, including the expected favorable effects of our recent acquisitions. And it also included strong performance from our Sequent Marketing business, which had another strong start to the year despite falling a bit short of the extraordinary start they had to 2023."", ""Our adjusted EPS increased 5% for the quarter, continuing to grow off of the 19% ,5-year CAGR we've had for EPS for 2018 through 2023. And available funds from operations growth was just over 4%. Also, you see our dividend coverage based on AFFO was a very strong 2.6x on a dividend that grew 6.1% over the prior year. And our debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.79x in line with our expectations for slightly higher leverage in 2024 before dropping back down in 2025 to guidance of 3.6x. So before we move to the next slide and dig a little deeper into our adjusted EBITDA growth for the quarter. We'll provide a few updates to our financial guidance. Overall, based on our strong start to 2024, we are now guiding to the upper half of our 2024 adjusted EBITDA range of $6.95 billion to $7.1 billion and we are also well positioned for upside to drive towards the high end of this original guidance."", 'We also remain well positioned to deliver on our 2025 adjusted EBITDA range of $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion. Additionally, based on our improved adjusted EBITDA outlook and other changes, including interest expense and income assumption shifts, we now see our key per share metrics, adjusted EPS and AFFO per share coming in at the high end of their ranges for 2024, which in the case of AFFO per share would lead to a higher overall dividend coverage ratio as well. Now specifically for 2024, our transmission in Gulf of Mexico business is tracking a bit ahead of plan with a good first quarter and expectations of continued best-in-class execution on our many key high-returning organic projects, as well as immediate results from our Gulf Coast storage acquisition with strong performance expected going forward.', ""Our Northeast Gathering and Processing business was basically right on plan for first quarter with drilling in the higher-margin wet gas areas and inflation adjusters offsetting lower volumes in some dry gas areas. The West got off to a strong start in the first quarter, where DJ performance following our recent transactions along with all the hard work our teams did in preparing for winter allowed for excellent execution, especially across our Rocky's assets. We see the West also tracking a bit ahead of plan, although we're also embedding a bit more conservatism around Haynesville volume assumptions. For both the Northeast and West G&P assets, our guidance update today provides room for additional volume reductions and for upside movement toward the higher end of the range if those don't occur."", ""For the Marketing business, we've had a strong overall start to 2024. But again, beating the midpoint of our full year 2024 guidance doesn't rely on any additional help from Sequent at this point. And then finally, nice to see our upstream joint ventures off to a strong start versus our plan, again, supported by the preparation our team made for winter weather. So we expect our upstream joint ventures to perform well against their plan this year as well. So let's turn to the next slide and take a little closer look at the first quarter results. Again, it was a strong start to the year with 8% growth over the prior year. Walking now from last year's $1.795 billion to this year's record $1.934 billion, we start with our Transmission in Gulf of Mexico business, which improved $111 million or 15% due to the combined effects of nearly a full quarter contribution from the Hartree Gulf Coast Storage acquisition, which is delivering as expected, following a flawless integration effort thus far."", ""Higher Transco revenues, including partial and service from the Regional Energy Access project, and also a full quarter contribution from the MountainWest Pipeline acquisition, which closed mid-February in 2023. The Segment growth was unfavorably impacted by last year's Bayou Ethane divestiture and also some planned maintenance at Discovery. Our Northeast G&P business performed well with the $34 million or 7% increase driven by a $22 million increase in service revenues. This revenue increase was fueled by rate escalations that occurred after the first quarter of last year. Overall Northeast Gathering volumes performed roughly in line with our plan, down about 2% versus the prior year, with those decreases focused in the dry gas areas. Shifting now to the West, which increased $42 million or 15%, benefiting from a great start for the DJ transactions we completed in the fourth quarter of 2023."", 'Now the increase in the DJ Basin results was about the same magnitude as the unfavorable loss of hedge gains that we had in the first quarter of 2023. Additionally, last year, the West was significantly unfavorably impacted by the severe Wyoming weather and January processing economics at our Opal, Wyoming processing plant. As I mentioned a moment ago, much work was done by our teams to prepare for winter weather this year, and those preparations proved effective in getting us off to a great start for the West and also for our upstream operations in Wyoming. Overall, West gathering volumes performed roughly in line with our plan, up 5% on the benefits of our DJ transaction and better Wyoming volumes, which more than offset declines primarily in the Haynesville area.', 'And then you see the $41 million or 18% decrease in our Gas and NGL marketing business. As I mentioned a moment ago, it was another strong start to the year, but it did come up a bit short of the extraordinary 2023 start. Our upstream joint venture operations included in our Other segment were down about $9 million or 15% from last year. Our Wamsutter upstream EBITDA was actually up about $8 million with strong volume growth that was substantially offset by lower net realized prices. However, the Wamsutter increase was more than offset by lower Haynesville results from both lower net production volumes and net realized prices. So again, a strong start to 2024 with 8% growth in EBITDA, driven by core infrastructure business performance with continued strength from our marketing business.', ""And with that, I'll turn it back to Alan."", 'Alan Armstrong: Okay. Thanks, John. And so just a few closing remarks before we turn it over to your questions. First of all, natural gas demand is not just growing now, it is accelerating. This period of low natural gas prices is reaffirming the great bargain that natural gas offers as a practical low-cost, clean energy solution and the power hungry world we live in is rapid turning to natural gas to generate this power. This compounded with the hard to miss growth in LNG exports and data centers as well as the continued drumbeat of electrify everything and resort it is accelerating demand and the expansions of our uniquely placed infrastructure will demand a premium. We have been betting on and setting our strategy around the benefits of natural gas for many years and have focused our investments in this space.', 'So if you want to invest in natural gas infrastructure, no one is more concentrated than Williams. We are the most natural gas-centric large-scale midstream company around today, and our natural gas-focused strategy will be relevant for decades to come, thanks to the accelerating natural gas demand we are seeing today. Our strong conviction of the strategy led us to the bolt-on acquisitions of strategic assets like MountainWest Pipeline, Hartree Storage and NorTex Storage. A couple of points on these acquisitions. First, these deals were quickly -- sorry, these deals were directly in line with our strategy based on where we thought the puck was going. The synergies and commercial opportunities we expected are already being realized, thanks to clear plans and decisive actions.', ""And finally, I'll reiterate our belief that Williams remains a compelling investment opportunity. Our conservative but distinct strategy continues to deliver steady, predictable growth and value to our shareholders and checks all the boxes that a long-term investor looks for in a durable and winning portfolio. We've now seen 11 consecutive years of adjusted EBITDA growth and an 8% CAGR of adjusted EBITDA since 2018 and I'll remind you that, that is without issuing equity to drive this growth. In addition, we have recognized a 19.5% return on our invested capital during the same period, and our steadfast project execution has led to record contracted transmission capacity and will continue to drive growth in 2024 and beyond. On the predictability front, we have met or beat analyst estimates for 33 quarters in a row now and beat the estimate 2/3 of the time over this 8-year period."", ""And this year marks the 50th year in a row that The Williams Companies has paid a dividend. In closing, we've built a business that is delivering record profitability and strong financial returns in the present, but is positioned even better for the future. And with that, I'll open it up for your questions."", 'See also', '10 Future Dividend Kings in the Next 5 Years or Less and', '25 Best Conservative Email Newsletters to Subscribe to.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Oswald for a review of the operating results. Steve?"", 'Stephen Oswald', ""Okay, Nathan, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today for our first quarter conference call today. And as usual I'll give an update on the current situation of the Company and towards Sumant will review our R&D, our financials in detail. I will start off with an update on our continued progress towards vision 2027. For background, this vision and strategy was developed coming out of the COVID pandemic over the summer and fall of 2022, unanimously approved by the common Board in November 2022 and then presented to investors the following month in New York. We had excellent feedback since that time to content management has been executing the vision 2027 strategy by consolidating its facility footprint, continuing its targeted acquisition program, increasing the revenue proportion of engineered product and aftermarket content executing our offloading strategy with defense primes and high-growth segments of the defense budget and by expanding content on key commercial aerospace platforms. We all have conviction in the vision 2027 goals and strategy and believe the near term and midterm catalysts, along with strong results ahead for DCO. present a unique long-term value creation opportunity for shareholders. The Q1 2024 results were very good example of the strategy at work. Q1 was an outstanding quarter and a great start to the year. For the comp revenues exceeded $190 million for the third consecutive quarter at $190.8 million, growing 5.3% over the prior year. Strong growth in our commercial aircraft businesses across both Boeing and Airbus slowed. Our rotorcraft business helped drive revenue during the quarter. Recovery on the 7A7 was notable with revenues more than doubling over the prior year period, as well as strong growth on A220 platform, we make the skins for the entire fuselage. Overall, commercial aerospace with Airbus and Boeing and others was up 11% from Q1 2023 despite volumes experienced continued challenges with Max quality issues. We have now grown our year-over-year revenue in our commercial aerospace business for 11 consecutive quarters, demonstrating the resilience of our business, even in even in a challenging OEM environment. Our defense business grew 1% year over year as strong demand for the Black Hawk, Apache and F-35 platforms, as well as selected naval programs, including the Salix close-in weapon system and other weapons systems for submarines. Growth was partially offset by declines in legacy programs such as the F-18, which we have talked about in the past and a pause in the total missile production for which we expect a new contract anticipate starting shipments again in 2025. Defense business was almost $100 million in revenue in the first quarter. We remain optimistic about the growth ahead as we go through a timing transition of certain programs. The ever-growing backlog in defense tells the story of $125 million from last year and $42 million from Q4 2023. Defense backlog now stands at over $0.5 billion at $569 million. This good wins with RTX in Q1 were important driver for the increased defense backlog. The SPY six program is part of the US Navy's family of radars that performs air and missile defense on seven classes of ships as a giant leap for the fleet and SPY six radars are integrated, meaning they can defend against ballistic missiles, cruise missiles hypersonic missiles, Fossil aircraft and surface ships simultaneously. Carmen, as has been provided one card for the program as this is part of the offloading strategy we've been working on, and I'm very happy to report that we've been awarded a second car from RTX for the STY6 in Q1 after 18 months of work. These are a slow transition as I've mentioned in the past and it should be, but now it pays off. And the order for two cars in Q1, one new and one follow-on was over $50 million this is also great news as we are now building out a much bigger business in RADAR support, complementing our long-term track record in missile support, new car award deliveries are expected to begin in 2025 and the current card shipments are ongoing. As communicated on the overall offloading program, we anticipate that the long-term run rate of the STY. six and other defense programs already commercialized or in development will now be $135 million in 2025, an increase of $10 million over our prior target of $125 million for 2025. It has been a long journey, but well worth it. Another real highlight in Q1 was gross margin of 24.6% for the quarter, up 430 basis points year-over-year from 20.3% as we continue to realize benefits from our strategic value pricing initiatives, productivity improvements, growing the engineered product portfolio and initial restructuring savings. We also made significant reductions in the scope of our operations at our variable Arkansas facility during Q1 with several programs fully transitioned into comments, Joplin, Missouri facility, roughly 200 miles away. This has allowed us to start realizing a portion of the savings expected for variable closure during the first quarter with one more program left to transition with RTX. We also continue to make a full effort with Boeing, commercial and Boeing Defense on the MAX wireless and Apache tail, respectively. Working with them on approvals and building buffer. We're in the final transition phase with some headwinds in Q2 and Q3 of this year. But long term, we are driving to a great outcome for the common Boeing and our shareholders for adjusted operating income margins. In Q1, the team delivered 9% compared to 7.5% in Q1 2023 great results, driven by the continued growth in our Engineered Product businesses and with our restructuring savings beginning to kick in during the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was another great story in Q1 of 14.4% of revenue compared to 12.7% in Q1 2023. 170 basis points improvement year over year gives to calm and a great start to 2024 as you work towards the 18% for the Vision 2027 goals. The GAAP diluted EPS was $0.46 a share in Q1 2024 versus $0.42 a share for Q1 2023. And with the adjustments, diluted EPS was a solid $0.7 a share compared to a diluted EPS of $0.63 a share in the prior year quarter. Higher GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS was driven by improved operating income as well as lower interest costs during the quarter. The Company's consolidated backlog increased sequentially and compared to the prior year quarter. Total Company backlog ended Q1 at a record of $1.46 billion, decreasing over $52 million sequentially and was $85 million year over year. Defense backlog, as mentioned earlier, also increased $125 million compared to the prior year quarter to end at a record $569 million. Strong defense backlog reaffirms that the common defense business remains well positioned with more positive news to come. Commercial aerospace backlog decreased slightly year over year, primarily due to industry issues in the single-aisle production rates and the MAX issues mentioned earlier with Boeing and Spirit. However, our commercial aerospace backlog still grow relative to Q4 2023 at $442 million in Q1. Our team delivered another good quarter, managing the supply chain as evidenced by another quarter of positive revenue growth and significant gross margin expansion compared to the prior your period, our revenue guidance for the remainder of 2024. We continue to believe that the uncertainty surrounding BA Spirit and the FAA at this point on the MAX, the best approach, the best approach to again guide to middle mid single digit. And looking further updates on the next earnings call, we do see a slowdown in the MAX bill rates not for their own reasons in Q2 and Q3 for this year where commercial aerospace will be a bit lighter due to the situation by softness in the MAX, which is a major program for us. We are comforted by continued strength on other programs such as the 7A7 and Airbus programs included in the eight to 20. The best part is the max bill rate will actually be at a much higher level. And we continue to work on gaining more share, strong bookings and growing backlog in defense business is also supportive of our revenue outlook. Now let me provide some additional color on our markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector. We experienced revenue just below $100 billion at $98.9 million compared to $97.7 million in Q1 2023. While growth was muted, we saw positive signs in our military helicopter products, including strong demand, the Blackhawk program with revenues growing over 70% and also for Apache tail rotor blades, which grew more than 50% year over year. Our naval business also performed well. We saw strong growth in the Phalanx close-in weapon system used on surface ships as well as other weapons systems for submarines. First quarter's military and space revenue represented 52% of the Company's revenue in the period, down from 59% back in 2022 and 70% in 2021. We expect that this trend will continue reflecting more balance with commercial aerospace, which we like. We also ended the first quarter with a backlog of $569 million, an increase of $125 million year over year, representing 54% of the comments total backlog. Our commercial aerospace operations, first quarter revenue continued to see double digit growth, increasing 11% year over year to $80 million, driven mainly by bill rate increases on large aircraft platforms, including the seven 37 MAX seven eight seven and eight to 20 platforms, along with growth growth on commercial rotary wing aircraft platforms and regional and business jets. As many of you are aware, the FAA announced in January that will increase its oversight of Boeing prior volume to get FAA approval for production rate increases for the seven 37 MAX. This will likely cap production on the seven 37. We do, however, expect the long-term China remained very positive once the issues are fully addressed, this rate limitations did not have a significant impact on our first quarter results. The backlog within our commercial aerospace business was $442 million at the end of the first quarter, increasing with $12 million sequentially, a solid number given the temporary weakness in the commercial aerospace markets. With that, I'll have Suman review our financial results in detail."", 'Suman Mookerji', ""Thank you, Steve. As a reminder, please see the Company's Q1 10-Q and Q1 earnings release for a further description of information mentioned on today's call. As Steve discussed, our first quarter results reflected another period of strong performance. Despite industry headwinds. We again saw a significant increase in our commercial aerospace revenues. We remain encouraged by the continued strength in domestic and global travel, which should support higher long-term demand for aircraft as we work through some of the industry issues impacting single-aisle production rates. In addition, we are encouraged by the record backlog we achieved in the first quarter, especially in our military and space end-user segment with all this, we feel like we are beginning 2024 with good momentum that will continue to drive our performance. Now turning to our first quarter results. Revenue for the first quarter of 2024 was $190.8 million versus $181.2 million for the first quarter of 2023. The year-over-year increase of 5.3% reflects growth in all three of our end user segments, highlighted by $8.1 million of growth across our commercial aerospace platforms and $1.3 million of growth in our military and space platform. We posted total gross profit of $46.9 million or 24.6% of revenue for the quarter versus $36.8 million or 20.3% of revenue in the prior year period. We continue to provide adjusted gross margins as we have certain non-GAAP cost of sales items in the current and prior period relating to inventory step-up, amortization on our recent acquisitions, restructuring charges and the impact from the Guaymas fire on our operations. On an adjusted basis, our gross margins were 25% in Q1 2024 versus 21.1% in Q1 2023. The improvement in gross margin was driven by our growing Engineered Products portfolio, strategic pricing initiatives, productivity improvements and some initial restructuring savings. We continue to make progress working through a difficult operating environment with supply chain and labor. Through our proactive efforts, including strategic buys and our inventory investments, we have been able to avoid any significant impacts thus far on our business during the first quarter of 2024, we increased our inventory by $9.8 million from year end 2023 to position our performance centers to meet our 2024 delivery commitments we also grew our contract assets net of contract liabilities by $15 million. We continue to look for opportunities to unwind our working capital investments to improve our cash flow. Ecommerce reported operating income for the first quarter of $12.6 million or 6.6% of revenue, compared to $6.4 million or 3.5% of revenue in the prior year period. Adjusted operating income was $17.1 million or 9% of revenue this quarter compared to $13.6 million or 7.5% of revenue in the comparable period last year. Company reported net income for the first quarter of 2024 of $6.8 million or $0.46 per diluted share compared to net income of $5.2 million or $0.42 per diluted share a year ago. On an adjusted basis, the Company reported net income of $10.4 million or $0.7 per diluted share compared to net income of $7.9 million or $0.63 in Q1 2023. The higher net income and adjusted net income during the quarter were driven by the higher operating income and adjusted operating income. Additionally, our interest rate hedge helped to reduce our year-over-year interest expense. Now let me turn to our segment results. Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $83.3 million in the first quarter of 2024 versus $75.6 million last year. The year-over-year increase reflected $5.7 million of higher sales across our commercial aerospace applications, including the seven eight seven three seven MAX and the A. two 20, in addition to selected commercial rotorcraft platforms and $2.1 million of higher revenue within the military and space markets, driven by strength in the Black Hawk and Apache programs. Structural Systems operating income for the quarter was $2.9 million or 3.4% of revenue compared to $4.7 million or 6.3% of revenue for the prior year quarter. Excluding restructuring charges and other adjustments in both years, the segment operating margin was 7.8% in Q1 2024 versus 12.9% in Q1 2023. This can be attributed to higher costs in our Monrovia plant as it winds down production, reducing operating margins year over year our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $107.5 million in the first quarter of 2024 versus $105.6 million in the prior year period. The increase was mainly due to growth across the commercial aerospace platforms and certain military platforms, including the F-35 and naval programs such as the failings close-in weapon system and submarine launch missile launch systems, partially offset by the impact and timing of reduction in legacy platforms such as the F-18 electronic systems. Operating income for the first quarter was $19 million or 17.6% of revenue versus $10 million or 9.4% of revenue in the prior year period. Excluding restructuring charges and other adjustments in both years. The segment operating margin was 18.4% in Q1 2024 versus 11.6% in Q1 2023. The year-over-year increase was due to favorable product mix, including growth in our Engineered Products portfolio, strategic pricing initiatives, as well as savings from restructuring program. Beginning to kick in during the quarter, restructuring savings were driven by the transition of product lines from our variable Performance Center two other facilities. Next to provide an update on restructuring. As a reminder, and as previously discussed, we commenced a restructuring initiative back in 2022. These actions are being taken to accelerate the achievement of our strategic goals and to better position the Company for stronger performance in the short and long term. This includes the shutdown of our facilities in Monrovia, California and variable Arkansas and the transfer of that work to our low-cost operation in Guaymas, Mexico and to other existing performance centers in the United States. We continue to make progress on these transitions with excellent employee retention and engagement and are also working diligently with our customers, Boeing and RTX to obtain the requisite approvals. During Q1 2024, we recorded $1.4 million in restructuring charges. The majority of these charges were severance and related benefits as we continue to wind down the two operations. The recertification process is ongoing, so we plan to complete production at both facilities by the end of the second quarter. We expect to incur an additional $5 million to $6 million in restructuring expenses through the end of 2024. As we complete the program upon the completion of our restructuring program, we expect to generate $11 million to $13 million in annual savings from our actions and are beginning to see realization of these actions in this year. We anticipate selling the land and building at both Monrovia California and variable Arkansas. Turning next to liquidity and capital resources. During Q1 2024, we used $1.6 million in cash flow from operating activities, which was an improvement compared to Q1 2023 usage of $18.9 million. The improvement was due to a smaller increase in inventories and higher contract liabilities, partially offset by higher contract assets as of the end of the first quarter, we had available liquidity of $208.1 million, comprising of the unutilized portion of our revolver and cash on hand. Our existing credit facility was put in place in July 2023 at an opportune time in the credit markets, allowing us to reduce our spread, increased the size of our revolver and allowing us the flexibility to execute on our acquisition strategy. Interest expense was $3.9 million compared to $4.2 million in Q1 of 2023 the year-over-year improvement of interest cost despite a higher debt balance was due to the interest rate hedge going into effect in November 2021, we put in place an interest rate hedge that went into effect for a seven year period starting January 2024 and back to the one month term, so far at 170 basis points or $150 million of our debt. That has resulted in interest savings of $1.3 million in Q1 2024. We will continue to drive significant interest cost savings in 2024 and beyond. To conclude the financial overview for Q1 2024, I would like to say that we had a strong start to 2024 and anticipate a strong balance of the year. I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks."", 'Stephen Oswald', ""Thanks, Suman. Next month In closing, Q1 was an excellent quarter a record in some cases with many highlights for the Company and our shareholders. The strong start to the year with solid revenue and earnings growth certainly strengthens our path to delivering on the goals we set out in the Vision 2027. 2024 is also our 175th year of continuous operation, a great achievement and will be recognizing that through the year. I did the math recently the door the Company has been continuously open for over 43,000 business days a long time at a young country like the United States, what a great story with a very bright future ahead for the Company, our shareholders and all other stakeholders. Thank you for listening. And let's now open up for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Mike Crawford, B. Riley Securities.', 'Michael Crawford', ""Thank you, Steve. What are some of the main pressure points you're or you're trying to avoid what the strategic inventory buys like? Would it be titanium, which the come becoming a problem for summer? What else do you?"", 'Stephen Oswald', ""Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Good morning. Yes, you know, look at titanium is obviously a big one. I mean, as the wide body three 50 and these other platforms start going up. And obviously the situation in Russia is something that we've been very proactive over the last couple of years and are in really good shape with our Tiete. And the other thing we did on strategic buyer was really around the card business. Oh, I know there's less drama now than there was in the past, but we did go out buy ahead on certain things for certain cards. Obviously, it's an important business for us just getting more important. So I'd say those two, I think we're in good shape or we're not going to plan on doing a lot of things. You know, I mean, titanium aside on things like for the for the circuit cards, we'll probably just continue to take it day by day, but those are the two reports I have."", 'Michael Crawford', ""Okay. Excellent. And then firm, I mean, you did call out the F-18 as a legacy platform is in decline when that might eventually about where it could be the blackout, although that's going up and you know what, whether the maybe some of the other key platforms that are that are growing for you and conversely, some maybe phasing out a little bit just given the?"", 'Stephen Oswald', ""Sure sure. I'd say, look, you know, you're spot on the F-18 is the one, right? So we all know about the F-18. We know what's happening in St. Louis we are going to see, I think still good business in depot maintenance and other things. So we know that that's still going to be an okay program for us. That's kind of the biggest one I talked about the total missile. Again, these things are timing related. So we're going to see the total come back and we're going to start shipping again we plan in 2025. I mean, we as far as other on the positive side, I mean, we couldn't be happier with the Blackhawk business. I mean, it's even though I know there's lots of discussion and everything that business is going great for us. The Apache I also mentioned that we're just starting to move higher and higher and the Seahawk as Sikorsky as well. So our rotary business was terrific. Despite the F-18, we still agile, great the volume and the F-35 and some other programs. And so we're feeling very good, especially with the backlog, Mike, and just get the second car."", 'Suman Mookerji', 'With some of the other missile programs, if I may add in are also giving us strength, including the mirror missile the standard missile. And as Steve previously pointed out, the SPY six radar and next-generation jammer. So missile and radar from programs are helping offset the decline in the legacy programs and the transition time.', 'Michael Crawford', ""Right. Okay, thank you. Just one final one for me. Kind of related to ARM to the rotary platform. So and last, it's now just over a year since you acquired BLR aerospace and I know one of the goals there was maybe trying to get some of their unique structures into military aircraft. Is there some progress there?"", 'Stephen Oswald', ""Or working on it right now and like you're spot on that, you know, our big opportunity is really with the Black Hawk, and that's really for the National Guard. So we have a lot of things. I think that these things obviously take time, right, but we're excited. We think that also with some of the other news about switching out the engine on that, I think will be more opportunity for that. So that's stay tuned on that, probably next one. Thank you."", 'Michael Crawford', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Michael Ciarmoli, Truist Securities.', 'Michael Ciarmoli', ""Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question and nice results and maybe a kind of a two-part I guess, Steve or Sumant, just because the margins are really strong in the ES segment, you commented on pricing and I know you threw out the value based and I think that's something we hear pretty often now. Any anything you guys are doing differently with pricing outside of just taking advantage of the whole inflationary environment? And then kind of just how do we think about these the some electronic systems margins going forward? I think I think that was a record level of eight to kind of say, okay, let's let's extrapolate this you know, it sounded like you got some some mix in there as well, but any color on both those items?"", 'Suman Mookerji', ""Yes, Mike, great question. We are really happy with the Electronic Systems margins this quarter, as you noted, pricing is a key factor. And certainly, as you have seen across the aftermarket in the industry, pricing has been strong and we have seen the same kind of beyond that. There are a couple of other things at play here, kind of two themes that are key drivers of our Vision 2027 strategy and one is growing the Engineered Products portfolio and as that continues to grow as a percentage of revenue in the engineered electronic systems business in the drop-through is really good. So we've had good growth in kind of engineered product businesses. And the second is the consolidation of footprint strategy, right? And that has also started kicking in this quarter with a program getting fully transitioned from our variable performance center to our Triathlon Performance Center. And after taking out a significant amount of cost early in the quarter out of the variable facility, which is now has a skeleton crew and only one active program. Those other programs are now being produced out of Joplin without much addition to overhead and SG&A in that business. So that's really driving the margins, those two factors and outside of some minor impacts of product mix, I think the general trend is sustainable. And I mean the current margins we're seeing within a narrow band is sustainable going forward."", 'Michael Ciarmoli', 'Is there any way to quantify what you what you saw from the run rate consolidation savings? I know you said $11 million to $13 million you know annualized. So it sounds like you got got some Any way to quantify that still in the early stages of that?', 'Suman Mookerji', ""It's over $1 million during the current quarter. Protalix Yes."", 'Stephen Oswald', ""I think I mean, I think this is a good story. I mean, look, we're thrilled with the number and you're spot on about the 18%. So we're excited about that. We think that again, as we move into the 2nd year of Vision 2027, you know that these things are coming together and we're obviously driving value pricing across the board. Right. So that's going to Got it."", 'Michael Ciarmoli', ""And then I guess conversely, on structural systems, sounds like you're just dealing with are overhead under absorption issues as yet transition it sounds like I mean, should we expect that that margin rate to persist next two quarters? And you know, I guess it doesn't sound like anything really out of the normal except for just the kind of wind-down drag?"", 'Suman Mookerji', ""Yes. I mean, our Monrovia Performance Center, which is being wound down revenues, it were almost a third of what they were on a year-over-year quarter basis, almost half on a sequential quarter basis. So that's naturally going to create a significant amount of drag on margins. And as you can imagine, in a facility being wound down. It's not it's not that easy, right? So we do expect the that to linger for the next one to two quarters, but gradually improve that trend is going to be improvement, it's not. And then really the benefits of the complete closure will only kick in in 2025 when we not only shut down the facility in Monrovia here in 2024, but then start actively producing some of those products out of Guaymas in 2025."", 'Stephen Oswald', ""Now might you guys have heard me on the call, so you know, my role is very close to Los Angeles. It's in that area and you know, and so it's the size of an aircraft carrier. Okay. So yes, from that, you have a small plant, right? So it's been around for a long time, too. So good things ahead. There are very we're at the the three yard line here. So in that regard at all."", 'Michael Ciarmoli', ""Got it. And last one for me, Stephen, I don't want to put words in your mouth there numbers here, but I think you started that defense offloading. I don't know if that was really in earnest in late '20 or '21. But if you're thinking in the $135 million by '25, I mean I could go back and take your 20 defense revenue run rate and I could get something, you know, north of $550 million by '25. Obviously you're losing some work in there. You know, F-18, I'm sure there are some other programs, but, you know, how should we think about this defense growth trajectory? You know, again, it might not be apples to apples the way I'm thinking about it, but I can come up with some some pretty sharp growth there."", 'Stephen Oswald', ""Yes, you're right. It's not it's a lead, some you know like human. I'm looking at the numbers here as we speak or you know, like a company like GA, right? So we've had a lot of a couple of really good years with GA. But we know that that whole market has been disrupted for them because of these lower costs, UAVs and everything, right. So our volume was down under the FA Hematide, but some other stuff. But a lot of what we're seeing, we're seeing a lot of repeat orders, but we're getting like the Next Generation Jammer, ditto that's coming out of RTX and Virginia and Appleton. So we consider that, you know, offload, right? Yes, I mean so even though you might say, well, you know, we they had if they were to us. We love what you guys are doing to take it same thing with the SPY six. So I think that it's not apples to apples, but I think overall, the story I think holds pretty well and that's what we want we want to. We've got a as you know, there's a lot of new programs out there. These things delay and you do all that, but we want the stuff that's got a long, long life like SPY six, right? It's going to be in the fleet forever, and we want that current business that's already and I made as well as the new stuff from us, right, that as well. So I think it is more to come down that. Okay. As well, we get the '26 2027, but let's hold it now $135 million."", 'Michael Ciarmoli', ""Got it. All right. Good stuff. I'll jump back in the queue, guys. Thanks, Mike."", 'Operator', 'Ken Herbert, RBC Capital Markets.', 'Ken Herbert', ""Yes, good morning, Steve. Steve, when we look at the gross margins in the first quarter, is there any reason that they don't that they would step down in the second quarter or is this gross margin run rate now something we should model moving forward?"", 'Suman Mookerji', ""I'll take a first stab at that. And so we are really happy with the gross margins in the first quarter, as I said on the electronics side, driven by engineered products, the restructuring savings, and that really were the key drivers. If you look at the overall company, they were partially offset by the headwinds we had in Monrovia and the structures business are these outside of, I would say, marginal benefits from product mix during the quarter. These gross margins and within a fairly narrow band are sustainable. And I mean, if you when I look at our adjusted gross margin in Q4, it was 23.2% last year. So and it's now 25%. So it's yes, if you look at so quarter year over year in all is a big difference and especially with some of the adjustments. But we been able to take more of the adjustments into the GAAP gross margin, which is a really good thing. And now I would say we feel really good about these margins going forward within the narrow range."", 'Ken Herbert', ""Great, thank you. And can you level set us on you're expected, I guess either max deliveries this year or sort of a monthly or quarterly production rate because it sounds like there's maybe a step down sequentially from the first to the second to the third quarter, but maybe an anticipated tick in the back of the year can you maybe sort of comment on where you are on that program and how we should think about the cadence for the year on the MAX?"", 'Stephen Oswald', ""Yes. So I can't yes, good question. So look, we are we are not we had a fairly good first quarter because there's a lot of things still happening right until this. So this terrible thing happened obviously in January and lots of things came out of that. So from June was pretty good. April was a bit light. So you know, we're going to anticipate a little bit lighter action on it, though, because remember, we're both feeding Spirit, which is a major customer as well as a Boeing OEM, right? So BCA. So we know right now, we're thinking you know, maybe it's in the mid 20s, you know, lower to mid 20s for the second quarter. We'll have to figure out the third when we get there right, based on their progress, but we see it coming back. The nice thing is to for our shareholders and for all of us, if you were working real hard with and I don't want I can't go make any announcement right now. We're working on gaining share on the MAX. Okay. As well, the A. two, 23, 20. So we're working on those types of things. And so yes, I think, Ken, we're going to get a little shallower, maybe mid 20s. You know, certainly it's been a little lighter in April, but nothing where we're concerned, we want to be transparent, but we have 77, which I know has its own problems, but we're seeing a nice bounce back there and we're happy with our Airbus business, so as well as GM."", 'Ken Herbert', 'Great. And thanks. And just finally, Steve, where would you see the opportunity on the A. three, 20 or even the A. two 20 take share and what could be the timing around some of the share gains with Airbus on a narrow-body portfolio?', 'Stephen Oswald', ""Again, we're looking at probably within 12 months. So working on something right now, we'll see how it goes, right, because these things are, you know, these things take time, but we think within 12 months, we might have something going again on the three, 20 and eight to 20. We could just continue to or continue to grow. As you know, that's a major program for us and good things ahead there."", 'Ken Herbert', 'Great. Thanks Steve. Thanks, Suman.', 'Suman Mookerji', 'That again, thank you.', 'Operator', 'Jason Gursky, Citi.', 'Jason Gursky', ""So apologies. I had myself on mute. Some Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking the questions for LG Uplus. And what does, Steve, I wanted to ask about a little bit more about Vision 2027 and in particular the M&A component of the vision there because you've got some inorganic growth, I think you'd like to get done. So the question I guess, is maybe a bit of a two-part question, Tom. We've got a company that recently went public that's now got you have access to some more money that claims that it's going to go out and be heavily involved in buying up proprietary product type companies. So I'm just kind of curious what the competitive environment looks like these days for assets. So I guess, A., the pipelines pipe what's the pipeline looking like? What's the competitive environment look like? And then I also want to just kind of get your take on the size and scale of things that you guys would be willing to offer and maybe talk a little bit about that dynamic that's going on there with one of your big customers and spirit in the Airbus work is that it seems like it's a Boeing by spirit that Airbus work has got to go somewhere. And just kind of curious what kind of appetite you guys might all have for taking on some of that work of all in the context of your of your M&A strategy?"", 'Stephen Oswald', ""Yes. No, thanks, Jason. Good to be with you on the first just on our Vision 2027 and the acquisition piece, we have a placeholder for $75 million, right? So we're a bit modest on that because obviously, it's only 2024 we got several years ahead of us. So we feel good about that. And again, it's a bit modest, but we're right now as we go forward in time, we've really been happy with what we're doing acquisitions. I think it's been a real great thing for shareholders and for the company. And so but we're looking more where we can do some you know, maybe look at acquisitions where they can, you know, again how our current engineered product portfolio. We're committed to that to build business on that side. I think that's smart and it's a winning formula for our shareholders. I think you know, 75 again is low. I think we're going to do more bolt-ons. But again, if we can find something where there can be some consolidation. We're going to do that as well. So I think for the next couple of years, that's sort of where we where we sit as far as Spirit, as you know, just you know, for Airbus, we ship directly to Toulouse for FRH. 20. So we're really just working with them directly. We don't really do anything for Airbus for Spirit spirits, much more, I think in the A3 50 world, which we're not right now. So we'd be open to it. I mean, you know, I think it's as I read the notes this morning on some of the situations in the meeting in New York last night, it's going to be difficult, but we're there. I mean, we have the capacity, you know, that could be an upside for us. You know, have nothing to report on it, but we certainly I don't think we could we could help out and Airbus again, for all the business we do right now is a first tier. We do everything with Toulouse direct."", 'Jason Gursky', ""Okay, great. So the $75 million placeholder looks like that through the 27 time frame you think is going to be a pretty achievable. I'm just kind of curious, though, what does the pipeline look like today? What do you think the cadence of or potential timing of some of those acquisitions might be? Is it's going to be a near term, more back-end weighted towards 2027 and just kind of what the competitive environment looks like and pricing on the kinds of assets that you might be chasing?"", 'Stephen Oswald', ""A few things. Okay. So we're always in the market. So I'll just say that, right. So you know, our companies were looking at things. We have an excellent team here, led by Sumant on M&A. You know, if something comes up this year. We're going to do it our cases. So that's obviously slowed down from COVID for everybody. But you know, we'd like to do at least one, if not two a year again this year, you know, and just the DLR back in last May, so or last April and May. So we'd have, you know, a little bit of time now. So what we're always in the market, it is, you know, it's competitive. I mean, you've I know you follow the companies and many of them and, you know, it's a crowded lobby. But I will tell you that for what we want and what we've done, I mean, we've got a we've got a really good hit rate. We've had a lot of success for the things we've gone after, not every single one, but you know, it's up there. So we're excited about building that part of the business. That's a big thing for me when I came into 2020 in 2017. And so I like to remind you, was there anything else either?"", 'Suman Mookerji', ""Yes, we've been actively looking at businesses I would say there's been a pickup in deal flow in late Q1 and coming into Q2, we're seeing more assets come to market or the competitive environment. I wouldn't say necessarily has dramatically changed the Company you referenced that went public recently has been around and looking for similar assets for over 10 years, but we've certainly come across them in the past so I don't see that dynamic changing now. So we will continue to be aggressive for businesses that we really like and where we really think we can drive a lot of incremental value for our shareholders, and we will continue to be aggressive with those opportunities. And as we have demonstrated in the past five years and we can, despite the competitive environment with assets at a price at which we can still drive additional benefit and ROI for our shareholders. So we feel good about being able to continue doing that and timing as Steve said, is difficult to predict as that's active work ongoing on several opportunities that timing always difficult to predict on M&A on now."", 'Stephen Oswald', ""And Jason, just to chime in or you know, we're also are very excited about organic growth, okay? We really want to get hopefully the Max and find its way by the end of the year. I mean, if they're at 50 at some point in the future, you would drop through and everything else right now, we feel very good about our current operation to deliver."", 'Jason Gursky', ""Okay, great. That's a wonderful appreciate the time, Sanjay."", 'Stephen Oswald', 'So I appreciate common.', 'Operator', ""Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to Steve Oswald for closing remarks."", 'Stephen Oswald', ""Okay. Thank you very much and thanks for joining us today. Obviously, we're we couldn't be happier with our Q1. I want to thank I thank my team of people working hard every day to come and with our relentless approach to saying. So that's what we do here. And we are very encouraged as we come out of March to have a I think a super year for everybody for our shareholders and for our company and the for all of the stakeholders involved with us. So again, thanks for joining us. Have a great and safe day. Thank you."", 'Operator', ""Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program.

And with that, I'll turn it to Maury."", ""Maury Gallagher : Thank you, Sherry, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. As you can see from our release, our results are not where we want them to be. Historically, our Q1 is one of our strongest quarters. Last year's 15% operating income showed this strength. If you look at our operations, operationally, we ran the same airline this Q1 that we ran in 2023. Departures ASMs, passengers all were are within 2% of each other. In fact, we've had minimal growth since 2021, averaging approximately 3% per year during these past three years. Given with this minimal growth, however, we have been one of the most profitable airlines during these turbulent times. But in the last year, we and the industry have experienced major expense increases, particularly salaries and specifically with our pilots."", ""Additionally, we had problems predicting how many pilots would be available for us last year. This time last year, we were losing more than a pilot a day, annualizing out to a 40% annual attrition rate. Stuff is hemorrhaging in June, we began to accrue future bonus payable to our crew members after we sign an agreement. Through this April, we have accrued and expensed $80 million without any corresponding offset of a new pilot agreement. We hope to have this new agreement in the not too distant future. You'll hear today from Greg, Drew, Robert, Scott and Micah Richins about our current status, including comments on our revenue problems tied to our Navitaire upgrade, Boeing deliveries and the lack of productivity of our fleet and pilots, particularly due during our off peak periods."", ""There are a number of reasons for this drop off in productivity. Clearly, the pandemic changed our rhythms, our routines, our annual cycle of hiring and training new pilots for the coming year in the fall, adding them in January, February for March, uptick and the late spring for the summer sprint. We've been out of this rhythm for the past three years. We are about to resume this proven approach in the back half of this year and into 2025. A critical component of this rhythm is obviously having airplanes. Our Boeing order of 50 MAX plus 80 options provides us with the necessary aircraft for the anticipated growth in the coming years. Let me emphasize that the model remains the same. Going forward, we need to reinstate execution of the model that has worked so well."", 'Additionally, we are optimizing our revenue software, finalizing MAX deliveries, as I mentioned, and working with our pilots to finish an agreement. Let me turn to Sunseeker at this point. We are excited to finally have this world class destination resort open and operating. Initial reviews are all exceptional on the reviews are all exceptional on the quality of the personnel, the product and in particular, to the quality of the cuisine. Like all new projects, however, there is a run-in time. Opening at the end of December was not ideal. The date was driven by the construction delays we experienced for most of last year. Given we made the decision to open in late October, we did not have as much time as we would have liked to market and sell this new destination resort.', ""We're using many tools drive traffic, not the least of which is our 18 million person customer database. We've had success with this program sending out as many as 25 million to 30 million emails per week on Sunseeker specifically. We are learning the booking patterns for Southwest Florida what the differences are. We saw some expected strength in Q1. Q2 and Q3, however, will be slower, and we're trying to understand where they will settle. Given the patterns we are experiencing at this point, we are lowering our estimates to a negative $15 million EBITDA for this year. Micah Richins, President of Sunseeker, will have more comments in just a moment. While Sunseeker will be a project for '24 and '25, the airline problems we are currently experiencing can be addressed for the most part during the remainder of this year and into 2025."", ""By then, we should be hitting our stride. A comment about the industry. For years, we have been grouped together with other low cost, low fare companies, particularly Spirit and Frontier. While all of us offer low fares and have focused on leisure customers, we would be remiss if we did not point out that our model has made money consistently during this pandemic time. In particular, I want to direct your attention to the revenue differences. In the just completed Q1, our unit revenue, or TRASM, was $0.132 compared to $0.092 average or 42% greater than the aforementioned operators. In today's inflationary world, the ability to generate sufficient revenues and increase revenues is the difference between success and failure. Cost management is also important, no doubt."", ""Given our increased utilization later this year and into 2025, you'll see our unit cost decline accordingly. An important component of our revenues has been our third-party revenues. And while they are not that big on an absolute basis, they are very powerful for the bottom line. This quarter of our $8.21 per passenger was worth $33 million of operating income. That's a 30% increase over last year's $6.32. In spite of our problems with our revenue tools in Navitaire, we still had one of our best unit revenues in the company history. Many things go into this ability to generate stronger revenues, including brand and reputation, and we are pleased with how we have positioned ourselves. If you look at the success of the majors, one only has to point to their loyalty programs to see the power of third-party revenues."", 'We understand this benefit and are focused on this producing more of these very accretive dollars. Life is about rhythm. We all work better, have better results when we when, what we do is known, is repeatable and predictable. Looking back on our successes over the past 20 years, while the model is a critical component, namely 77% of our routes do not have direct competition, the execution component, the rhythm each year is also critical. The past many years post COVID, the rhythm, the routine has not been present. To the contrary, there has been minimal predictability, uncertain rhythm, starts and stops. The fog is lifting in the traditional focus, and we are in better control of our own actions going forward. The model is just fine, as I mentioned, as strong as ever.', 'The rhythm is coming back. Stay tuned for the good news. Greg?', ""Greg Anderson: Maury, thank you. Team Allegiant delivered another strong operational performance this quarter with a 99.7% controllable completion rate. That puts us near the top of the industry, and that's thanks to the tremendous efforts of our front line team members. We have a long history of providing a great service at an attractive price for our customers. And our differentiated model is focused on being the only nonstop carrier on the vast majority of our on the vast majority of our 525 routes. That is a structural advantage that affords us great relationships within our origination and destination market, which, in addition, contribute to our strong ancillary and third-party revenue. Our differentiation is why we have been able to generate industry leading margins and profitability for our investors over the long-term."", ""While I am pleased with our operational and customer service metrics this quarter, our first quarter adjusted operating margin of 6.2% is disappointing and is not reflective of Allegiant's earnings potential. These results were impacted by three distinct issues: lower aircraft utilization during peak periods, Navitaire implementation timing and Boeing's delivery delays. Starting with lower utilization. March 2024 flying was about 20% less than where we would have liked it to be. The primary constraint of our peak utilization has been the uncertainty of our pilot staffing levels. We were impacted by the same industry wide shortage faced by our peers, and our attrition levels were meaningfully elevated coming out of COVID but beginning to normalize around the middle of 2023."", 'It was because at this time, we implemented a retention bonus for our pilots that materially helped stem attrition. It is important to us that our pilots receive fair and competitive compensation. In advance of an agreed upon pilot contract, we are accruing upwards of $6 million per month for this bonus. Given our pilot staffing levels have turned to being stable, we are just starting to realize some of these benefits through our scheduling as we work towards restoring our peak utilization. On a related note, achieving a pilot labor contract continues to be a priority of ours, and I am optimistic that we can come to an agreement in the not too distant future. We value our relationships with our pilots and are encouraged by the forward movement made since the recent changes in union leadership.', ""Since cutting over to Navitaire in the second half of '23, we have made a lot of progress in the system that runs all of our reservations and revenue management. It offers critical new features over our legacy homegrown system. This includes the ability for international expansion and further efficiencies that are expected to improve our dynamic pricing and increase ancillary revenues. That migration last year went well for the most critical aspects as customers had a seamless ability to book and to fly. However, migrating our ancillary data has taken longer than we expected, which caused a reduction of about $2 per passenger in ancillary fees in the quarter. As you all know, that is high margin revenue for us. Turning to Boeing. Due to their well-publicized issues, we are experiencing even further delivery delays since our last earnings call."", ""As a reminder, we had originally anticipated and planned for sox MAX deliveries in the first half of this year. Prior to this brand new type of aircraft entering the Allegiant fleet, we hire and train pilots, we plan our network, and we take on other preparation and infrastructure costs. These material headwinds are at a current run rate of roughly $30 million annually to operating income. At this time, we do not anticipate any MAX aircraft to be placed in service during the first half of '24, yet we continue to incur these significant expenses. Excluding these three distinct items I just outlined, our adjusted airline operating margin for the quarter would have been approximately 13%. This does not, however, change the fact that our current financial performance is not acceptable to us."", ""The good thing is we have solutions. So I'd like to talk about the key drivers of how we will return to our normal industry leading margins. The first driver is increasing peak flying. While the airline has recovered well from COVID, our peak flying is still 20% below 2019 levels. Fortunately, our pilot hiring and attrition issues have improved considerably, and we are seeing normalized staffing levels. Given these improvements, we are pushing up peak utilization and look to fully restore it by 2025, in 2025, which we expect to add roughly four points of incremental margin. incremental margin. The second driver is harnessing the full power of our Navitaire's reservation system. While the implementation of the system was more complex and took longer than we expected, we are now at the right point with Drew Wells, our Chief Revenue Officer, spearheading this initiative at this pivotal time."", ""We see a big opportunity using Navitaire's tools to drive greater ancillary revenue. Drew will talk in more detail about this platform, but we estimate enhancements to Navitaire will drive as much as three points of incremental margin at a mature state in 2025. We are also growing and improving our product offerings through other commercial opportunities in areas such as loyalty, co-brand, Allegiant Extra and our planned international expansion with Viva. Finally, the third driver is ramping up our Boeing MAX fleet. Once in service and operating at scale, we expect the MAX aircraft will provide a meaningful tailwind to our earnings. The annual operating income carrying cost of $30 million we are currently incurring will naturally subside. Furthermore, there is a 20% fuel burn savings and other advantages of this new fleet for Allegion."", ""We are working with Boeing to ensure an orderly delivery schedule. Given their extended delivery delays, our 2024 CapEx is expected to be significantly below our initial forecast. Last but certainly not least, we are very happy to report we have reached a deal with the TWU and our flight attendants on a new contract, a deal our in flight team members were proud to support. And in closing, our airline is one of the best proven models in the business. This management team is laser focused on restoring our industry leading margins. We are executing on a clear path just as outlined and further building on our strength. I'm excited about the opportunities ahead for us. And with that, I'll turn it to Micah."", ""Micah Richins: Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Maury mentioned in his opening remarks, we're extremely pleased with the progress that's been made at Sunseeker this past quarter. When we last updated you, we were in the early days of transition from a construction site to an operating resort. We still had thousands of punch list items to complete and several venues to bring online. Today, all of our outlets are online and all but a handful of the punch list items have been completed. Feedback from guests has been overwhelmingly positive with consistent month over month improvements in our Medallia NPS scores. Of note, our customers are not only impressed by the resort, but have been delighted by our wonderful team members."", ""In terms of quality of experienced drivers, the leading category is helpfulness of staff. We couldn't be more proud of them. Guests and locals alike have been highly complementary of our food and beverage offerings. Opening this many restaurants concurrently is no easy task. Despite that, all six of our specialty restaurants have satisfaction ratings over four on a scale of five with the average being 4.5. These venues, in addition to our spectacular pool experiences, allow us the ability to activate the property in meaningful ways, including sporting events like Super Bowl and the Kentucky Derby we had just this past weekend. In terms of group business, year-to-date, we've successfully hosted more than 50 groups. Our operating and services team have worked tirelessly to ensure the satisfaction of meeting planners and the attendees alike, building reputation and credibility that will pay dividends throughout the remainder of the year and certainly into 2025 and beyond."", ""In the Hospitality business, the convention segment is the most effective leading indicator of future financial performance. While our sales teams are still fielding leads for short-term in the year for the year bookings, much of their activity is now focused on planners booking 2025 and beyond. Our 2025 goal for convention room nights is 60,000. We expect to open the year with 43,000 room nights on the books and 17,000 to be booked in the year. We already have 20,000 on the books with 62,000 room nights in the funnel. In future calls, I'll provide updates on our progress. Clearly, our occupancy and our resulting financial performance is not yet where we expect it to be. The repeated shifting of our opening date made it extremely challenging for our sales teams to book convention business into Q1 and Q2 of this year."", ""Understandably, group planners are historically risk averse when it comes to new hotel products. That's why the reputational credibility I mentioned earlier is so critical. Right now, at 785 keys, we have a short-term excess room capacity challenge with the associated cost structures. As with any new venture, particularly one of this scale, it will take time and significant effort to rectify. We've assembled an executive committee of highly skilled experienced leaders, some from Vegas, some from Florida and others from around the country. Most have been through the rigors of opening multiple properties. They know what to expect, they know what to do and how to accomplish the results we anticipate going forward. With that, I'll turn it over to Scott DeAngelo."", ""Scott DeAngelo: Thanks, Micah. Our Allegiant brand and product continue to improve and are increasingly highly regarded among our customer base. Our net promoter score rose to 55 in the first quarter, that's 4 points higher than we reported last quarter and our customers rated us materially higher than all other airlines in the nation. Our high margin third-party product revenue increased nearly 30% during the first quarter compared to Q1 2023 with our always Rewards Visa card leading the way as the program surpassed 500,000 cardholders in the quarter and earned nearly $35 million in total co-brand credit card compensation, up 24% versus Q1 2023. It's also noteworthy that this program was included among Newsweek's 2024 listing of America's Best Loyalty Programs for the value it delivers to consumers as voted on by consumers."", ""We also continue to see progress during the first quarter from our marketing support for Sunseeker Resort. Primarily email marketing to our 18 million customer database, but also including prominent merchandising on our website and mobile app and onboard through our in flight magazine Nonstop Live dedicated seat back inserts. We also enabled functionality allegiant.com for customers to be able to book their stay without requiring a deposit. Bookings improved sequentially each month from an average of 140 room nights booked per day in December when the resort opened to an average of 265 room nights booked per day in March. While we're heading into a typical off peak season for Southwest Florida, we expect to continue making progress on the sales and distribution front in order to be at full strength when customers begin booking in earnest for fall and winter."", 'Lastly, our transition from legacy homegrown booking and operating systems to modern open integration technology platforms will enable us greater speed and flexibility, as we enhance our customer facing website and mobile app to improve the booking experience and maximize customer driven revenue. Specifically, as our Navitaire implementation unlocks its full set of features and functionalities as both Maury and Greg referenced and Drew will elaborate on, we will in parallel be enhancing our web and app booking experience and merchandising capabilities to drive increased take rate for high margin air ancillary products and bundles along with continued increased attachment for high margin third-party hotel, rental car and credit card. Also the expansion of newer air ancillary products such as Allegiant Extra, Lightroom Plus and Trip Insurance along with future new product conditions such as gift card, flight subscriptions and more should collectively play key roles in driving profitable key roles in driving profitable revenue growth on a per passenger basis.', ""And with that, I'll turn it over to our Chief Revenue Officer, Drew Wells."", ""Drew Wells: Thank you, Scott, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. I'm pleased to report our first quarter airline revenue of $632.5 million and TRASM of $0.1323 holds the second highest first quarter figures in Allegiant history. System ASM also increased 2% versus 1Q '23. I believe this continues to represent one of the best performances versus pre-pandemic at roughly 15% TRASM gains on over 20% ASM gains versus the first quarter of 2019, along with a record first quarter fixed fee performance. Leading the way once more was a total ancillary per passenger increase of roughly $0.50. Our core products were strong and the addition of Allianz Travel Insurance drove new opportunities in the booking path. Further, as Scott described, the always Rewards Visa card continued to drive excellent value."", ""The air ancillary portion was down slightly and we know that we're leaving value on the table here as Greg mentioned, but more on that later. The 1Q TRASM represents a 0.54% sequential increase versus 4Q '23 and in line with our revised guidance. While on a year-over-year basis, TRASM was down 4.8%, as communicated during last quarter's call, our peak spring break flying at the end of March was unit revenue positive versus the same weeks in 2023. Obviously, 2024 gets the benefit of Easter in that comparison. However, it is still a great signal that the best leisure travel periods remain resilient. Of course, there's the other side to Easter shifting. The first two weeks of March were weaker than anticipated and early April felt the pain of the spring travel season ending earlier."", ""While Easter shifts every year, it landed in March just twice between 2009 and 2019. Both of those times saw 1Q to 2Q sequential TRASM decline at least 5%. The expectations for 2Q 2024 exceed those comparisons, and we expect sequential TRASM to decline just 2.5% versus 1Q '24. This represents a year-over-year decline of roughly 5.5%. While I still expect the total ancillary per passenger to grow slightly year-over-year in the second quarter, we're accomplishing this with reduced functionality versus the same time last year. Our Navitaire cutover in late August 2023 was implemented with some non-GAAP and a path to not just bridging but improving our position. Included in those GAAP were roughly $2 per passenger and booking path ancillary functionality, impacts to our ability to collect all revenues at the airport and a handful of factors driving additional call volume to our customer care team for issues previously self serveable."", ""And the bridges have proven significantly more challenging than initially thought. The additional upside of at least another $2 per passenger we had communicated from the increased dynamic abilities had to take a back seat. I'd like to commend the entire organization for their efforts in developing, testing, finding ways to go above and beyond and continuing to make this company great through their growing pains. As we become more familiar with the platform and its capabilities, we feel it is time to take a step back and acknowledge there may be a better way to move forward. We have incredibly high conviction in the Navitaire platform when done right, and done right is what we need to do. It won't be an overnight fix, but we believe it's the right long-term decision."", ""We'll have more details around timing and value beyond what I've described here in the coming quarters. One of the ways we continue to offset the current integration headwind is with our Extra product. As the fleet grows and we gather more data, we continue to work to align our product mix and experience with what customers value most. The first quarter ended with 15 tails and the 180 seat extra layout. And thanks to our maintenance strategy team and our Mesa hangar, we expect as many as 11 additional aircrafts to be modified by the end of May. As we shift to the capacity front, our summer capacity did increase as indicated on the last call. The month of June is expected to grow approximately 7%. And while it offsets the 11% April decline, primarily associated with the Easter shift, we expect the quarter to have ASMs approximately 1% below 2Q '23."", 'Despite the delays in Boeing aircraft, our planning and ops teams have found a way to preserve the selling schedule through July and August, allowing us to maintain a mid-single digit percent ASM growth in each month and about a half hour utilization per day per aircraft increase over last summer. This is generally in line with 2018 summer utilization and a solid first step toward restoring our peak period utilization. It has taken about a year from the announcement of the pilot retention bonus to have comfort levels at the appropriate lead time to push on flying a bit harder. Candidly, we ended with enough pilots to fly a little more in March. Unfortunately, that certainty occurred too close to March to react accordingly, but it does provide support for our summer plan.', ""However, our reduced Boeing delivery expectations will impact our anticipated fourth quarter capacity and in turn our full year guidance, and we now expect 2% to 4% year-over-year ASM growth. The demand environment continues to be elevated well above pre-pandemic levels. Peaks have shown resiliency and the gaps between peak and off peak leisure demand appear normal. We see a path forward with our system implementation and other plans laid out today and are confident that we are building out the tools and processes to optimize flying, revenue and most importantly profitability. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Robert."", ""Robert Neal : Good afternoon. As you've heard from others today, our first quarter results are below our expectations. As Greg outlined, there are several contributing factors for this underperformance. We are encouraged, however, that for each of the factors Greg identified, we have a clear and actionable plan to restore our earnings potential in the coming quarters. I'll speak today to our financial results and guidance on an adjusted basis. Looking at the first quarter, we delivered a consolidated net income of $10.4 million yielding an earnings per share of $0.57. Consolidated EBITDA came in at $92.3 million generating an EBITDA margin of just over 14%. The airline business recorded a net income of $19.8 million yielding an airline only EPS of $1.08."", ""The airline produced $97 million in EBITDA during the quarter for an EBITDA margin of 15.3%. Fuel continued to pressure results coming in at $3.03 per gallon for the quarter, which was $0.18 above our initial expectations. We have seen some slight relief as of late and we're estimating second quarter fuel cost to be approximately $2.90 per gallon. Non-fuel unit costs were up 14% year-over-year. 6 points of this increase was related to the accrual for our pilot retention bonus as we were not accruing during the first quarter of 2023. Three points were driven by pilot training and loss of pilot productivity awaiting delivery of the 737 MAX Aircraft. Roughly 0.5 was attributable to the maintenance CBA that was passed last May. One point came from the timing of light engine maintenance and the remainder was from a handful of various other items."", 'Turning to the balance sheet. Our total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $1.1 billion comprised of $854 million in cash and investments and $275 million in undrawn revolvers. We made principal payments of $31.5 million during the first quarter and expect about the same during the second quarter. Net leverage was higher at the end of the quarter with net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA at 3.4 times, which included $75 million in pilot retention bonus costs. At the end of the quarter, we had prearranged financing commitments for $435 million to cover our first nine 737 MAX deliveries, which, in aggregate, provide the business with approximately $100 million in liquidity from efficient financing vehicles that those aircraft deliver. This will give us valuable flexibility with respect to aircraft financing heading into 2025, financing heading into 2025, while retaining ownership of those assets.', ""I want to thank our committed financing partners and our PDP lenders who have been particularly supportive and flexible for us in the face of the aircraft delivery delays. We retired two A320 aircraft during the quarter and placed one A320 into service. We took delivery of one A320 aircraft during the quarter. This delivery represents our last A320 under contract, and we expect the airplane to enter revenue service for our summer peak. As Greg mentioned, we're working with Boeing to devise an orderly delivery schedule, which may moderate our capacity growth in the short to midterm, but should mitigate risks to the operation, risks to our selling schedule and cost drag resulting from the disconnected timing of crew and aircraft availability."", ""At the time of our last earnings call, we anticipated our first 737 MAX Aircraft delivery to be in March. That aircraft, the first in Allegiant spec, is awaiting FAA inspection, which will need to be completed before deliveries to Allegiant can begin. We now expect this aircraft to enter revenue service during the third quarter. We are updating our delivery expectations and planning the business for delivery of six aircraft this year rather than 12 previously communicated. This estimate is not based on guidance from Boeing, but rather represents our best estimate based on information available to us today. While we remain excited about and committed to the MAX entering our fleet this year, we're very happy to own 86% of our operating fleet, providing meaningful flexibility to help manage these delays."", ""Given the reduction in expected deliveries, we have updated our full year airline CapEx to $475 million down roughly $315 million from the prior guide. As indicated last quarter, these expectations differ from our contractual obligations. Updated CapEx guidance consists of $240 million in aircraft and engine related payments, $85 million related to heavy maintenance and $165 million related to other airline CapEx. Because we're planning for six fewer aircraft to deliver in 2024, we've trimmed our full year capacity guide by one point and now expect capacity to be up 3% over the prior year. On a quarterly cadence, we're estimating second quarter capacity to remain unchanged at down 1% year-over-year, third quarter capacity to be up about 4% year-over-year and fourth quarter capacity to be up about 7% over the fourth quarter of 2023."", 'Due to further reductions in capacity this year and uncertainty around our 2025 aircraft delivery schedule, we are now reviewing our airline infrastructure and expect to make adjustments over the coming months to align with the more moderate growth trajectory. Turning to second quarter guidance. We expect the airlines produce an adjusted earnings per share of $1.50 at the midpoint of our guide, yielding an airline operating margin of around 8%. We expect second quarter CASMx to increase by approximately 7% over the second quarter of 2023. While this assumes a slight year-over-year reduction in capacity in the quarter, the increase is due primarily to increases in the salary and benefits line, including one additional month of the pilot retention bonus accrual as well as incorporating increased wage rates for our flight attendants, technicians and dispatchers as a result of new agreements or amendments.', ""It's worth noting that these labor agreements are part of our path back to incremental utilization and better productivity in the business. I want to congratulate our flight attendants on their recently ratified agreement. As we progress throughout the back half of the year, we expect CASMx to moderate into the third quarter with a slight year-over-year reduction expected in the fourth quarter. Based on Maury's commentary regarding Sunseeker and much of the second quarter being off peak for the property, we are guiding consolidated earnings per share of $0.75 for the second quarter. Before I close, I want to thank our team members for all of their efforts this quarter. Despite this financial outcome, the operation again ran safely and smoothly, thanks to your hard work."", ""And that's foundational for us as we now focus on increasing utilization in peak leisure demand periods. As we head into our peak summer schedule, thank you for all you do. And with that said, Dee, we can now turn it back to you for analyst questions."", 'Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Helane Becker from TD Cowen.', 'See also', 'Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 10 Stocks with Rising Price Targets and', ""Hidden Gems: Unveiling the 10 Stocks on Hedge Funds' Radar."", 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

(NYSE:SPR) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript May 7, 2024', ""Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc. misses on earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $ EPS, expectations were $-0.44. SPR isn't one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here)."", ""Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc. First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Candice, and I will be your coordinator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn this presentation over to Ryan Avey, Senior Director, Investor Relations and FP&A. Please proceed."", ""Ryan Avey: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I'm Ryan Avey, and with me today are Spirit's President and Chief Executive Officer, Pat Shanahan; and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mark Suchinski. Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections or goals we may include in our discussion today are likely to involve risks, including those detailed in our earnings release, in our SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement at the end of this web presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures we use when discussing our results. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Pat."", ""Patrick Shanahan: Thank you, Ryan, and good morning, everyone. Let me say at the outset that I am so proud of the Spirit team and particularly proud of what we've accomplished through teamwork. I love this industry, our customers and the people that work in it. And we set out every day to make the industrial system better while ensuring safety, quality and compliance in the supply of our products and services. For Spirit, the primary objectives of stabilizing operations, delivering on our customer commitments and strengthening our company financially have not changed. We are laser-focused and continue to make real progress towards these objectives. Spirit AeroSystems is a critical component of a global network of engineers, manufacturers, customers and governments that comprise the aerospace industry."", ""In that context, I'm going to frame our ongoing efforts. Demand for commercial air travel remains robust and firm. Our collective responsibility at Spirit is to match capacity and capability short and long term. It is a responsibility that defines the company and is at the core of our commitment to our customers. So as the industry prepares to ramp up production, we are diligently working across the industrial system to ensure we possess and demonstrate the capability to deliver on our commitments. Before moving to other topics, I would like to address talks with the Boeing company about a possible acquisition. At the beginning of March, we responded to media speculation by confirming that we are in discussions with Boeing. Those discussions continue, and as all of you understand, I'm not at liberty to comment further."", ""When and if we have something to disclose, we'll make an announcement. At our last earnings call, I spoke about Spirit's rapid response in support of the FAA NTSB Airlines and Boeing resulting from the Alaska air accident. Those actions concentrated on mitigating human factors by improving mechanic proficiency, compliance, mistake proofing and observation. Those systemic changes continue to take root as our foundational relationship with safety and quality matures. Building on that foundation of improvement, we've expanded our actions to strengthen leadership, product conformity and governance. In terms of leadership, Gregg Brown has joined our team as SVP for Global quality. Gregg is an airline operator, an airline safety and quality expert and authority in the management of the FAA's safety management system."", ""He most recently was the Vice President of Technical Operations at JetBlue. Gregg possesses expertise for Airbus and Boeing products having served in the industry and at Southwest Airlines for almost 4 decades. Steps to strengthen product conformity have been significant. The decision was made to fundamentally change the inspection process. This change aligns Spirit and Boeing efforts into a joint inspection. Partnering with Boeing, this transformative undertaking was industrialized in 34 days. Today, working shoulder to shoulder with a standardized 26 zone product verification process, the team's verify conformity on the 737. Each week, the process improves in tandem with quality results being fed back to the teams working in station. Ultimately, our goal is not to streamline this operation but to move it further upstream to where the work is performed."", ""In the interim, utilizing end-to-end digital feedback and analytics, we are accelerating the quality improvements initiated in the first quarter. With critical new building blocks, process changes and insight, we have further reexamined governance. Breakthrough performance and safety and quality will be realized and sustained if teams at the point of production own their operations. We are moving from the office to the factory floor. We're enabling integrated product teams composed of quality assurance, manufacturing engineering, factory operations, supplier management and the customer. This form of governance, which is not new to our industry, provides the requisite authorities, resources, inspiration and motivation that unlocks discretionary effort."", 'This change in governance is early stage, but has the greatest potential. Now I will provide context on cash usage for the quarter. As Boeing mentioned on their call, they deliberately slowed 737 production below 38 per month to incorporate improvements to quality and safety management systems, including reducing traveled work and addressing supplier nonconformances. The inspection process changed by Boeing in effect paused our ability to receive payment for completed fuselages. The implementation of the product verification required that we inspect all the fuselage stored in ship in place utilizing the new conformity process. This represents a total of 54 ship-in place units that needed to flow through the newly established process beginning March 1.', ""In the quarter, we produced 89 units and delivered 44 units prior to implementing the new process. The result was an increase of 45 fuselages to our work in process. To offset the lack of payment but recognizing the completion of fuselages, Boeing Advanced Spirit $425 million to be repaid in the third quarter as the production system returns to equilibrium. We appreciate greatly Boeing's support operationally and financially as we strengthen the industrial system. Boeing is also modifying 787 deliveries due to supply chain challenges. Mark will provide additional detail. However, with the 737 production rate currently at 31 airplanes per month and 787 deliveries approximately 25% below original plans, we will make near-term adjustments to our supply chain to ensure optimal levels of inventory and rate capability."", ""We are closely coordinating with our supplier partners to mitigate the short-term disruption. Our intent is to quickly resynchronize the industrial system while still balancing the capacity and capability to snap back to future production rate increases. The Spirit team is focused on driving our safety and quality efforts, synchronizing supplier partner operations and aligning to meet our commitments to defense customers Airbus and Boeing. Turning to Airbus, as we've discussed on earnings calls over the past year, we've been attempting to reach a commercial agreement in the best interest of both companies. These conversations have yet to result in an agreement. As a result of this impact and the continued pressure on meeting the delivery targets demanded by the rapid rate in the Airbus A350 and 220 programs, we booked significant losses this quarter, including net incremental losses for anticipated performance obligations extending beyond 2026."", ""The strain on the supply chain being experienced by Spirit and other suppliers is both commercial and an operational risk. We have risen to the challenge thus far, and we'll continue to work with Airbus to ensure that quality and safety remain the foremost considerations. And to close, while it's not been the focus of my opening remarks today, I want to highlight the strong performance of the Defense and Aftermarket teams. They continue to execute day in and day out and are performing to their commitments operationally and financially. With that, let me turn the call over to Mark, who will take you through the financials before we open up the call to Q&A. Mark?"", ""Mark Suchinski: Thank you, Pat. And good morning, everyone. As Pat covered in his opening remarks, there have been a number of events that have occurred since our last earnings call. I want to discuss the financial impacts of these items before getting into the first quarter results. First, the implementation of Boeing's product verification process on the 737 program, including moving inspections and rework teams from [indiscernible] Wichita while no longer allowing travel work. This has been a collaborative effort to enhance quality and eliminate rework, but consequently has created delayed delivery acceptance in our factories, which has led to the buildup of undelivered units, higher levels of inventory and contract assets and lower cash flow."", ""We are working with Boeing to mitigate the slowdown resulting from the process changes. And despite the slow start, we are seeing signs of improvement. And in the long term, expect the benefit to be more synchronized with our customers' inspection process. Over the next few quarters, we expect to have our production systems aligned and built up units delivered. Additionally, we have incurred factory and supply chain costs that were incurred to align with the higher 737 production rate, which has now been delayed. Our current rate is approximately 31 aircraft per month, and we now expect to remain at the lower than planned rate throughout the rest of the year. Similarly, on the 787 program, we are now anticipating delivering approximately 55 units during 2024, down from our original plan of approximately 80."", ""All of these items will have a negative impact on cash flow throughout the year, but I want you to know that we are strongly focused on liquidity and actions to improve our current position. Now let me take you through the details of our first quarter financial results. So let's move to Slide #2. Revenue for the quarter was $1.7 billion, up 19% from the first quarter of 2023. The year-over-year improvement was primarily due to higher production on our Commercial programs and increased Defense & Space revenues. Overall deliveries in the quarter decreased 11% year-over-year as a result of fewer deliveries recorded on the 737 program due to the reasons I described in my opening remarks. The in-process and completed 737 fuselages that have not been through the new source inspection process are recorded as contract assets and not counted towards our ship set deliveries until accepted."", ""The overtime accounting revenue recognition on these units has been reflected in our quarterly financial results. Now let's turn our attention to EPS. We reported earnings per share of a negative $5.31 compared to negative $2.68 in the first quarter of 2023. Excluding certain items, adjusted EPS was negative $3.93 compared to negative $1.69 in the prior year. Operating margin was lower compared to the same period of 2023, largely driven by higher unfavorable changes in estimates during the first quarter of 2024. First quarter net forward losses were $495 million and unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments were $39 million. This is compared to $110 million of forward losses and $12 million of unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments in the first quarter of 2023."", 'The current quarter 4 losses were primarily driven by A350 and A220 programs of $281 million and $167 million, respectively. I know these are large losses but are really due to the inability to reach a conclusion to commercial negotiations with Airbus. And as a result, we were required to adjust our assumptions and record forward losses on the A220 and A350 programs, which drove $373 million of total losses. This includes forward losses through 2025, our current accounting contract as well as losses for anticipated performance obligations beyond 2026. The remainder of the forward losses were a result of production cost growth and additional firm orders. Additionally, the 787 program drove $34 million of forward losses due to supply chain and labor cost growth to support future higher production rates.', 'The unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments primarily related to increased 737 costs associated with the product verification process changes, which caused delayed delivery acceptances and a significant buildup of undelivered units in Wichita. Now turning to free cash flow. Free cash flow usage for the quarter was $444 million compared to free cash flow usage of $69 million in the first quarter of 2023, primarily caused by disruption to the 737 production and delivery delay experienced in the period. Having a large number of unbilled 737 units built during the first quarter had a significant negative impact on our first quarter free cash flow. Once these units can be fully inspected under the new product verification process, they will be considered delivered, and we can collect the cash earned on those units.', ""The prior year free cash flow reflects $180 million surplus cash payment received related to the termination of the pension value Plan A. Now with that, let's turn to our cash and debt balances on Slide 3. We ended the quarter with $352 million of cash, which reflects the unfavorable impacts of the disruption experienced on the 737 production and delivery process. We ended the quarter with $4.1 billion of debt. In April, we entered into an MOA with Boeing to provide cash advances totaling $425 million. These funds were used to address Spirit's high levels of inventory and contract assets, lower operational cash flows, decreased deliveries and higher factory costs attributed to the change in the product verification process and the FAA's imposition of limitations on the Boeing increased production rates."", ""This advance will be reflected in the second quarter financial results and will be treated as financing activity on the statement of cash flows. As I mentioned in my remarks, we are strongly focused on liquidity and our working plans to improve our current position. Next, let's discuss our quarterly segment performance, along with the Commercial segment on Slide 4. Even with the 737 disruption impacts, Commercial revenue increased compared to the same period of 2023, primarily due to higher production across most of our programs. Quarterly operating margin decreased compared to the first quarter of 2023, primarily driven by higher changes in estimates recorded in the current period. These changes in estimates included net forward losses of $494 million, which were largely driven by the change in assumptions on our conversations with Airbus and unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $39 million."", ""In comparison, during the first quarter of 2023, the segment recorded charges of $110 million of forward losses and $11 million of unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments. Next, let's turn to Defense & Space segment on Slide 5. We are especially pleased with the performance by the Defense & Space teams this quarter. Revenue grew to $251 million due to higher activity on development and classified programs as well as the Sikorsky CH-53K and FLRAA programs. Operating margin of 13% in the first quarter increased compared to the same period of 2023, primarily due to higher classified program activities and strong execution by the team. For our Aftermarket segment results, let's now turn to Slide 6. Aftermarket had another solid quarter with revenue of $96 million, up slightly over the prior year, primarily due to higher spare parts sales."", ""Operating margin in the first quarter of 2024 decreased compared to the first quarter of '23, primarily due to lower MRO activity during the current period. With that, we will be happy to take your questions."", 'See also', '10 Best Carfax Alternatives to Check Vehicle History and', '10 Cathie Wood Stocks Insiders are Selling.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

The company is benefiting from a robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. Its sustained focus on aligning products with customer needs is driving the top line.Continued deal wins in the international market are another growth driver. The buyout of Slack has positioned the company as a leader in enterprise team collaboration and improved its competitive standing versus Microsoft Teams.

The divestment strategy aims to reach $25 billion by 2025, enhancing the balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders.However, a high debt-to-capitalization ratio raises financial flexibility and balance sheet concerns. Also, despite resolving significant litigation expenses from the 2010 oil spill, BP had to sell valuable assets. These divestitures could potentially limit future cash generation. Refining margins may face pressure due to narrower crude differentials.(You can read the full research report on BP here >>>)Southern Company’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry over the past year (+7.2% vs. +1.7%).

As it is, the utility sector remains sensitive to interest rate fluctuations and market sentiment. Therefore, Southern Company warrants a cautious stance from the investors.(You can read the full research report on Southern Company here >>>)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include PayPal Holdings, Inc.

One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.', ""Over half a decade, TE Connectivity managed to grow its earnings per share at 5.6% a year. This EPS growth is lower than the 10% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days.

Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of TE Connectivity, it has a TSR of 76% for the last 5 years.

Thanks to high-stake media deals and a big push into building a global fanbase, the NFL has built the world’s largest sports league — valued at $163 billion across its 32 teams, according to Forbes. Its lead in the industry is no accident. It’s the result of careful business branding, exclusive sponsorships, expanding the interests of an already massive audience, and adjusting to the changing landscape of the sport. In the 2023-24 season alone, the NFL partnered with 48 brands, holding top deals with EA Sports (EA), Nike (NKE) and Verizon (VZ), while generating over $11 billion from broadcasters, including Peacock, Amazon (AMZN), and ESPN, according to GlobalData. The 2024 Super Bowl also became the most-watched television program in US history. However, the NFL wouldn't exist, much less be the powerhouse it is today, without the league’s nearly 1,700 players. Troy Vincent is the one who is looking out for them on the field. As Executive Vice President of Football Operations, Vincent heads player development and oversees new and, at times, risky rules to a game loved and watched by millions, with one goal in mind — building on the success of the NFL through investing in its players.Before joining the C-suite, Vincent got his start in the NFL with the Miami Dolphins as a rookie cornerback in 1992. But NFL fans know him best from his time playing for the Philadelphia Eagles, where \u200b\u200bhe made five consecutive Pro Bowls."", 'Yahoo Finance’s Josh Lipton visits the NFL headquarters and is later invited to Vincent’s family home in Purcellville, Virginia to get a closer look at the forces driving Vincent’s leadership and the business behind ‘America’s sport.’', 'For more on our Lead This Way Series, click here, and tune in to Yahoo Finance every Thursday.', ""JOSH LIPTON: The NFL needs no introduction… and neither does Troy Vincent, former Philadelphia Eagles cornerback turned NFL insider. As Executive Vice President of Football Operations in a league of 32 teams - valued at 163 billion dollars - Vincent oversees what's most critical to the game - its rules."", 'TROY VINCENT: Leadership is lonely. Your compromises of today become your standards of tomorrow.', ""JOSH LIPTON: Behind the business of America's sport, football operations is tasked with monitoring policies on the field to protect players without damaging the popularity of the game. And Vincent is doing it at a time when the NFL’s coaching and player development are being questioned, even by former quarterback legend, Tom Brady. With the NFL’s commercial success and growing fanbase, there’s a reason why it’s often hailed as one of the country’s greatest unifiers. But there is no NFL without its nearly 1,700 players and Vincent…committed to the athletes and preserving the integrity of the game. Yahoo Finance met with Vincent at the NFL headquarters - in New York City - to get a closer look at the challenges and rewards of heading the operations of the world’s largest sports league."", 'TROY VINCENT: So Josh, this is where - the Art McNally GameDay Central - is where I probably spend during the season, 98 percent of my time.', 'JOSH LIPTON: So this is when I hear Aikman, Joe Buck say…', 'TROY VINCENT: Anytime you hear an announcer, this play is going back to New York, or is being reviewed in New York.', 'JOSH LIPTON: Right in here.', 'TROY VINCENT: This is where we’re talking about.', ""JOSH LIPTON: Let’s go…one thing’s for sure… Vincent is not soft about football, even when running new and, at times, risky policies to a game loved and watched by millions - with one goal in mind - building on the success of the league by investing in its players. You want policies and procedures on the field that are going to protect players, reduce risk. You also, though, want to maintain the spirit of the game that Americans love, which is, listen, it's the pace, it's the energy, it's the aggression, right? How do you kind of think about balancing those goals?"", ""TROY VINCENT: So, I'm in a unique position from my former years as being on the field, as being a, being a participant, playing the game, playing at a high level. And now my current role as a gatekeeper, I'm one of many gatekeepers, but the individual under Commissioner Goodell's leadership to be responsible for Josh. I would say it's the balance of, it's the right integration. It's protecting, preserving the game that Americans and those abroad have come to love. They love points, they love the excitement, they love them. They love these memorable moments while being responsible of protecting players from unnecessary risk. And we have a comprehensive approach to that. I appreciate it's a different game today. I'll start with, it's a different game today. It's a better game for, I think it's a better game today. And it's a much safer game today. Why? The players are more athletic than they've ever, than than we've ever seen. They're bigger, they're faster, they're stronger, they're stronger. The pace is much more fluid, efficient. Great coaching. The players are so athletic, they're skill level was so high. But I come from an era where there were things that we did that I did, personally, things I was taught that really had no place in the game."", 'JOSH LIPTON: An example?', 'TROY VINCENT: Like just using the helmet as a weapon, like trying to really inflict harm to your opponent. That was the mentality.', 'JOSH LIPTON: Before joining the executive team, Vincent got his start in the NFL as a first round pick in the 1992 draft to play with the Miami Dolphins. As a cornerback, he helped the Dolphins reach the AFC Championship game his rookie year, but Vincent really made his mark when he signed with the Philadelphia Eagles, where he made five consecutive Pro Bowls. But, as Vincent says, football was a different game in his time.', ""TROY VINCENT: There was an era of football that we grew to love, self included, that was just, there was a brutality that was just like, it was acceptable. Now, with science and engineering and research we've seen, it's really about what does life look like? Because a 21 to 22-year-old has no clue of what life looks like or will feel like at the age of 40, 50, or 60. That's our responsibility as legends, as gatekeepers to protect that player from unnecessary risk."", ""JOSH LIPTON: As Vincent puts it, encouraging player safety while at the same time maintaining the pace and aggression of the game fans love is a careful balancing act. In 2024, the hip-drop tackle was banned after the NFL found injury rates were 25 times higher when a tackler wraps a runner, unweights himself, and traps his opponent's legs. Rule changes have left some fans and players concerned the game has been watered down and is not as exciting as it used to be. According to Sportsbook Review, 82 percent of fans believe rules and penalties should be changed."", ""TOM BRADY: “I think there's a lot of mediocrity in today's NFL.”"", 'JOSH LIPTON: In 2023, former quarterback Tom Brady didn’t hold back on voicing his concerns with the direction of the league.', 'TOM BRADY: “The rules have allowed a lot of bad habits to get into the actual performance of the game.”', ""TROY VINCENT: I respect Tom and Tom has earned that right to voice his opinion, like others. And they should - challenge, hold us accountable as gatekeepers. In Tom's era, the quarterback, you didn't have the majority of the quarterbacks weren't dual threats, pocket passers. We've seen not a handful, you know, when, but when you look at the way the rosters, from your Josh Allens to your Patrick Mahomes, your Lamar Jackson’s, your Russell Wilson’s, these threat quarterbacks, your Justin Fields, these individuals - it's a different era in quarterback play."", 'JOSH LIPTON: In the offseason, Vincent and the NFL Competition Committee assess what changes need to be made for the next season. And on March 26th, NFL owners approved a new rule that is turning what was called a “dead play” into an integral part of the game again… kickoffs. As opposed to a traditional running start, the kicker will kick off from his 35-yard line and the rest of the kicking team will line up at their opponent’s 40-yard line. The play begins when the ball is either caught or hits the ground in the landing zone. The goal? Create an exciting play with higher returns while also reducing injuries.', ""TROY VINCENT: It's the space and speed. It's when the player has the ability, and our players are now - they're running 18 to 22 miles an hour when they have that space to build up that kind of speed. And then you make the impact, man, that's not what we want. We all know as fans, when you have an explosive kickoff play, it changes the atmosphere. Not only in the stadium, it changes the momentum of the game. We want to bring those elements back. They should be back."", ""JOSH LIPTON: The new kickoff model will give return opportunities to players with big-play potential. And the impact was immediate with the Pittsburgh Steelers signing a two-year, six million dollar contract for Cordarrelle Patterson, who had a record nine kickoff return touchdowns during the 2023 season.The new rule even influenced draft-day decisions, the lifeline for keeping the league fresh and competitive, with Texas A&M’s Ainias smith, Penn State’s Daequan Hardy, and University of Texas’s Xavier Worthy - selected for their speed and return capability. On top of athletic performance, player development and coaching are critical in determining whether a rookie will thrive. And Vincent's work with players isn't just about what happens on the field - helping them plan for life after football is just as important."", ""TROY VINCENT: I was always concerned about the challenges of transition. And players, you know, you go from college and now you spend the next few years - I had the opportunity to play at 15 - a sport that we love - kid’s game, man's body. And you don't have the time to develop some of those skills that you would get in an internship or that you would get in a normal nine to five job. So creating programs or initiatives to allow the player to at least learn some skills around transition or things that he may have interest in. So from our business entrepreneurship programs, broadcast boot camp, and now we're at a different era, like the game has evolved. Players are now being paid in high school. At the collegiate level, the accessibility to information is at their fingertips. Many more entrepreneurs, players wanting to own their own media company. So we've had to adjust what the players' interests are based off of where they are. Some of them are coming into the league as rookies, financially stable. Financial literacy being taught at the high school collegiate level is different. So that is something that's dear to my heart personally, is making sure that - working with the players association, working with the clubs that we're all in alignment with player transition. It’s going to happen. The inevitable is going to happen. And oftentimes that transition happens not by your choice. And are you ready? And do you have the skills to transition into what we say, ‘the new normal’?"", ""JOSH LIPTON: Football is even bigger than the game itself. The NFL adds 5 billion dollars to the US economy every year. And the 2024 super bowl became the most watched television program in US history. Its dominance is no accident. It's the result of strategic media deals and exclusive sponsorships. Last season alone, the NFL was partnered with 48 brands, holding top deals with EA sports, Nike and Verizon, while generating over 11 billion dollars from broadcasters, including Peacock, Amazon, and ESPN. It’s more than just a pastime - it’s become a cultural phenomenon bringing together millions of fans - even when the country feels most divided. As Executive Vice President, Vincent says it’s a tremendous responsibility to support the league’s powerhouse operations, but also a shared one."", ""TROY VINCENT: We're working together to try to come together to win a football game and, and create some excitement. I hope your lips to God's ears, that the game can continue to be a positive force for just people coming together, cheering for their club, cheering for their favorite players at the same time. It's a delicate balance, a delicate integration of things that we believe that are important for the player, important for the club that we come together to try to resolve those things together. It's not always perfect and there is disruption that occurs, but we understand the platform that the National Football League has on the broader society."", 'JOSH LIPTON: A platform that goes well beyond revenue and profits and taps into the inspiration and drive that not only got Vincent into the league, but got him to where he is today.', ""TROY VINCENT: I believe everything that I've learned in my current role are attributes and things that I learned in athletics. What you did on Sundays, Mondays, and Thursdays, and how you showed up on game day was a reflection of what you did during the week. If you didn't practice, if you didn't detail your work, if you lacked in on preparation with video review, game preparation, it showed up on Sunday. It showed up on Monday night and Thursday night. So paying attention to detail, falling in love with the basics every single day - following this process, prepares you to have success when the lights are on. But going from the playing field to the boardroom, those same skills were natural transitions in the corporate area. Being a good listener. Being a good communicator, not trying to be the loudest voice or the most talkative voice in the room. Being a collaborator, being a partner, showing up every day. Where I began, I didn't know what a leader was. My own personal experience of - how do you influence, how do you show up the same all the time? How do you get an individual or a team of folks to believe in what you're saying? Kind of galvanize all towards one common goal? Initially - performance in the world of sport. When you performed, oftentimes that kind of evolved you to a leadership level by producing on the field. But then as I matured, there was a parallel of on-field performance with literally what the impact you were making on decisions that were not on the field, whether they were in the community or inside the locker room, being a locker room leader around areas of the collective bargaining agreement, hours, wages, working conditions, and player rights, family rights. Now being mature in my current role, 15 years here now at the National Football League, it's really about people and getting people to believe in what your objectives are, what your goals are, and why is important for them to at least hear what you're saying and buy into moving in that same direction.""]"

During this period, the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, which Wells Fargo falls in, has gained 0.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?"", ""While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making."", 'Revisions to Earnings Estimates', ""Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements."", 'Wells Fargo is expected to post earnings of $1.25 per share for the current quarter, representing no change from the year-ago quarter.

Over the past month, the estimate has changed +3%.', ""Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Telecom giant AT&T (NYSE: T) and pharmaceutical titan Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) scan as incredible bargains for long-term, income-oriented investors. Read on to find out more about these two no-brainer dividend stocks.', ""AT&T's journey can be likened to a phoenix rising from the ashes. Over the past decade, the telecom behemoth's stock price has seen a 36% decline. This is attributable to a series of missteps, including an overreach into the entertainment sector, a burdensome debt pile, the rise of budget-friendly rivals, and potential legal entanglements linked to its aging infrastructure."", ""Yet there's a renewed sense of optimism surrounding the company. Morningstar analyst Michael Hodel, for example, recently reaffirmed his $23 fair-value estimate for AT&T's stock, buoyed by the company's robust first-quarter results. This fair-value estimate suggests an upside potential of 33.9% from the stock's current price."", 'What are the drivers of this positive outlook? AT&T is showing signs of reaching an inflection point in its core operations, highlighted by a 9% reduction in customer disconnections in Q1 of 2024, compared to the previous year. Additionally, the company saw a 2.2% uptick in its customer base and a 0.9% increase in revenue per subscriber during the same period.', ""What's the main reason to consider buying shares? Beyond the attractive yield, AT&T stock is currently valued at just 9x trailing earnings, a stark contrast to the S&P 500's multiple of nearly 25x. AT&T thus appears to be an incredible bargain, particularly when considering its generous dividend yield."", ""As for risks, the U.S. telecom sector could be ripe for disruption by tech-savvy entities with deep pockets. Nevertheless, AT&T's substantial investments in 5G technology and fiber optics should provide a safeguard from unforeseen industry shake-ups."", ""All told, AT&T is exhibiting a healthy downward trend in customer churn, making strides in reducing debt, and investing in infrastructure that promises sustained growth over the long term. While the telecom industry isn't immune to disruption, AT&T's proactive measures have so far kept such threats at bay, positioning it as a potentially potent value and income play."", 'Pfizer is charting a new course. After navigating through the turbulent waters of 2023 and the early months of 2024, the pharmaceutical behemoth is starting to emerge as a compelling value play.', ""The company's stock felt the pressure from a downturn in COVID-19 product sales last year, and the investment community expressed dissatisfaction with Pfizer's acquisition strategy, which didn't deliver the expected high-impact results. However, Pfizer's strategic pivot to focus on oncology as its primary growth driver is likely to be a wise long-term decision."", 'The rationale for this move is clear: An aging global population is expected to lead to an increase in cancer rates. Pfizer is preparing to meet this challenge by developing and launching several new anti-cancer agents over the coming years.', ""The oncology market is known for its strong pricing power, with cancer drugs typically carrying high price tags and significant margins. While Pfizer's recent acquisitions haven't produced a mega-blockbuster akin to Merck's Keytruda, its broad oncology pipeline is set to be a central pillar of growth."", ""For investors looking for deep value, Pfizer's stock, trading at just 12.7x forward earnings, represents a tremendous opportunity.

It’s also a popular target for short sellers.Moderna Chief Executive Officer Stéphane Bancel swats away the skepticism, portraying a seemingly unshakeable belief in what he calls the mRNA “platform.”', '“The platform is working,” he said at the company’s Vaccines Day, a presentation to investors in late March. “The platform has not only helped already hundreds of millions of people around the world — because billions of people got a vaccine during Covid — but this is just the beginning.” As for Moderna’s RSV shot, it has never gone through head-to-head clinical trials against competitors, so it’s not fair to compare them, according to the company. “We have a very strong efficacy profile,” Bancel said.', 'Moderna is all in on mRNA. Each of the more than 40 drugs in its pipeline relies on the technology. The company’s new Cambridge, Massachusetts, headquarters welcomes visitors with a giant screen featuring a rotating mRNA molecule. “Everybody that works here wakes up in the morning thinking about mRNA,” said Kyle Holen, Moderna’s head of development for oncology and therapeutics.', 'The biotech’s most ambitious goal is to develop personalized cancer vaccines that teach the immune system to fight off the disease. That would indeed be both a scientific breakthrough and could bring in more than $10 billion in annual sales, depending on how many tumors they work in, according to JPMorgan Securities analyst Jessica Fye. Though, in the notoriously fickle world of drug development, these treatments could be years away — if they come to fruition at all.', '“We want to stay very focused on mRNA,” Bancel says in an interview.', 'Most drugmakers don’t stake their business on a single scientific approach. Even BioNTech SE, which developed with Pfizer an mRNA-powered Covid shot, has bulked up its pipeline with other types of treatments. Its first non-Covid product will likely be one that doesn’t use mRNA, BioNTech says.', 'Bancel’s “maniacal focus” — as former Moderna Chief Medical Officer Tal Zaks puts it — paid off during the pandemic. But it has at times come at the expense of the practicalities of running a company, according to people who’ve worked with him. Some former employees say they grew frustrated with his unrealistic expectations, unwillingness to accept alternatives and blunt demeanor. Bancel’s demanding leadership style has also led to high executive turnover. The company has gone through two chief commercial officers in three years. In December, Bancel made the unusual move to put himself in the job.', 'Moderna is bleeding money. Covid vaccine sales have evaporated from almost $20 billion a year to about a third of that. Meanwhile, the company’s nearly $5 billion research and development budget ate up about 70% of its 2023 revenue. The company is expected to lose about $3 billion this year and doesn’t expect to break even until 2026.', 'Bancel’s long-term vision has some investors hanging on — the stock is up about 20% so far this year on high hopes for its cancer treatments.', ""In the short-term, the biotech doesn’t have much new to offer. Eight months ago, Moderna president Stephen Hoge said the company's goal was to file “very quickly” for accelerated approval for its flu vaccine. It has yet to do so. Meanwhile, a combination Covid, flu and RSV shot has faded into the background, only mentioned briefly at the end of Vaccines Day."", 'Moderna spokesperson Chris Ridley said the goal is to seek regulatory approval for the flu shot this year. The triple shot is “still a goal,” he said, but the company is prioritizing the individual components and dual combination shots.', 'Moderna could scale back its large pipeline to appease those who are restless for a return to profits. Bancel says he’d rather take outside investment than limit his ambitions, even if it means less upside for Moderna. In March, Moderna said Blackstone Life Sciences agreed to provide funding of up to $750 million for its flu program. If a vaccine does make it to the market, Blackstone will get a return based on undisclosed commercial milestones and “low-single digit” royalties.', '“We think it’s better for society and for shareholders to partner with somebody rather than leave an asset on the shelf if you can\'t afford it,"" Bancel says.', 'In the meantime, he faces an uphill battle in winning RSV contracts. Pfizer and GSK have had a year to establish relationships with pharmacy chains that make up most of the RSV market. Last year, GSK’s RSV vaccine drove about $1.5 billion in sales and Pfizer’s about $900 million. For Moderna, a lot rides on how often public health officials recommend people get the shots. Preliminary data suggests competitors’ jabs may only have to be taken every other year.', 'Bancel hopes to outmaneuver his rivals through what he calls “customer intimacy.” It’s a strategy he used after the US government stopped buying Covid shots for all Americans in 2023 and Moderna actually had to go out and sell its vaccine commercially for the first time. It helped the company go from 37% of the US retail market for Covid in 2022 to almost half last year.', 'In recent months, the CEO has spent time visiting pharmacies, listening for things that could give Moderna an edge when competing for contracts with RSV. One thing he noticed: His competitors’ vaccines come in unwieldy packaging. “If you look at the box, it’s huge,” says Bancel. “If you’re a pharmacist at the local CVS or Walgreens store and you don’t have enough freezer space, that’s a problem.” Moderna’s box will be smaller, according to the company.', 'The shot’s most important innovation is that it will be the only one that comes in a pre-filled syringe — a “game changer” for pharmacists, according to Bancel. Moderna’s research has found that providers can administer up to four times more doses per hour using its ready-made injection than those that take multiple steps to prepare, like the GSK and Pfizer shots.', 'Pharmacists say they’d welcome a simpler process, but there are higher priorities when choosing which shot to buy, like price and insurance coverage. Crucially, Moderna’s RSV shot doesn’t have a distinction that helped boost its Covid sales: Claims of a better shot.', ""Competitors are quick to point to data showing that the efficacy of Moderna’s RSV vaccine appeared to decline more quickly than its rivals. In clinical trials, Moderna’s shot saw a 25% decline after 8.6 months, while GSK’s saw a 7% decline after 14 months, according an analysis from TD Cowen. “The data, unfortunately, you know, wasn't very good,” Mikael Dolsten, Pfizer’s president of research and development, said in an interview. “Moderna didn't even hold up a full season.”"", 'How long mRNA vaccines protect people from disease remains “the big asterisk” on the technology’s capabilities, said Peter Hotez, a vaccine expert and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. If researchers can’t figure out how to make mRNA more durable, its use cases will be limited, he said.', ""Bancel doesn’t believe the platform has limitations. “We want to be the best mRNA company in the world and have the broadest pipeline,” he says. “That's how we think we’re going to have the biggest impact on patients.”"", '--With assistance from Naomi Kresge and Madison Muller.', 'Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek', 'How Uniqlo’s ‘Millennial Birkin’ Is Beating Designer Bags', 'Tim Cook Can’t Run Apple Forever.

OPKO Health, Inc. isn’t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).', ""Operator: Hello, and welcome to the OPKO Health First Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host today, Yvonne Briggs. Please go ahead."", ""Yvonne Briggs: Thank you, operator, and good afternoon. This is Yvonne Briggs with LHA. Thank you all for joining today's call to discuss OPKO Health's financial results for the first quarter of 2024. I'd like to remind you that any statements made during this call by management other than statements of historical fact will be considered forward-looking and as such will be subject to risks and uncertainties that can materially affect the company's expected results. Those forward-looking statements include, without limitation, the various risks described in the company's SEC filings, including the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and in subsequently filed SEC reports. This conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, May 7, 2024."", ""Except as required by law, OPKO undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call. Before we begin, let me review the format for today's call. Dr. Phillip Frost, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will open the call. Dr. Elias Zerhouni, Vice Chairman and President, will then provide an overview of BioReference Health, followed by OPKO's pharmaceutical business. And after that, Adam Logal, OPKO's CFO, will review the company's first quarter financial results and then will open the call to questions. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Dr. Frost."", ""Phil Frost: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. In March, we announced an agreement to sell certain assets of BioReference Health to Labcorp for $237.5 million. The assets included BioReference's clinical diagnostics and women's health testing services outside of New York and New Jersey. The transaction was specifically structured in a manner so as to increase the likelihood of obtaining expedited clearance from antitrust regulators. But it also streamlines the remaining operations to advance the path to profitability for our diagnostic segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of this year, pending FTC clearance. In general, our long-acting growth hormone therapy continues to gain traction as our global commercial partner, Pfizer, expands its launch of the product in over 40 global markets."", 'This once-weekly injection product to treat growth hormone deficiency is the first new chemical entity developed at OPKO Biologics in Israel, where we now have other preclinical candidates under development. One is a long-acting form of oxyntomodulin analog, which I mentioned in our last quarterly call. The pegylated form of this active peptide has been shown to be effective and safe in treating diabetes and obesity in a Phase 2 study in over 450 patients. The new long-acting form is expected to have the same pharmacology profile as the pegylated form, but permits administering larger doses. We have in development a long-acting hGH antagonist for the treatment of acromegaly caused by the excessive secretion of growth hormone and IGF-1. We are progressing in our work with Entera Bio to develop oral forms of oxyntomodulin and a GLP-2 analog for short bowel syndrome and other disorders involving nutrient malabsorption.', ""We look forward to keep you apprised of progress with these promising programs. ModeX continues to advance its development work, and two programs are on track to enter the clinic this year, our Epstein-Barr vaccine, licensed to Merck, and our multispecific oncology antibody, which has received FDA clearance for a Phase 1 trial. Our collaboration with BARDA is moving forward and provides non-dilutive financing to develop multispecific antibodies against COVID. As work progresses on this first indication, we will begin to explore alternative targets to tackle other biodefense threats, such as influenza. With that brief overview, I'll turn it over to Elias. Elias?"", ""Elias Zerhouni: Well, thank you, Phil, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start by apologizing if you hear background noise. I'm in a noisy environment at the airport. But as Phil said, we were very pleased to announce our agreement with Labcorp to sell certain assets of BioReference Health for a cash purchase price of 237.5 million. These assets generate approximately $100 million in annual revenue and include patient service standards, certain customer contracts, and operating assets associated with testing services focused on clinical diagnostics and women's health across the U.S., but outside of New York and New Jersey. We will retain our national oncology and urology franchises and our diagnostic services in New York and New Jersey."", ""This complements our efforts to improve efficiencies and enhance the productivity of operations. This transaction will streamline our laboratory services business and support our work to reestablish profitability in the near future. As Phil mentioned, we expect the sale to close in the second half of 2024, subject to customary closing conditions and applicable regulatory approvals. As an ongoing initiative, we continue to improve BioReference's performance and in turn build value. Our focus remains on initiatives to reduce costs, improve efficiency and enhance productivity. In addition, we seek to bolster growth through the expansion of insurance coverage in our higher value specialty segments of oncology and urology, with particular focus on our proprietary 4Kscore Test."", 'As you know, the 4Kscore Test was first introduced in 2014 as a laboratory-developed test. As you know, FDA published new rules to reform the regulation of lab-developed tests. This will have a minimal impact on BioReference Health, as all our tests are approved by New York state regulators who are exempted from the announced FDA reform. In December 2021, I would like to remind you, 4Kscore was approved by the FDA, supported by its analytical and clinical data. FDA concluded that the 4Kscore Test had the appropriate sensitivity of 96.9% and negative predictive value of 95.9% to contribute to an overall beneficial clinical decision as to whether a prostate biopsy should be performed and accordingly minimize unnecessary biopsies without excess risk of missing clinically significant prostate cancers.', ""In more than 100 independent publications by urologists since then, the 4Kscore has ranked as the best-performing biomarker test for the assessment of risk probability for aggressive prostate cancer. Our urology team delivers strong growth in 4Kscore Test volumes in the first quarter, and we expect these volumes to build as the test is included now in various clinical guidelines for early detection of prostate cancer for follow-up after PSA screening for initial and repeat biopsy risk stratification. In regard to Rayaldee, the program continues to enjoy stable demand, which we hope will grow with new data that Rayaldee may delay the onset of dialysis according to our most recent analysis. In oncology, we are pleased with GenPath's performance due to its innovative testing platform with an expanded hematological malignancy panel and very competitive turnaround times."", ""We continue to see strong growth in our oncology business with over 12% growth in volume Q1 2024 versus Q1 2023. Much of this growth was through collaborations with large cancer centers and mid-level health systems. As health systems are challenged with cost and staffing in the oncology space, they are looking for a reference laboratory to work with for their testing, opening up possibilities for BioReference Health. GenPath has been able to meet their needs with our enhanced and comprehensive menu across all stages of care. This includes the internalization of our hereditary cancer business in late Q4 2023, which now offers clients an internal solution with fast turnaround times for timely decision-making. We continue to expand our testing portfolio and expect new tests in Q2 to complement our current OncoCyte advance and onco-risk portfolio, which will enable GenPath Oncology to evaluate guideline-recommended genetic components of a prostate's cancer and keep us at the forefront of precision oncology."", ""Similar to our New York, New Jersey Women's Health and Clinical businesses, our national oncology testing segment will remain with BioReference Health under our GenPath Oncology brand, upon closing of the transaction with NACOR. We believe that BioReference Health is well positioned for further expense reductions and revenue expansion with a focus on the retained businesses in the New York and New Jersey markets after the divestiture. Complementing these efforts to boost performance, we will continue to improve our diagnostic division to further enhance profitability for OPKO Health and best position us as an innovative biopharmaceutical company. Moving to our pharmaceutical segment, as you've heard, NGENLA has been launched in all major global markets, like Pfizer."", ""We believe this drug is well positioned for significant growth as long-acting growth hormone products become the global standard in treating growth hormone deficiency for children. The launch is progressing as expected with an increasing and significant percentage of patients shifting from daily to the long-acting once a week NGENLA product. In addition, we expect our partnership with Pfizer to expand with additional indications including growth hormone deficiency for adults and other pediatric applications. And combined, these approvals for these two indications will entitle OPKO to an additional $100 million in milestone payments. Let me go to ModeX. As for ModeX, we're proud of the progress to date. In March, we announced favorable results from the Phase 1 clinical study with our trispecific antibody against HIV."", 'These clinical data are the first reported for a trispecific antibody in humans and strongly support further development of multispecific multivalent antibodies against HIV. The antibody was found to be safe and well tolerated at all dose levels through both intravenous and subcutaneous routes with minimal anti-drug antibodies observed with dosing ranging from 0.3 milligram per kilogram to 30 milligram per kilogram with up to four administrations and a pharmacokinetic which remained consistent and similar to standard molecular antibodies. We therefore believe and our partners at N.I.H. believe, that multispecific antibodies will offer a differentiated approach to long-lasting preventive and therapeutic options against most HIV-1 variants with the possibility of activating the immune system against the latent virus population to affect a functional cure.', ""We're a partner with N.I.H. on this program. Our collaboration with Merck to develop MDX2201 which is our Epstein-Barr virus multivalent nanoparticle vaccine is advancing on plan. We received a $50 million upfront payment upon licensing this vaccine with a potential $872.5 million in development and commercial milestones, plus royalties on global sales ranging from single-digit to double-digit percentages. In terms of timing, we expect this program to enter the clinic in the later part of this year. Our collaboration with BARDA is also proceeding on schedule and represents another source of non-dilutive funding for the company. We secured an initial $59 million grant to fund R&D and clinical evaluation through a Phase 1 study of our multispecific antibodies against known variants of SARS-CoV-2 for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19."", ""Additional funding of up to $109 million may be available from BARDA to develop multispecific antibodies and delivery approaches to target other biodefense threats such as influenza. The ultimate goal of this research program is to develop a platform with gene-based delivery methods using mRNA or DNA vectors to supplement the body's natural protein production processes which can then be used efficiently and effectively against future pandemics. Rounding out the ModeX pipeline is our immuno-oncology program which is focused on hard-to-treat solid tumors, as well as certain liquid tumors such as leukemia's and lymphomas. We believe our multispecific antibody candidates can simultaneously target several tumor antigens and enable better control of [indiscernible] immune system activation."", ""And we expect our Tetraspecific LASER program for solid tumors to enter the clinic this quarter as our first IND application, as indicated by Phil, focused on solid tumors was deemed acceptable to proceed by the FDA. Other immuno-oncology products are advancing through IND-enabling studies and are on target to enter clinical studies next year. So as you can see, it's an exciting time for OPKO, as we execute our strategy to gain profitability for BioReference Health by rightsizing the diagnostic division to its most profitable areas of activities, while advancing our biopharmaceutical segment with several programs set to enter the clinic this year. I will now turn the call over to Adam Logal to discuss our first quarter financial results. Adam?"", 'Adam Logal: Thank you, Elias. As Phil and Elias have discussed, we had a busy start to the year, realizing significant value from some of our underlying assets and strengthening our balance sheet. The convertible debt offering in January reduced our cash interest expense. This refinancing provided us the flexibility to align our cash needs for our research and development investments to debt maturities over the next five years. In addition, we used a portion of the proceeds to buy back 55 million shares of our common stock, reducing our outstanding shares by over 7%. We also announced our agreement with Labcorp for the sale of select assets, which was a competitive process. And when completed, that will allow us to realign our business operations to focus on core markets and test offerings and to support our path to profitability at BioReference.', 'While we are still within the review window with the Federal Trade Commission, we are diligently working on the profit plan for BioReference to ensure we get to break even and then profitability as quickly as possible. The Labcorp deal was the first large step in the multifaceted plan. Moving to our financial results for our diagnostic segment, we reported revenue for Q1, 2024 of $126.9 million compared with $132.4 million for the 2023 period. Cost and expenses decreased to $161.3 million for the first quarter of 2024 from $172.4 million for the 2023 period. Operating loss for our diagnostic segment of $34.4 million included approximately $2.2 million of nonrecurring costs related to employee severance and programs associated with our efforts to return to profitability.', 'Depreciation and amortization expense were $7.9 million and $8.7 million for the 2024 and 2023 periods, respectively. Revenues included approximately $27.8 million related to the book of business that is subject to our sale agreement with Labcorp. The cost and expenses related to this business were approximately $34.8 million. As part of the transaction, Labcorp has agreed to offer employment to more than 700 of our impacted employees who support this business. Moving to our pharmaceutical segment, revenue decreased to $46.8 million for the first quarter of 2024 from $105.2 million for the comparable period of 2023. Revenue from products including our intellectual property, our international pharmaceutical businesses decreased by $2.3 million, reflecting lower sales within our Israeli API business, partially offset by higher sales of Rayaldee.', 'Revenue from the transfer of IP was $8.7 million for the first quarter of 2024 compared to $64.8 million for the 2023 quarter, which included an upfront payment of $50 million from Merck as a result of our EBV vaccine agreement, as well as $9.5 million of milestone payments from our partners for Rayaldee. During the first quarter of 2024, Pfizer was able to substantially reduce the cost of manufacturing of NGENLA by obtaining approval for a significant scale-up of their manufacturing process, in order to support the global launch of NGENLA. In turn, Pfizer has revalued its inventory on-hand at December 31 and amortized that difference in manufacturing costs during the first four months of 2024, which is their standard accounting policy. As a result, our anticipated gross profit share for the first quarter was less than we anticipated, and we reported gross profit share from Pfizer of $5.8 million, which compares to $3.1 million for the 2023 period.', 'Pfizer has obtained significant payer access in the U.S. in 2024 for NGENLA and we look forward to the continued execution on their global commercialization plan. In addition, other revenue includes approximately $2.2 million from our underlying agreement with BARDA, which offsets R&D and underlying support expenses for that program. Costs and expenses for our pharmaceutical segment were $74.5 million for the first quarter of 2024, compared to $86.3 million for the 2023 period. Research and development expenses for the first quarter of 2024 were $21.2 million, compared to $31.9 million for the 2023 period. The 2023 quarter included the nonrecurring $12.5 million of expense related to our payment to Sanofi for their portion of our upfront payment from Merck.', ""Partially offsetting this decrease were increased activities for our ModeX development programs. The resulting operating loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 was $27.7 million, compared to operating income of $19 million for the first quarter of 2022-'23 which I previously mentioned benefited from the $57.5 million of milestone payments received in the quarter. Amortization expense related to intangible assets were unchanged at $16.4 million for both periods. Turning to our consolidated results, the first quarter of 2024 reported an operating loss of $71.5 million compared with an operating loss of $30.6 million for the 2023 quarter. Net loss for the 2024 period included approximately $26.2 million related to the fair value change on embedded derivatives related to our convertible notes issued in January."", ""For both periods, we recorded noncash unrealized gains on our investment in GeneDx of $22.7 and $16.8 million respectively, for the 2024 and 2023 periods. As a result, net loss for the first quarter of 2024 was $81.8 million for $0.12 per share and this compares with a net loss of 18.3 million or $0.02 per share for the 2023 quarter. Looking ahead, we're providing the financial guidance with the following assumptions. For our pharmaceutical segment there are a number of factors that will continue to impact our gross profit share payments from Pfizer, including revenue from product sales from Genotropin and NGENLA. Global sales of Genotropin for the first quarter of 2024 as reported by Pfizer, were $130 million and Pfizer has not separately reported sales of NGENLA However, we have continued to observe consistent prescription growth globally for NGENLA as reported by IQVIA and Symphony."", 'After adjusting for the expected accounting impact for the improved gross margins associated with the increased manufacturing scale of NGENLA, we have revised our estimated gross profit share to be between $30 million and $40 million versus our previous estimate of $40 million to $50 million. We also assume a stable foreign exchange rate for our ex-U.S. pharmaceutical businesses which will allow for continued profitable growth. R&D expenses for the second quarter of 2024 will reflect higher activities related to our ModeX programs including CMC and efforts related to the initiation of our first immuno-oncology clinical trial. A portion of these increased activities will continue to be funded through our BARDA agreement. For our diagnostic segment as the timing of our closing for our Labcorp transaction is not yet certain and is subject to FTC review, we have not adjusted our guidance to remove this business from our second quarter estimates.', ""As we've outlined, we're working to align the business to achieve cash flow break-even run rate by the middle of 2024 and profitability run rate by the end of the year which are both subject to the timing of closing of our Labcorp transaction. This work continues to include consolidating our geographic footprint and rationalizing our testing offerings as we expect our client mix to improve and our cost structure to appropriately support our go-forward strategy.

We had a strong start to the year with sales coming in at the high end of our expectations backed again by excellent operational performance. I want to begin today's call by thanking my colleagues for their continued focus on innovation and supporting our customers. These results reflect our drive to accelerate the benefits of pioneering science with our innovative portfolio. In the first quarter, market conditions were as expected, with cautious customer spending and later than typical budget releases. But as budgets opened up, we executed well with sales landing at the high end of our guide. We also continued to deliver outstanding operational results. Earnings were above our guidance and margins expanded even with volume and FX headwinds."", ""This is a testament to our team, our resilient business model and our operational initiatives. Waters is well positioned for future growth in our attractive secular end markets. In the first quarter, we added to our revitalized portfolio with new products that serve high-growth areas. Turning now to our results. In the first quarter, sales landed at the high end of our guidance, declining 7% as reported and 9% in organic constant currency. Our non-GAAP earnings per share exceeded our guidance at $2.21. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $1.72. Outside of China, sales declined mid-single digits as expected. In China, sales declined just under 30%, which was better than expected. Growth remained weak as our prior year baseline does not reflect last year's deterioration in market conditions, which became more pronounced in the second half."", 'While instruments declined 25% overall, LC sales were slightly better than expected, instrument weakness was led by mass spec, particularly for A&G-related applications, which had a tough prior year comparison from global funding and the China stimulus. Wyatt delivered a 3% M&A contribution to sales. We continue to see strong synergy performance and traction for our recently launched products such as ZetaStar. Now I will talk more about our operational performance. We believe the best reflection of good operational execution is effective margin management, particularly when things slow down. While facing significant headwinds from volume, FX and inflation, we delivered yet another strong margin result. Our gross margin expanded 40 basis points to 58.9%, and our operating margin expanded 20 basis points for the quarter to 27%.', 'This was achieved through a combination of our operational management initiatives across pricing, productivity and proactive cost alignment. These initiatives position us well for resilience during lower volume periods and give longer-term opportunity when market conditions normalize. You can see further evidence of our operational performance and our free cash flow. We had an exceptional start to the year, generating free cash flow of USD 234 million in the first quarter, which was 37% of sales. With our excellent free cash flow profile, we made rapid progress in delevering from the Wyatt acquisition, as we approach its 1-year anniversary. We serve attractive secular end markets where testing volume plays a pivotal role in our business. This volume, which is correlated with global prescription consumption is expected to accelerate in the future, supporting our strong long-term growth outlook.', 'Our distinct advantage in downstream applications lines with our full ecosystem of products that complement our innovative instrument portfolio. In addition, we have strategically aligned with high-growth opportunities that further enhance our core position. We had a busy quarter launching several new products that support a number of exciting, high-growth areas. At Analytica, last month, we launched the Alliance iS Bio, a version of our groundbreaking next-generation liquid chromatography platform suited for biologics applications. In the -- the new HPLC system combines advanced bioseparation technology, bioinert surfaces and built-in intelligence features. This helps Biopharma QC analysts boost efficiency and eliminate up to 40% of common lab errors.', ""We believe that the Alliance iS is the most significant innovation to hit pharma QA/QC labs in over a decade. We're excited to bring this technology to routine testing applications for biologics. Supporting BioSeparations, we launched a new set of size exclusion chromatography columns called GTxResolve Premier. These columns enable scientists to quickly assess aggregate content, integrity and purity of larger biologic particles. It covers modalities such as lipid nanoparticles, nucleic acids, and viral vectors and give scientists a significant improvement in sensitivity and sample consumption while accelerating run times. This launch supports the development of these modalities into downstream high-volume settings, where Waters has critical instrument technology like LC, mass spec and light scattering as well as highly innovative industry-leading software chemistry and service."", 'To simplify the detection of PFAS, we launched waters, Oasis, dual-phase analysis cartridges. This consumable streamline sample prep for PFAS workflows when detecting concentrations in water, soils, biosolids and tissues. It joins our comprehensive portfolio of solutions that support the surging demand for PFAS testing, which is a USD 300 million to USD 350 million global market, growing 20% annually. In an environment of increased scrutiny, the ability to accurately test for PFAS at very low levels is becoming a critical compliance need for a broad spectrum of industries. Our Xevo TQ absolute mass spec has leading sensitivity for detecting these anionic compounds. It can detect PFAS levels at as low as 1 part per quadrillion. Last month, in the United States, the EPA finalized and enforceable 4 parts per trillion limit of PFOA and PFOS in drinking water, which marks a significant regulatory milestone.', 'Later this year, further regulations governing PFAS are expected across the globe. This includes the European Union, where REACH proposed chemicals, regulation contemplates a PFAS ban on products manufactured as well as once imported. In our TA business, we launched the Rheo-IS, which serves battery testing applications when used with our hybrid rheometers. This Rheo-Impedance Spectroscopy accessory supports characterization of electrode studies, which can lead to more efficient battery production. I will now cover our 2024 full year guidance. With our first quarter results, we remain on track to achieve our full year revenue outlook, which is unchanged from our previous guidance at negative 0.5% to positive 1.5% growth in organic constant currency.', 'We expect growth rates to improve over the remainder of the year and as our prior year comparisons, especially in China get easier. We expect improving funnel activity to translate to orders as the year progresses. With our strong operational performance, we expect to build leverage in our P&L despite the flattish revenue guide and delivered 20 to 30 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion while still reinvesting for growth. As a result, our adjusted EPS guidance is also unchanged at 0% to 3% growth in the range of $11.75 to $12.05. Now I will pass the call over to Amol to continue covering our financial results in more detail and provide the rest of our guidance. Amol?', 'Amol Chaubal: Thank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, sales landed at the high end of our guidance range, declining 7% as reported and 9% in organic constant currency. As Udit mentioned, end market dynamics were consistent with our expectations. Ex-China declined mid-single digits as expected, while China declined close to 30%, which was slightly better than expected. In organic constant currency by end market, Pharma declined 6%, industrial declined 7% and academic and government declined 30%. In Pharma, sales outside of China declined low single digits as we executed well in this CapEx constrained environment. In China, sales declined almost 30% due to ongoing market challenges that are not reflected in our prior year baselines.', 'In industrial, food and environmental applications grew mid-single digits with continued strong growth in PFAS related workflows globally. We also saw strong growth in battery testing within our TA business, which has been a consistent growth theme. However, this strength was more than offset by weakness in core industrial applications, which are more cyclical. Our TA business declined high single digits overall, while chemical analysis declined high teens. In academic and government, growth was weak against a 45% comparison as stimulus in China and elevated global funding in the prior year quarter drove lumpy spending patterns. By geography, sales in Asia declined 16%. The Americas declined 8% and Europe declined 3%. By products and services, instruments declined 25% with LC growth slightly better than expected.', 'Within recurring revenues, chemistry grew low single digits and service grew mid-single digits, both of which were affected by low activity levels in China. The quarter had 1 fewer day versus first quarter of 2023, which translates to a growth headwind of approximately 1% for recurring revenues. Now I will comment on our first quarter non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Despite headwinds from lower sales volumes, FX and inflation, our team continued to respond to these challenges with resilience and commitment. Our focus on operational excellence with pricing, productivity and proactive cost alignment allowed us to deliver first quarter gross margin of 58.9%, an expansion of 40 basis points and first quarter adjusted operating margin of 27% and expansion of 20 basis points.', ""Our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 14.3% and our average share count was 59.4 million shares. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were $2.21. On a GAAP basis, earnings per fully diluted share were $1.72. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to this morning's press release and in the appendix of our earnings call presentation. Turning now to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures and excludes special items. In the first quarter of 2024, free cash flow was $234 million after funding $29 million of capital expenditures, which is approximately 37% of sales. We maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and well-structured debt maturity profile."", 'This strength allows us to prioritize investing in growth, including M&A and returning capital to shareholders. We continue to evaluate M&A opportunities that will meaningfully accelerate value creation. At the end of the quarter, our net debt position further declined to $1.7 billion, which is a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1.8x. This reflects a decrease of approximately $300 million, as we delivered the Wyatt acquisition. As previously disclosed, our share buyback program has been temporarily suspended to enable us to pay down debt incurred as part of the Wyatt acquisition last year. We will evaluate the resumption of our share repurchase program throughout 2024 as part of our balanced capital deployment objectives. Now I would like to share further commentary on our full year outlook and provide you with our second quarter guidance.', 'We expect to see an improvement in sales growth over the course of 2024 as prior year comparisons, particularly in China, become easier, and has improved funnel activity translates to orders. Our full year guidance is unchanged with 2024 organic constant currency sales growth expected between negative 0.5% and positive 1.5%. At current exchange rates, currency translation is expected to result in a negative impact of just under 1% on a full year sales basis. We expect Wyatt transaction to add just over 1% M&A contribution to our full year 2024 revenue for inorganic sales incurred in the first 4.5 months of the year. Therefore, our total reported sales growth guidance is unchanged at approximately 0% to 2%. Despite guiding to flattish sales, we expect to deliver a gross margin of 59.8% for the full year, which is a 20 basis points of expansion versus 2023.', 'We also expect to deliver 20 to 30 basis points of operating margin expansion versus 2023, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of slightly over 31%. We expect our full year net interest expense to be approximately $80 million. Our full year tax rate is expected to be 16.3%, and our average diluted 2024 share count is expected to be approximately 59.7 million. Rolling all this together, on a non-GAAP basis, our full year 2024 earnings per fully diluted share guidance is also unchanged and projected in the range of $11.75 to $12.05. This is approximately 0% to 3% growth and includes an estimated headwind of approximately 2% due to unfavorable foreign exchange. Looking to the second quarter 2024, we anticipate that cautious customer spending will persist.', 'In addition, while the China Q2 baseline reflects the onset of weakness, it does not fully reflect the weakness we observed in the second half of the year. As a result, we expect China to decline mid-teens in Q2 versus 28% decline we saw in Q1. Given these dynamics, we expect to see an improvement in year-over-year growth versus the first quarter and our second quarter organic constant currency sales growth guidance is projected in the range of negative 6% to negative 4%. At current rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 2%. Wyatt is expected to add approximately 1.5% M&A contribution for sales incurred in the first 1.5 month of the quarter. Therefore, our total second quarter reported sales growth guidance is negative 6.5% to negative 4.5%.', 'Based on these revenue expectations, second quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $2.50 to $2.60, which includes a negative currency impact of approximately 4 percentage points at current FX rates. Now I would like to turn the call back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit?', ""Udit Batra: Thank you, Amol. I would like now to give you a brief update on our progress towards leaving the world better than we found it, which is how we think about ESG. We work alongside wonderful people here at Waters, and I'm always proud when others recognize their talent and hard work. Our colleagues were recognized in the quarter for their achievements and contributions to separation science, excellence in manufacturing and for being champions of LGBTQ and women's benefits in the workplace. I would also like to congratulate Dr. Philip Wyatt, the founder of Wyatt Technology for receiving the esteemed Pittcon Heritage Award earlier this year. Dr. Wyatt's groundbreaking contributions to laser light scattering technology have paved the way for industry-leading advancements."", ""From a corporate standpoint, Waters has once again been honored by Barron's, earning a place on its list of the 100 most sustainable companies in 2024. Additionally, we are delighted to announce that S&P Global has included Waters in its 2024 sustainability yearbook. Separately, our commitment to robust governance practices was recently highlighted by the New England Chapter of the National Association of Corporate Directors. We were honored to have Massachusetts Governor, Maura Healey present Waters with the 2024 public company Board of the Year Award. After recently committing to SBTI, which is the science-based targets initiative, we are now building on the excellent progress we made in reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. We're in the process of setting new standards towards a long-term reduction in emissions and aligning our business with the 1.5 degree centigrade future."", ""Now to summarize, we're pleased with how the first quarter landed versus our expectations, which supports our full year guidance. We remain on track to achieving the 2024 objectives and look forward to building on this strength as the year progresses. Our long-term growth profile remains excellent, and we are aligned to secular tailwinds that are stronger than ever in our attractive markets. With our robust financial profile and balanced capital allocation strategy, we have an excellent platform to deliver sustained value for our shareholders. So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Caspar."", 'Caspar Tudor: Thanks, Udit. That concludes our formal comments.

236,7b1c9a9a-4ff5-335d-8a98-05dba72fab90,AES,2024-05-09,How Grid Enhancing Technologies Are Expanding Electric Power Transmission System Capabilities,POWER Magazine,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/7b1c9a9a-4ff5-335d-8a98-05dba72fab90/how-grid-enhancing.html,1715194756,STORY,['AES'],"['It’s no secret that power grids around the world need to expand to accommodate more renewable energy and the so-called “electrification of everything.” The latter, of course, refers to the growing trend of using electricity to power various sectors and applications that have traditionally relied on fossil fuels, such as natural gas or petroleum-based products. The electrification of everything includes the push toward electric vehicles; the transition from fossil fuel–based heating and cooling systems to electric alternatives, as well as the adoption of electric appliances; and the shift to more electric motors, furnaces, and other electric-powered equipment in manufacturing processes. Add to that the expected power needed to supply data centers and the growth of artificial intelligence-related computing, and current estimates of 50% load growth by 2050 could be vastly understated. Yet, getting new transmission lines planned, approved, and constructed is a daunting task, often taking a decade or longer to complete. So, how can the world more quickly add transmission capacity to the system without investing enormous time and money in the process? The answer: grid enhancing technologies, or GETs. “GETs are exciting to us because they are technologies that help us unlock quickly the additional headroom or additional capability of the grid to carry energy across the system,” Alexina Jackson, vice president of Strategic Development with AES Corp., said as a guest on The POWER Podcast. “This is something that is very important, because today, we are not making the fullest use of the electricity system as it’s built.” The system is operated below its maximum capacity for very good reasons, specifically, to maintain reliability, but by implementing GETs, it can be operated closer to its true limits without risk of failure. “Once we have these technologies, such as dynamic line rating, which helps us visualize the dynamic and full headroom of the electrical grid, and then technologies like storage as transmission, advanced power flow control, topology optimization—they all allow us to operate the grid in its dynamic capability. By doing both these things—visualization and operation dynamically—we’re able to start making fuller use of that carrying capacity for energy, which will allow us to add additional energy more quickly, serve our customer needs more efficiently, and ultimately decarbonize faster,” Jackson said.', 'AES published a white paper in April titled “Smarter use of the dynamic grid: Accessing transmission headroom through GETs deployment.” The 20-page document goes into much greater detail on the four items Jackson mentioned—dynamic line rating (DLR), storage as transmission (SAT), advanced power flow control (APFC), and topology optimization. DLR. The paper explains: “Traditionally, TOs [transmission owners] use static or seasonal line ratings based on worst-case assumptions—for example, the hottest time and day of the season under low wind speeds. This often results in conservative ratings that do not accurately reflect the true thermal capacity of a line at a given point in time. In contrast, DLR provides real-time visibility into line capacity and customized rating profiles on lines that are otherwise identical.” DLR can be particularly beneficial in high wind areas because wind can cool conductors and enable them to carry more current. Similarly, lines can carry more current in lower temperatures, so utilities with transmission constraints during winter peaks could benefit greatly from DLR. And deploying DLR technology can be done relatively quickly. AES partnered with LineVision on a project that went very smoothly. “We were able to deploy in a series of months from the idea of wanting to deploy dynamic line rating to actually getting it on the grid,” Jackson said. “That’s a really quick turnaround—doing anything on the grid in less than a year is really significant when it comes to transmission.” SAT. Again, the white paper explains: “In operations, Storage as Transmission (SAT) can absorb excess generation during periods of low load and store it near load to dispatch during peak periods when transmission lines risk congestion. Using storage in this way reduces system costs from congestion pricing and can reduce harmful pollutants and overall carbon emissions by avoiding use of peaking thermal power plants.” “Storage as transmission is just another evolution in storage’s capabilities,” said Jackson. “I like to say that it would be great to let storage bring its full self to work, because it has a lot of talents that we’re currently under-using.” Jackson suggested that many people see storage as either an energy asset or a transmission asset, but the truth is it can do both from the same device. “One way to think about that might be as an effective warehousing and logistics solution, or you might also think about it as an Airbnb for the grid, where you can make sure that the resources that we have in the system are being used effectively,” she said. APFC. Advanced power flow control (APFC) controls the magnitude of power flows along specific transmission paths, and can mitigate thermal and stability issues that arise by changing the flow to alternative paths, the white paper says. Without getting too technical, Jackson explained that APFC alters the impedance on lines to encourage flow via a desired route. “If you imagine energy, like water, will flow where there’s less resistance to it flowing,” she said. “And so, you can actually change the impedance to say, ‘Flow on this less-constrained line. Don’t flow on this more-constrained line.’ And so, it allows you to ‘push’ or ‘pull’ energy in certain directions through its physical properties, so that it goes in the direction that you prefer to see it go.” Topology Optimization. The AES white paper explains: “Topology optimization refers to the strategic reconfiguration of the power grid’s structure by switching the status of circuit breakers, switches, or other controllable devices. This process involves switching transmission lines in or out and/or splitting bus sections. For example, if load is growing rapidly and stressing one feeder, grid operators can transfer all or part of the load to adjacent feeders through switching actions at substations and minimize the risk of equipment failure and outages. Studied topology optimization solutions can be applied quickly to mitigate unexpected events like equipment failures or demand changes.” Although the actual process is more complicated than this, Jackson said a person could imagine turning on or off a light switch, so that you can allow energy to flow or not flow across the line. “If we’re seeing constraints on a line, or we’re seeing certain potential for overloading other lines, we can make decisions to actually change the flow of energy across lines to make better use of them,” she explained.', 'The solutions Jackson talked about are not pie-in-the-sky ideas, they are tools being demonstrated and used commercially today. Yet, a lot of people are still not aware of the possibilities. That’s why AES published the white paper: to help spread the word. “One key thing we need to do is education,” said Jackson. “We’re sharing our insights at a system level. We want to make sure that we’re breaking down barriers to people’s understanding of these technologies.” Yet, to make a real difference, deployment of these tools is necessary at scale. “Deployments are going to help people understand, not only conceptually, but actually in the field, how these technologies can be done, how they perform, things to watch out for, things to make the most of, so that we can move from those early deployments into scale,” Jackson said.

During this period, the Zacks Transportation - Airline industry, which United falls in, has gained 5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?"", ""While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making."", 'Earnings Estimate Revisions', ""Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements."", 'For the current quarter, United is expected to post earnings of $4.02 per share, indicating a change of -20.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2.4% over the last 30 days.', 'For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.93 points to a change of -1.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +2.2%.', 'For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.42 indicates a change of +15% from what United is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1%.', ""Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, United is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)."", ""The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:"", '12 Month EPS', 'Projected Revenue Growth', ""While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth."", 'In the case of United, the consensus sales estimate of $15.32 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +8%.

The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.', 'Valuation', ""No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation.

Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Meaning, you will need to purchase Target's shares before the 14th of May to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 10th of June."", ""The company's upcoming dividend is US$1.10 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$4.40 per share to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Target has a trailing yield of 2.8% on the current share price of US$159.59. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing."", ' View our latest analysis for Target ', ""Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Target paid out a comfortable 49% of its profit last year. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Dividends consumed 53% of the company's free cash flow last year, which is within a normal range for most dividend-paying organisations."", ""It's positive to see that Target's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. Fortunately for readers, Target's earnings per share have been growing at 10% a year for the past five years. Target is paying out a bit over half its earnings, which suggests the company is striking a balance between reinvesting in growth, and paying dividends. Given the quick rate of earnings per share growth and current level of payout, there may be a chance of further dividend increases in the future."", ""The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, Target has lifted its dividend by approximately 9.8% a year on average. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders."", ""Should investors buy Target for the upcoming dividend? From a dividend perspective, we're encouraged to see that earnings per share have been growing, the company is paying out less than half of its earnings, and a bit over half its free cash flow. Target looks solid on this analysis overall, and we'd definitely consider investigating it more closely."", ""In light of that, while Target has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock.

With weaker-than-expected job growth per the April nonfarm payrolls report and moderating wage gains, investors are pricing in a second rate cut by the end of the year with a nearly 50% likelihood of a 25-basis point rate cut in September.Recent data from the nonfarm payrolls report showed job additions of 175,000 in April, well below the broader expectations of 240,000, with wage figures also coming in less than expected. This allayed investor fears that the economy was “overheating” or “reaccelerating” and propelled the stocks. In addition, the Middle East ceasefire with Hamas accepting an Egyptian-Qatari proposal to end the war with Israel boosted the stocks. The equity markets were also aided by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's comments, which largely ruled out a central bank hike in its next policy meeting after holding the rates steady between 5.25% and 5.50% in May.\xa0 \xa0Amid the uncertainty, investors often seek to employ time-tested winning strategies to fetch sustained profits. One of the most successful game plans to beat the blues is to bet on momentum stocks when value or growth investing fails to generate the desired profits.This approach primarily tends to follow the adage, “the trend is your friend.” At its core, momentum investing is “buying high and selling higher.” It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend, it is more likely to continue in that direction because of the momentum that is already behind it. But before we delve deep into it, let us try to fathom why does the momentum strategy at all work?There are several behavioral biases that most investors exhibit in their decision-making. And these emotional responses, or rather mistakes, make the momentum strategy work.For example, some investors are anxious about booking losses and hence hold on to losing stocks for too long, hopeful of a rebound in prices. On the other hand, a few investors sell their winners way too early. Momentum investing is one of the best strategies to avoid making such errors in judgment.Furthermore, investors initially tend to underreact to news, events or data releases. However, once things become clear, they have a habit of going with the flow and overreacting, causing dramatic price reactions. These behavioral problems extend trends, thus opening up huge opportunities for momentum players.To sum up, momentum investing is a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future. It is based on that gap in time before the mean reversion occurs, i.e., before prices become rational again.In this context, stocks like Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL, Super Micro Computer, Inc. SMCI and Leidos Holdings, Inc. LDOS are worth betting on.Momentum strategies have been known to be alpha-generative over a long period and across market stages. So, this strategy is quite tricky to implement, as detecting these trends is no child’s play.Here, we have created a strategy to help investors get in on these fast movers and rake in handsome gains. Our screen will help you benefit from both long-term price momentum and a short-term pullback in price."", ""Percentage Change in Price (52 Weeks) = Top #50: This selects the top 50 stocks with the best percentage price change over the last 52 weeks. This parameter ensures we get the best stocks that have appreciated steadily over the past year.Percentage Change in Price (1 Week) = Bottom #10: From the above 50 stocks, we then choose those that are also among the 10 worst performers over a short one-week period. This parameter picks the ones that have witnessed a short-term pullback in price.Zacks Rank #1: Stocks sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) have a proven history of outperformance irrespective of the market conditions.

It indicates when the timing is best to grab a stock and take advantage of its momentum with the highest probability of success. Stocks with a Momentum Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy), handily outperform other stocks.Current Price greater than $5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5.Market Capitalization = Top #3000: We have chosen stocks that are among the top 3000 in terms of market value to ensure the stability of price.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that these stocks are easily tradable.Here are three stocks out of the six that made it through this screen:Based in Miami, Royal Caribbean is a cruise company operating three global brands — Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Azamara Club Cruises.

But it wasn't always a given that Neblett would go into the family business. His father Rives Neblett was a successful attorney and wasn't hands-on in his farming operation the way many farm owners may be. The younger Neblett knew he was free to explore the world and discover his own passion and way once he graduated from high school, but that the farm would always be there."", '""We\'re a little different in that my dad was a farmer, landowner, a lawyer, a real estate guy, commodity trader and he didn\'t have his hands directly in the pie on the farm,"" said Thomas Neblett. ""He let me know you don\'t have to drive a tractor and be out on that farm if that\'s not what you want to do. And he let it be known early on that he didn\'t want me to feel like I had to farm or that that was what he wanted me to do.""', 'When Thomas Neblett graduated from high school, he took the path that many Americans follow, and he headed off to college. While a freshman at the University of Mississippi, Thomas went into kidney failure and needed an emergency transplant. That confirmed his growing belief that college was not the path to his future.', 'I knew then that farming was what I wanted to do - I can tell you for a fact - but this land we own and what my family has been doing for four generations, I think is literally in my blood.Thomas Neblett', 'Farming in His Blood', '""School was not for me and by the time I got to college, I was over it,"" noted Thomas Neblett. ""I knew then that farming was what I wanted to do - I can tell you for a fact - but this land we own and what my family has been doing for four generations, I think is literally in my blood.""', ""His father, Rives, would agree. His own grandfather, also a lawyer, launched the farming family dynasty in the late 1920s when he began acquiring farmland while practicing law. And on Thomas' mother's side of the family, the farming gene reaches back to his grandfather Charlie Lowrance who was a successful farmer and ginner in Arkansas."", '""Thomas has grown up in the operation, worked on the farm in the summers and over the holidays and was active in learning the ropes through my farm managers,"" shared Rives Neblett, owner of Allendale Planting Company in Shelby, Mississippi, one of the premier farming operations in the Delta. ""I had hoped Thomas would finish college, but when he came home at 19 and said he wanted to go into farming, I knew his mind was made up.""', 'Rives Neblett shared his own farming family history and some of the best advice he had ever received from his own father.', '""He told me, you can\'t come back and farm for five years until you have proven yourself in another profession working for someone else,"" said Rives. ""It was the best advice that anyone ever gave me because it would have been tempting to return and start farming for my father right after college. Knowing that I couldn\'t, I went to law school, got a degree and went to work for IRS for a few years, then for a firm in Mississippi. I took a similar approach with Thomas when he decided to go into farming.""', ""Failure Wasn't an Option"", 'Rather than having Thomas work for him on the family farm, Rives Neblett turned to his longtime Regions Agriculture Banking Leader Alan Sims.', '""I took Thomas to the bank and asked to borrow enough money to farm about 2,400 acres - a stretch for me, Thomas, Alan and the bank given Thomas was only 20 years old - but I had developed a relationship with Regions, and if I was putting Thomas in that position, I\'d make sure he was succeeding,"" shared Rives.', 'Sims concurred.', '""Even with the existing relationship, a bank doesn\'t make a loan to someone simply because they can pay it back, the business plan had to make sense - and it did,"" said Sims.', 'It seemed there was nothing to worry about from the very beginning, Thomas Neblett confirmed.', '""I was confident enough in myself - I wouldn\'t allow myself to do it if I didn\'t think I could make it,"" Thomas said. ""I love what I do. I didn\'t realize you could have a passion about something and not consider it work. The work is there - and it can be tiring and frustrating, but there is never a day I wake up and don\'t want to go and do it.""', ""When I got started, we knew we were working with Regions. There are a lot of turnovers in banking, but Regions hasn't changed.Thomas Neblett"", 'All About the Relationship', '""My dad has been a long-time Regions customer and has a great relationship with the bank,"" said Thomas. ""When I got started, we knew we were working with Regions. There are a lot of turnovers in banking, but Regions hasn\'t changed. Alan has been able to keep a close eye on our business.""', 'Sims agreed.', '""I remember that meeting: Rives, long-tenured relationship, asking for that start-up loan with Thomas. We sat down and Rives had a well-prepared loan request we reviewed and tweaked, and we were able to make the loan,"" said Sims. ""The rest is history.""', ""Sims noted on that day, Rives pulled him aside and said, I can teach him farming, but I'd like you to teach him the rest."", '""Thomas has a work ethic like no other and has done really well,"" said Sims. ""He\'s made tremendous yields on his farm and has been very successful since starting his farming operation a decade ago.""', 'Sustainability is Key', '""From the very beginning in the 1970s, we stressed land forming in our operation and irrigation,"" shared Rives Neblett. ""We were some of the first people to start an actual program of land forming - engineering/forming the land so you can thoroughly irrigate it.""', 'He explained that in the Delta, that was the way to go given the climate. They had to have the ability to irrigate. Allendale Planting Company started that program and as they developed the land forming of the land, they worked with the soil conservation services putting highly erodible land next to streams into a Conservation Reserve Program for conservation and recreational purposes.', 'Thomas Neblett has continued and expanded the processes to ensure sustainability and soil health.', '""One of the biggest things I have learned since I started this business is how important drainage is - getting the water off my fields quickly and efficiently so I can grow my crops,"" Thomas Neblett noted. ""My dad and his farm managers have been pioneers in developing land and putting in pipes, digging new ditches and keeping that land from eroding.""', 'My dad has told me my whole life, in order to stay where you are in the world, you have to work harder than everyone else - if you do that, it will pay off.Thomas Neblett', 'Trusting Your Instincts', 'Thomas Neblett credits some of his success with his ability to assess the appropriate risks that have the potential to yield strong rewards.', '""One major thing I\'ve learned is that what you read and what people can tell you doesn\'t mean anything. It is what you can do and what you believe yourself that matters,"" said Thomas. ""I\'ve picked up land that people have said was worthless and turned it profitable. More often than not, I\'ve made it work. I\'ve made mistakes, but the good decision have outweighed the missteps.""', 'And he credits his dad with instilling in him the strong work ethic that has driven his success.', '""My dad has told me my whole life, in order to stay where you are in the world, you have to work harder than everyone else - if you do that, it will pay off.""', 'Thomas and his wife Beth are instilling this same work ethic in their three girls, ages 4 through 12, who represent a sixth generation of this farming family.', 'Experiences and opinions stated by customers are their own.

(NYSE:V) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more."", 'While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Visa ', ""The insider, Alfred Kelly, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.5m worth of shares at a price of US$236 each. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$276, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. It is worth noting that this sale was only 9.7% of Alfred Kelly's holding."", ""Insiders in Visa didn't buy any shares in the last year.

In total, Independent Director Lloyd Carney sold US$250k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain."", ""For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Visa insiders own 0.05% of the company, worth about US$261m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders."", ""An insider sold Visa shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. But it is good to see that Visa is growing earnings.

Both offer impressive yields standing at over 6%. Contrast this to the S&P 500's long-term dividend yield of 1.8%."", ""These two companies also generate reliable revenue, since mobile phone and internet services are essential in today's connected world. This makes their dividends resilient. For instance, both maintained quarterly payments during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic when other firms were forced to eliminate dividends."", ""Although AT&T and Verizon both possess appealing traits, one of them edges out its competitor as a superior stock to buy. But determining which one is not necessarily straightforward. Here's a look at each, and why one makes a better investment for the long haul."", ""AT&T has consistently proven capable of capturing customers since CEO John Stankey took over the top spot in 2020. Since then, the company has achieved 15 straight quarters of net additions in its postpaid phone subscribers, the telecom industry's most valuable customer segment."", ""AT&T is also steadily expanding its fiber optic internet service. Under Mr. Stankey's tenure, the firm increased its fiber broadband connections from 4.7 million in 2020 to 8.6 million through the end of this year's first quarter."", ""Despite the customer growth, AT&T's Q1 revenue of $30 billion was down from the prior year's $30.1 billion. Lower equipment sales contributed to the decline, dropping from $5.1 billion in the first quarter of 2023 to $4.6 billion this year."", ""Equipment revenue can vary based on many factors -- for example, when Apple launches a new iPhone. That's why a good indicator of AT&T's business growth is to look at its wireless service revenue. Here, the company saw a 3.3% year-over-year increase to $16 billion."", ""AT&T also generated free cash flow (FCF) of $3.1 billion in Q1, up by 2.1 billion over the previous year. FCF is key to the company's ability to perform actions such as invest in its business and fund its dividend."", 'Verizon kicked off 2024 with Q1 wireless service sales rising 3.3% year over year to $19.5 billion. The growth was helped by a price increase the company implemented in 2023. This enabled Verizon to reach $33 billion in total Q1 revenue, 10% more than AT&T.', ""Verizon also generated Q1 FCF of $2.7 billion, up from the prior year's $2.3 billion. Its ability to produce consistently strong FCF allowed the company to raise its dividend for the 17th consecutive year last fall. This is the longest streak in the U.S. telecom industry, according to Verizon."", ""The firm is also finding success expanding its broadband business. Internet customers rose by 18% over the past year to reach more than 11 million subscribers in Q1. But unlike AT&T's streak of postpaid phone net additions, Verizon suffered a Q1 net loss of 68,000 in this area. However, this is a fairly typical seasonal pattern for the telecom behemoth."", ""The company usually sees a surge of new postpaid customers in Q4 thanks to holiday promotions, only to lose some subscribers in Q1. Accounting for this seasonal pattern, Verizon's Q1 postpaid phone net loss marks its strongest first-quarter performance in its consumer division since 2018."", 'Deciding between AT&T and Verizon can be challenging because each possesses different strengths and weaknesses. AT&T is able to consistently grow its key customer base, but Verizon generates more revenue, and offers a longer streak of dividend increases.', 'AT&T, on the other hand, cut its dividend by nearly 50% in 2022 after divesting entertainment assets. Since then, the company has not raised its dividend.', ""Another consideration is valuation. AT&T possesses a lower price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio) of 9, versus 14.5 for Verizon. This indicates AT&T's stock is attractively priced compared to its rival."", 'In addition, the consensus among Wall Street analysts is an overweight rating for AT&T stock, with a median share price target of $20. Verizon also received an overweight rating, with a median share price target of $45.50, suggesting both stocks have some upside.', ""But one factor tips the scale in Verizon's favor as the better telecom stock. AT&T and Verizon are primarily income investments. They're not considered growth stocks. In this context, Verizon is the better investment choice. The company's long history of dividend increases, coupled with dependable FCF, makes Verizon superior to AT&T as a source for passive income."", 'Before you buy stock in Verizon Communications, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Verizon Communications wasn’t one of them.

280,0cd8e3d6-2fc9-391f-8328-1be5db629855,VZ,2024-05-09,How NFL’s Troy Vincent balances the game’s thrill and safety,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/nfl-troy-vincent-balances-game-095502171.html,1715248502,VIDEO,['VZ'],"[""The National Football League needs no introduction. Thanks to high-stake media deals and a big push into building a global fanbase, the NFL has built the world’s largest sports league — valued at $163 billion across its 32 teams, according to Forbes. Its lead in the industry is no accident. It’s the result of careful business branding, exclusive sponsorships, expanding the interests of an already massive audience, and adjusting to the changing landscape of the sport. In the 2023-24 season alone, the NFL partnered with 48 brands, holding top deals with EA Sports (EA), Nike (NKE) and Verizon (VZ), while generating over $11 billion from broadcasters, including Peacock, Amazon (AMZN), and ESPN, according to GlobalData. The 2024 Super Bowl also became the most-watched television program in US history. However, the NFL wouldn't exist, much less be the powerhouse it is today, without the league’s nearly 1,700 players. Troy Vincent is the one who is looking out for them on the field. As Executive Vice President of Football Operations, Vincent heads player development and oversees new and, at times, risky rules to a game loved and watched by millions, with one goal in mind — building on the success of the NFL through investing in its players.Before joining the C-suite, Vincent got his start in the NFL with the Miami Dolphins as a rookie cornerback in 1992. But NFL fans know him best from his time playing for the Philadelphia Eagles, where \u200b\u200bhe made five consecutive Pro Bowls."", 'Yahoo Finance’s Josh Lipton visits the NFL headquarters and is later invited to Vincent’s family home in Purcellville, Virginia to get a closer look at the forces driving Vincent’s leadership and the business behind ‘America’s sport.’', 'For more on our Lead This Way Series, click here, and tune in to Yahoo Finance every Thursday.', ""JOSH LIPTON: The NFL needs no introduction… and neither does Troy Vincent, former Philadelphia Eagles cornerback turned NFL insider. As Executive Vice President of Football Operations in a league of 32 teams - valued at 163 billion dollars - Vincent oversees what's most critical to the game - its rules."", 'TROY VINCENT: Leadership is lonely. Your compromises of today become your standards of tomorrow.', ""JOSH LIPTON: Behind the business of America's sport, football operations is tasked with monitoring policies on the field to protect players without damaging the popularity of the game. And Vincent is doing it at a time when the NFL’s coaching and player development are being questioned, even by former quarterback legend, Tom Brady. With the NFL’s commercial success and growing fanbase, there’s a reason why it’s often hailed as one of the country’s greatest unifiers. But there is no NFL without its nearly 1,700 players and Vincent…committed to the athletes and preserving the integrity of the game. Yahoo Finance met with Vincent at the NFL headquarters - in New York City - to get a closer look at the challenges and rewards of heading the operations of the world’s largest sports league."", 'TROY VINCENT: So Josh, this is where - the Art McNally GameDay Central - is where I probably spend during the season, 98 percent of my time.', 'JOSH LIPTON: So this is when I hear Aikman, Joe Buck say…', 'TROY VINCENT: Anytime you hear an announcer, this play is going back to New York, or is being reviewed in New York.', 'JOSH LIPTON: Right in here.', 'TROY VINCENT: This is where we’re talking about.', ""JOSH LIPTON: Let’s go…one thing’s for sure… Vincent is not soft about football, even when running new and, at times, risky policies to a game loved and watched by millions - with one goal in mind - building on the success of the league by investing in its players. You want policies and procedures on the field that are going to protect players, reduce risk. You also, though, want to maintain the spirit of the game that Americans love, which is, listen, it's the pace, it's the energy, it's the aggression, right? How do you kind of think about balancing those goals?"", ""TROY VINCENT: So, I'm in a unique position from my former years as being on the field, as being a, being a participant, playing the game, playing at a high level. And now my current role as a gatekeeper, I'm one of many gatekeepers, but the individual under Commissioner Goodell's leadership to be responsible for Josh. I would say it's the balance of, it's the right integration. It's protecting, preserving the game that Americans and those abroad have come to love. They love points, they love the excitement, they love them. They love these memorable moments while being responsible of protecting players from unnecessary risk. And we have a comprehensive approach to that. I appreciate it's a different game today. I'll start with, it's a different game today. It's a better game for, I think it's a better game today. And it's a much safer game today. Why? The players are more athletic than they've ever, than than we've ever seen. They're bigger, they're faster, they're stronger, they're stronger. The pace is much more fluid, efficient. Great coaching. The players are so athletic, they're skill level was so high. But I come from an era where there were things that we did that I did, personally, things I was taught that really had no place in the game."", 'JOSH LIPTON: An example?', 'TROY VINCENT: Like just using the helmet as a weapon, like trying to really inflict harm to your opponent. That was the mentality.', 'JOSH LIPTON: Before joining the executive team, Vincent got his start in the NFL as a first round pick in the 1992 draft to play with the Miami Dolphins. As a cornerback, he helped the Dolphins reach the AFC Championship game his rookie year, but Vincent really made his mark when he signed with the Philadelphia Eagles, where he made five consecutive Pro Bowls. But, as Vincent says, football was a different game in his time.', ""TROY VINCENT: There was an era of football that we grew to love, self included, that was just, there was a brutality that was just like, it was acceptable. Now, with science and engineering and research we've seen, it's really about what does life look like? Because a 21 to 22-year-old has no clue of what life looks like or will feel like at the age of 40, 50, or 60. That's our responsibility as legends, as gatekeepers to protect that player from unnecessary risk."", ""JOSH LIPTON: As Vincent puts it, encouraging player safety while at the same time maintaining the pace and aggression of the game fans love is a careful balancing act. In 2024, the hip-drop tackle was banned after the NFL found injury rates were 25 times higher when a tackler wraps a runner, unweights himself, and traps his opponent's legs. Rule changes have left some fans and players concerned the game has been watered down and is not as exciting as it used to be. According to Sportsbook Review, 82 percent of fans believe rules and penalties should be changed."", ""TOM BRADY: “I think there's a lot of mediocrity in today's NFL.”"", 'JOSH LIPTON: In 2023, former quarterback Tom Brady didn’t hold back on voicing his concerns with the direction of the league.', 'TOM BRADY: “The rules have allowed a lot of bad habits to get into the actual performance of the game.”', ""TROY VINCENT: I respect Tom and Tom has earned that right to voice his opinion, like others. And they should - challenge, hold us accountable as gatekeepers. In Tom's era, the quarterback, you didn't have the majority of the quarterbacks weren't dual threats, pocket passers. We've seen not a handful, you know, when, but when you look at the way the rosters, from your Josh Allens to your Patrick Mahomes, your Lamar Jackson’s, your Russell Wilson’s, these threat quarterbacks, your Justin Fields, these individuals - it's a different era in quarterback play."", 'JOSH LIPTON: In the offseason, Vincent and the NFL Competition Committee assess what changes need to be made for the next season. And on March 26th, NFL owners approved a new rule that is turning what was called a “dead play” into an integral part of the game again… kickoffs. As opposed to a traditional running start, the kicker will kick off from his 35-yard line and the rest of the kicking team will line up at their opponent’s 40-yard line. The play begins when the ball is either caught or hits the ground in the landing zone. The goal? Create an exciting play with higher returns while also reducing injuries.', ""TROY VINCENT: It's the space and speed. It's when the player has the ability, and our players are now - they're running 18 to 22 miles an hour when they have that space to build up that kind of speed. And then you make the impact, man, that's not what we want. We all know as fans, when you have an explosive kickoff play, it changes the atmosphere. Not only in the stadium, it changes the momentum of the game. We want to bring those elements back. They should be back."", ""JOSH LIPTON: The new kickoff model will give return opportunities to players with big-play potential. And the impact was immediate with the Pittsburgh Steelers signing a two-year, six million dollar contract for Cordarrelle Patterson, who had a record nine kickoff return touchdowns during the 2023 season.The new rule even influenced draft-day decisions, the lifeline for keeping the league fresh and competitive, with Texas A&M’s Ainias smith, Penn State’s Daequan Hardy, and University of Texas’s Xavier Worthy - selected for their speed and return capability. On top of athletic performance, player development and coaching are critical in determining whether a rookie will thrive. And Vincent's work with players isn't just about what happens on the field - helping them plan for life after football is just as important."", ""TROY VINCENT: I was always concerned about the challenges of transition. And players, you know, you go from college and now you spend the next few years - I had the opportunity to play at 15 - a sport that we love - kid’s game, man's body. And you don't have the time to develop some of those skills that you would get in an internship or that you would get in a normal nine to five job. So creating programs or initiatives to allow the player to at least learn some skills around transition or things that he may have interest in. So from our business entrepreneurship programs, broadcast boot camp, and now we're at a different era, like the game has evolved. Players are now being paid in high school. At the collegiate level, the accessibility to information is at their fingertips. Many more entrepreneurs, players wanting to own their own media company. So we've had to adjust what the players' interests are based off of where they are. Some of them are coming into the league as rookies, financially stable. Financial literacy being taught at the high school collegiate level is different. So that is something that's dear to my heart personally, is making sure that - working with the players association, working with the clubs that we're all in alignment with player transition. It’s going to happen. The inevitable is going to happen. And oftentimes that transition happens not by your choice. And are you ready? And do you have the skills to transition into what we say, ‘the new normal’?"", ""JOSH LIPTON: Football is even bigger than the game itself. The NFL adds 5 billion dollars to the US economy every year. And the 2024 super bowl became the most watched television program in US history. Its dominance is no accident. It's the result of strategic media deals and exclusive sponsorships. Last season alone, the NFL was partnered with 48 brands, holding top deals with EA sports, Nike and Verizon, while generating over 11 billion dollars from broadcasters, including Peacock, Amazon, and ESPN. It’s more than just a pastime - it’s become a cultural phenomenon bringing together millions of fans - even when the country feels most divided. As Executive Vice President, Vincent says it’s a tremendous responsibility to support the league’s powerhouse operations, but also a shared one."", ""TROY VINCENT: We're working together to try to come together to win a football game and, and create some excitement. I hope your lips to God's ears, that the game can continue to be a positive force for just people coming together, cheering for their club, cheering for their favorite players at the same time. It's a delicate balance, a delicate integration of things that we believe that are important for the player, important for the club that we come together to try to resolve those things together. It's not always perfect and there is disruption that occurs, but we understand the platform that the National Football League has on the broader society."", 'JOSH LIPTON: A platform that goes well beyond revenue and profits and taps into the inspiration and drive that not only got Vincent into the league, but got him to where he is today.', ""TROY VINCENT: I believe everything that I've learned in my current role are attributes and things that I learned in athletics. What you did on Sundays, Mondays, and Thursdays, and how you showed up on game day was a reflection of what you did during the week. If you didn't practice, if you didn't detail your work, if you lacked in on preparation with video review, game preparation, it showed up on Sunday. It showed up on Monday night and Thursday night. So paying attention to detail, falling in love with the basics every single day - following this process, prepares you to have success when the lights are on. But going from the playing field to the boardroom, those same skills were natural transitions in the corporate area. Being a good listener. Being a good communicator, not trying to be the loudest voice or the most talkative voice in the room. Being a collaborator, being a partner, showing up every day. Where I began, I didn't know what a leader was. My own personal experience of - how do you influence, how do you show up the same all the time? How do you get an individual or a team of folks to believe in what you're saying? Kind of galvanize all towards one common goal? Initially - performance in the world of sport. When you performed, oftentimes that kind of evolved you to a leadership level by producing on the field. But then as I matured, there was a parallel of on-field performance with literally what the impact you were making on decisions that were not on the field, whether they were in the community or inside the locker room, being a locker room leader around areas of the collective bargaining agreement, hours, wages, working conditions, and player rights, family rights. Now being mature in my current role, 15 years here now at the National Football League, it's really about people and getting people to believe in what your objectives are, what your goals are, and why is important for them to at least hear what you're saying and buy into moving in that same direction.""]"

We had a strong start with Q1 results above the high end of our guidance range across all metrics. X-tack of $139 million grew 20% versus last year. Adjusted EBITDA of $23 million grew more than 100% free cash flow was nearly $27 million in Q1 and also more than doubled last year. All metrics beat the high end of our guidance range and are on track to meet our full year 2024 guidance. I'm also encouraged to see that our growth rates are accelerating compared to last year. Looking at our use of cash over 100% of free cash flow in Q1 was spent on share buybacks, demonstrating our strong commitment to shareholder returns and confidence in our long-term strategy and ability to execute with a strong Q1 and Q2 guidance showing double digit growth versus the same time last year. We are reiterating our 2024 guidance, which projects accelerated growth on every metric and making 2024 for a record year for us. Revenue growing 33% to nearly $2 billion, X-Tack growing 25% to almost $670 million. Adjusted EBITDA of over $200 million, growing approximately 2x 2023 and over $100 million of free cash flow, which is also two times 2023 levels. When looking at our core business. Our main focus is, first, making our advertisers successful and in return growing our yield year over year and a second and a big focus for us this year is ramping young, starting with our initiatives driving advertiser success. I can tell you just come back from an upside where a lot of what we talked about is our goal to expand our initiatives to make to build a company recognized for quality across all fronts, delivering premium experiences to users and publishers while attracting Tier one performance advertisers. As I wrote in my shareholder letter. I am happy to report that we've just crossed the 20% mark of our revenue being driven by top brands and agencies, and it's growing fast. We think there's a big upside here in many ways, more than have imagined in the past. You will hear me speak a lot about it this year and onwards. As I think this can be material to our partners as well as for us driving yields even faster. Let me share a bit more about this. We have recently launched select as a way for premium performance advertisers to reach our top 15% of publishers, which includes Yahoo Apple, NBC, Disney and more with a premium standalone ad experience. Big brands are willing to pay a premium for it were focused exclusively on performance. This is not a branding play. We're not looking for top of the funnel budget here, but to enable big performance budgets to go beyond social and search to the open web and Taboola as new offerings between TiVo select our Yahoo partnership, our Apple partnership and the success of Tier one advertisers such as Hulu, Citi Verizon. We hope to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace and help drive yields even faster. Our biggest R&D and product investment is making advertisers successful. I'm happy to share that Maximus conversions adoption continues to grow and is now almost 60% of our revenue. We're focused on improving our retention rates and increasing budgets, also known as NDR. We're seeing encouraging results from advertisers migrating to MAX conversion and AI, including double digit growth in NDR for advertisers who have migrated to MAX conversion versus ones was not and improving retention rates. Our main work here is to reduce calls, start by training our AI models and taking advantage of the massive amount of first-party data and clickstream to look for similar best advertisers and bring that know-how front and center. Switching gears to our second top priority this year ramping up. We're on track to complete the migration by midyear as planned, and we continue to make progress migrating Yahoo's Tier one omnichannel advertisers switchable on. And we've achieved our goal in Q1 to exceed $100 million in revenue on our supply. While there is still a lot of work to be done, we couldn't be more pleased with the partnership with Yahoo. The work between our leaderships at encouraging performance advertisers are seen when using tablet technology. One was a success story was with one of the world's largest personal finance software companies where the ads performance was so strong that they increased their budget more than two times over the course of the campaign and are now one of the largest advertisers under Taboola network. If there was ever a proof that AI matters, this is a good example of it. We spoke last quarter about our relationship with Apple, and I'm happy to share that it has now expanded to new markets. Previously, Apple has selected us to monetize Apple News and Apple stocks as an authorized reseller starting in Australia and Canada. And just recently, we expanded our role to serve as an authorized reseller for Apple News and Apple stocks in the US and UK markets. I could not be more proud of the tubular team supporting our efforts here, and we have a lot to learn as we onboard this amazing new partnership and I remain confident that Apple will become one of our most important partners. Turning now to our growth engines to revenues, e-commerce and our better overall product innovation and commercial wins continue to drive our momentum here. Our key investments, particularly news is getting more vertical videos, real-time content onto it, similar to what you're seeing on Instagram or Snap. And we're seeing great user engagement. In addition, while introducing various utilities, users may like to engage with such as weather or gaming and more. And our ambition here is to over the next many, many years to have people spend over 20 minutes a day with us. My product team likes to refer to it. We have a chance to become the main dish on the e-commerce front, we had a great quarter, growing solid double digit and exceeding our expectations. Again, we launched Associated Press new e-commerce site powered by Taboola, and it's beautiful. We should check it out, it's called AP. Buyline. It gives people a chance to check product reviews and make decisions that matter to them, leveraging the trust of AP and our relationships with retailers We also recently integrated with Amazon's DSP to allow Amazon sellers to extend their budgets into Taboola. As an example, let's say you have a store in Amazon and you want to reach buyers in the open web. You can now extend your reach using Amazon's DSP unattainable or Open Web network of publishers. Our header bidder is still small, but the potential here over time is to integrate across our thousands of publishers, including Yahoo into their display stack, which is an opportunity that can be quite meaningful. We are extremely excited by the prospects of our tubular growth engines and our ability to create synergies with our core business over the long term. In summary, we're coming in strong into 2024, exceeding our high end of guidance across all metrics, expecting double digit growth in Q2 over last year, while reiterating our 2024 guidance making this year a record year for us, our revenue growth is accelerating while having a strong EBITDA of over $200 million and over $100 million of free cash flow, we're continuing our $1 billion of buyback authorization and we're laser focused this year on advertiser success, which should result in sales growth and ramping up Yahoo. With that, let me pass the call to Steve to review our financials and outlook in more detail."", 'Stephen Walker', ""Thanks, Adam, and good morning, everyone. As Adam mentioned, we had a strong start to 2024. Our Q1 revenues were approximately $414 million and grew 26% year over year, accelerating from Q4 levels. X-tack gross profit was $139 million, which represented growth of 20% year over year X-Tack growth was driven by double digit growth in advertising spend as we onboarded Yahoo. Advertisers and saw the benefit of having Yahoo supply available through our platform as well as by accelerating growth in our e-commerce business. In addition, we saw double digit growth in our premium brand and advertising demand spend, which included strong organic growth as well as the transitioning of advertising spend from Yahoo's platform to boule. One note on our financials that is new this quarter on each of our financial statements in our 10-Q, you will note related party callouts, for instance, on our income statement, you will see that we call out related party revenue and traffic acquisition costs. As you might guess those related party numbers are for Yahoo. Traffic acquisition cost disclosure is relatively simple. This is the revenue share we pay to Yahoo and it flows through to payables on the balance sheet and change of payables in the cash flow statement. The related party revenue is not quite as simple to understand. There are three types of advertisers spending on Yahoo. Supply. First, there are what we have historically called omnichannel advertisers. These are advertisers that buy multiple advertising formats through the Yahoo. Dsp display, video and native. They are still billed and collected by Yahoo. But all of the native revenue is spent on the two bullet platform. So they are recognized by people as revenue and appear as related party revenue. The second type of advertiser is an advertiser that historically was only spending on native through Yahoo. No display video or other formats and has now been transitioned to bull. These advertisers do not appear in related party revenue because they're now billed and collected directly by tubular. So they are not the customer related party. The last type of advertiser is an advertiser that had not historically spent through the Yahoo platform, but is now spending on Yahoo. Supply through that to build a platform. These are historical tubular customers or new customers that we have brought on. They also do not appear in related party revenue since they are billed and collected by to go on. I will note that there is a small amount of other revenue in the related party disclosure that is either from other related parties, companies related to Yahoo or other advertisers that spend through Yahoo on to go up but not through the DSP. However, these are very small part of the related party revenue. I will also note that the related party revenue also flows through to the balance sheet in the receivables line and into the cash flow statement in the change of receivables. I hope that help explains what is in the related party disclosures. Now let me get back to our regularly scheduled programming. In Q1 Our net loss was $26.2 million, and our non-GAAP net income was positive $3.8 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $23.5 million, representing a 17% adjusted EBITDA margin year over year. Adjusted EBITDA was down, which was due primarily to higher expenses related to the onboarding of Yahoo supply that were not in the year-ago period and which preceded the full benefit of Yahoo advertiser transitions. Free cash flow benefited from the strong stronger than forecasted adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by the expenses related to the onboarding of Yahoo. We are very happy that our teams drove accelerating revenue and ex tech performance in Q1 through the remainder of the year, we expect improving cost efficiency, especially as the revenue from Yahoo. Advertiser transitions catch up with the associated costs, which will drive margin expansion. Operating expenses were $127 million in Q1, up $9 million year over year as a result of the costs incurred to onboard the significant inventory we are gaining with the addition of Yahoo. We continue to focus on cost discipline despite the hiring required to support onboarding Yahoo. Our headcount is still roughly flat relative to its peak in July of 2022. With this ongoing expense discipline and our strong growth expectations, we continue to expect that in 2024, we will approach our long-term adjusted EBITDA margin target of 30%. Gaap net loss for Q1 of $26.2 million included amortization of intangibles of $15.9 million, share-based compensation expenses of $13.8 million and hold back compensation expenses related to the connection to the acquisition of $2.6 million, all of which were excluded from non-GAAP net income. Our non-GAAP net income of $3.8 million was above the high end of our guidance range. In terms of cash generation, we had approximately $32.4 million in operating cash flow in Q1 and free cash flow of $26.8 million. This includes net publisher prepayments, which were a source of cash of $7.3 million and interest payments on our long-term debt, which were a use of cash of $3.6 million. As I have highlighted in previous quarters. I would note that net publisher prepayments were a source of cash this quarter due to the fact that new prepayments were lower than the amortization of historical prepayments. Let's turn to the balance sheet, you can see that our net cash balance remains healthy. Our net cash position of $35.5 million remained positive at the end of Q1 even after share repurchases, cash and cash equivalents, plus our short-term investments were $181 million at the end of Q1. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments remained above our long-term loan balance of $145.5 million. Speaking of our share repurchases, we repurchased $28 million of shares in Q1. We still have $92 million of authorizations under our previously announced $100 million expansion of our repurchase plan. When we initiated our buyback program, we stated that our intent was to at least offset any dilution and maintain our issued and outstanding shares at end of Q1 2023 levels. You can see that we have exceeded that goal as our issued and outstanding shares at the end of Q1 2024 were lower than the end of Q1 2023 by almost 5 million shares. In terms of future use of cash, we continue to be able to fund our organic growth investments from our operating cash flow. As we said last quarter, we believe that at current valuations, the best use of our free cash flow is to buy back shares. To the extent that we have additional cash to deploy, we will consider paying down our long-term debt. As always, both share repurchases and early retirement of debt are contingent upon the availability of sufficient working capital. I'm also happy to report that the process in Israel for share repurchases has been updated for Israeli companies like to Bourla with securities listed outside Israel. Under the new process, we must post the notice on our website that we intend to buy back shares. And if no creditors object within 30 days, we can begin the buybacks. The process still requires our board to conclude that we meet a financial strength test as specified in the rules. So going forward, you may see us post notices of our intention to buy back shares to our investor page. Now let me shift to our forward looking guidance. Two important expectations are included in this guidance first, while there is significant work left to be done, we expect the Yahoo advertiser migration to be complete by the middle of this year, and we will continue ramping Yahoo into 2025. Second, we expect yield growth to turn positive in 2024 as the volume of our contextual data increases with the addition of Yahoo and other supply to our network and our investments in performance advertising, bear fruit. As I mentioned, we are very happy with the strong start to 2024, and we are reiterating our guidance for 2024. This guidance implies strong top line growth and improving profitability. We expect revenue of $1.89 billion to $1.94 billion, which represents growth of 33% at the midpoint. We expect gross profit of $535 million to $555 million and X-Tack gross profit of $656 million to $679 million. That ex is up roughly 25% year over year at the midpoint, we are reiterating our 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance of over $200 million and free cash flow expectation of over $100 million. I will note that the adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow guidance represents roughly a doubling of both metrics versus 2023. Finally, we are expecting non-GAAP net income of $84 million to $104 million in 2024. We are also introducing Q2 2024 guidance. This quarter, we expect revenues of $410 million to $440 million, gross profit of $110 million to $120 million, X-Tack gross profit of $140 million to $150 million, adjusted EBITDA of $20 million to $30 million and non-GAAP net income of zero to positive $10 million. Let me finish by saying that we are very happy with our first quarter performance. Our growth is accelerating in 2024, and I'm looking forward to the step change we are expecting in our financials in 2024. The growth investments we have made in 2023. The additional scale that Yahoo is bringing and the additional supply, we will be onboarding as part of a new partnership with Apple is accelerating our journey towards becoming a must-buy for advertisers looking to reach consumers and the open web. And with that, let me pass it back to Adam for some closing remarks."", 'Adam Singolda', ""Thanks, Steve. In summary, it's great to see our business momentum and growth rates accelerating. It's an exciting time for us to hit the boiler seen our investments pending out. Starting with our financials, we started 2024 strong with a beat above our high end of guidance across all metrics, our growth rates are accelerating, which is good to see. In Q2, we're guiding for double digit growth versus Q2 of last year and 2024 is a record year for us overall with nearly $2 billion in revenue north of $200 million of EBITDA and over $100 million of free cash flow. We're executing on our buyback program, which demonstrates our confidence in our ability to execute and create shareholder value. When looking at our business, our top two priorities this year are making advertisers successful and ramping Yahoo. On advertiser success. Mix conversion is ahead with advertisers. After six months, it's almost 60% adoption. And advertisers who have adopted are generating double digit higher NDR. We're also focusing on attracting premium advertisers, which both select accessing our top 15% of our network, including Yahoo. Disney, Apple, NBC and others on Yahoo. We're on track to complete the migration by midyear as planned, and we crossed the $100 million in Q1 as we thought. Beyond that, we're seeing great momentum. Overall, our relationship with Apple is now extending to the U.S. and U.K. beyond Canada and Australia. Our growth engines, e-commerce, tubular news and header bidding are showing strong momentum and becoming more and more synergetic to our core business, making our publisher and advertiser business stronger. I'm excited to be exactly where we are. We know what we need to do. We have an incredible team all around the world working hard to build the very first must-buy advertising company for the open web. Thank you all for being part of our journey. And with that, let's open it up for questions. Operator?"", 'Operator', 'Thank you. At this time, we will conduct the question and answer session. (Operator Instructions) Laura Martin, Needham. Your line is now open.', 'Laura Martin', ""Good morning. Boy, there's a lot going on and great numbers guys. Congratulations. Yes, thank you, Laura. So my first question is on these priorities. I know that you're trying to onboard these omnichannel advertisers at Yahoo, but there's a lot that you're talking about in the shareholder letter about performance, high quality Pharmos appetite. So is this just an overall part of the strategy to just increase the total number of advertisers. I'm surprised that the Yahoo priority is that number one and that you've elevated this performance high quality performance advertisers to be a higher priority than Yahoo. Can you speak to that, please?"", 'Adam Singolda', ""Yes, sure, Ira. And looking forward to seeing you very soon, the event. So So overall with Yahoo. One thing that we're seeing, and I mentioned a letter also an interesting case study of a performance advertiser, one of the largest personal finance advertiser that was able to migrate and double the spend. One, Susan, the Tubular Technology in general, we're seeing something that is fairly new to us, which is we're premium advertisers that are great names in Oahu and Verizon, Samsung and names were mentioned before, are coming on board there. And when they're seeing good performance, their ability to spend a lot more is and it's quite exciting and to do willing to pay a premium for doing so, which is also why we at launch to build a Select, which is a way to essentially create like this index of the top of our company wide network between Yahoo and Apple and known design and BC. and DBC. and others, and to allow advertisers to buy a specific kind of like segregated ad unit, a standalone ad unit and pay a premium for it. So what we think is that there's an opportunity for us to grow our portion of kind of top tier performance brand advertiser. And again, this is not us top of the funnel kind of retention play. This is our by far our performance focus using the Numax conversion pixel on page, all the things we like, however, coming from agencies and brands and a lot of it, we've learned from the partnership with Yahoo. So that's why we're thinking a lot about it. That's why we've launched a with select. And that's that's a lot of what it excites me because I think as the world grows from two to three to $4 billion in revenue. There's an opportunity to become much more kind of share of wallet for brands and agencies, but performance focused on it. I think it also is an opportunity to elevate our company overall quality. So I like where it's going, and that's why I was thinking about it. What is your question about why I think performance advertisers actually the number one priority. And then by far actually maybe the number two, three and four is because I see such an opportunity to accelerate yields from where we are over the next many, many years. And if you think about that, if you can double the Company's yield, you double the Company's revenue and I think we can double and triple double it by just growing yield. And that is by far the biggest thing we can do for our company and shareholders. So we have the biggest focus on that from the performance advertising tech team or sales team, even our work with Yodle, suggesting that for top line over the next three to five years, yield expansion is by far the biggest thing we can do. And of course, in 2020 for Yahoo, is the biggest thing we have going on."", 'Laura Martin', ""Okay, very helpful. And then secondly, I was intrigued in the shareholder letter, you set a goal of 30 minutes of engagement a day. Could you talk about where your engagement is today and what but the core drivers of engagement growth are. How do you bridge the gap between what your engagement level is today in terms of minutes and like what is it you're going to do where the tools to get to that 30 minutes of engagement to date, which is your call?"", 'Adam Singolda', ""Yes, or the biggest driver for that is to be the news as far as we see today. So what happens is to build a new is more and more OEMs are integrating us to be in the what they call lock screen, Alex going, which is even before the consumer economy is interacting with the device itself. And then I was joking on earlier saying that my team is referring to that as the main dish, the crystal ball, it becomes the first thing they see before they even go to Facebook and Google or other apps so that we become the first thing consumers do and the average consumers of looking under lock screen over $100 times a day. Now what we see now is that over the last quarter and I mentioned that in my letter, we're introducing more and more vertical videos, think of it like reels or inadequate Snap is doing. And that is expanding engagement with consumers. And we're seeing acceleration in time and engagement. And because of that, our product roadmap this year is more and more getting oriented around one video, specifically full-screen vertical video and to utilities. As an example, we're now introducing consumers to whether we're offering them games. We're offering them to CNO if you're Vargo, what does that mean? And so we're giving you more things that you might like using AI to personalize different utilities you might like to engage with. And thanks to that we're getting more time with consumers. So we didn't share it to bill in your current kind of time. But I can tell you it's in the single digit as of now, but growing. We have some cases when it's more than 10 minutes. And I believe that over the next many, many years, my aspirations to get this to be kind of consistently double digit or 20 minutes a day. And I know my philosophy is that if you get people's time over time, you build a great business around that. So if you build something that consumers want and they use it again and again, and again, the revenue follows. And that's why we like to build a news because one, I think it helps us to become even more important to consumers. But again, it's mega synergetic to our core because Daniel, you click to go to a publisher site. It's stimulus publishers, and it allows us to become a growing source of traffic to publishers and especially with Gemini and bar, the Gemini, all the things, I think it matters to publishers a lot."", 'Laura Martin', 'Very helpful. Thank you, Adam, very much.', 'Adam Singolda', 'Sure.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Please stand by for us question. [Mac Down] of Citizens JMP. Your line is now open.', 'Mac Down', ""Thank you for taking my questions. My first one is just after a strong beat in 1Q relative to your guidance, you left the full year guidance unchanged. If there's something that's happening in the macro or otherwise, it's preventing you from raising your guidance. And then my second question is just as you're expanding your coverage of Apple News and Apple stock to the US and UK. Can you just help contextualize the opportunity and how you expect this to impact financials in 2024? Thank you so much."", 'Stephen Walker', ""Yes. So good question on the guidance. So in terms of our full year guidance, where we're obviously happy that Q1, we grew 26% year over year on a revenue basis and 20% year over year on a stack basis. So it was a very strong quarter for us and we expect improved adjusted EBITDA margins as we move to the back half. So we're still expecting our full year adjusted EBITDA margins to be 30% or at least to approach 30%. So I think we're pretty happy with where we are 2024. In fact, is going to be a record year for us. It will be our highest X-Tack and highest adjusted EBITDA on record. So overall, we think the guidance is really strong. We feel good about where we're at, but it's still very early. So while we feel very good about where we're at with, there's a lot of work to do and we don't want to adjust the rest of the year yet being as early as it is. So we're very happy with where we stand. We're just not ready to change the full year at this point in terms of Apple opportunity?"", 'Adam Singolda', ""Yes, we don't like to speak about any specific accounts or threes, as you can imagine. But what I can tell you is one it's very exciting for us to work with a company like Apple in oh nine in four markets and obviously the UK and the US are great markets to expand our relationship with we do think that this drives two things for us as a company. One following on also Laura's question, this is a very good anchor kind of our step forward towards people are giving premium advertisers yet another way to reach consumers. So there's no more premium than Apple, and that's that's really awesome for us to have that relationship and offer that to brand quality advertisers that are looking for performance. So that's one. It fits perfectly well with our kind of elevating and getting even more access to top brands all around the world and to we do believe that Apple has a chance of becoming one of our largest partners. So I'm comfortable saying that without getting into specifics."", 'Mac Down', ""Thank you so much. That's helpful."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Zach Cummins, B. Riley Securities. Your line is now open.', 'Zach Cummins', ""Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the strong Q1 results. I really just had a follow up question around kind of the assumptions that are baked into your Q2 guidance here in how we should think about the progression going into the second half of the year, just based on the unchanged outlook. And then part two is just with the expanded Apple relationship can you talk about kind of the additional work on the development side that's going to be required as you continue to onboard and ramp that relationship in second half of this year? Yes."", 'Adam Singolda', ""So what's the what's the question about the Q2 guidance, those specifically?"", 'Zach Cummins', 'And just just key assumptions that are baked into that versus I mean, the strong performance out of the gate here and kind of how we should think about the progression into the second half of the year to hit that full year guidance range of three firms.', 'Adam Singolda', ""Got it. So I think in terms of the Q2 guidance and frankly, the full year guidance, the most important assumptions that we're making there are one that the Yahoo is fully ramped by midyear. So there's still a lot of work to do. There were, but we're making good progress. I think Adam alluded to earlier how we are seeing some really good results from some of the advertisers we brought across, but we got to finish that work and get the rest of the advertisers across so that, that's assumption. One is that that happens, we're also assuming that in the back half of the year, especially, we start to see some yield gains as we basically from those new advertisers that we're bringing across and from our own work on performance advertising that we start to see benefit from that and we start to gain some yield assumptions or some yield gains as a result. And then I think the other kind of basic assumption that we've made, which I think we talked about last quarter is that operating expenses will kind of be running at roughly Q4 levels for the year. So from a EBITDA basis, that's the basic assumption. But I think the most important two assumptions are the first two Yahoo. Ramping by midyear, and we start to see some yield gains gains as we move into the back half in terms of dev work required to make Apple's successful? Yes, I don't think there's anything. It's a it's a publisher partner of ours. So there's nothing that is dramatically special or unique or different about. It's I think all the work that we're doing on making performance advertisers successful and the performance advertising work that applies to Apple, just like it applies to any of our other publishers. So I don't think there's anything particularly unique. Obviously, they're a big partner. They have their own requirements, but that's true any of our publishers. So nothing really unique there."", 'Zach Cummins', 'Great. Thanks for taking my questions.', 'Adam Singolda', 'Thanks, Zach.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. James Kopelman, TD Cowen. Your line is now open.', 'James Kopelman', 'Good morning and thanks for taking the question. First one is for Adam. You mentioned financial advertisers doubled their campaign budget or more than doubled. What was the role of AI. specifically in the success that they experienced? And how will that potentially reach reap larger benefits as more advertisers take advantage of your AI and JNI tools. And then also, I also wanted to ask about retention rates, which you mentioned benefit from training your AI models. Question is how much of your R&D budget are you allocating toward training AI models over time? And then I have a follow-up for Steve.', 'Adam Singolda', ""Sure. Good morning and good questions. So on the first question, next, conversion and AI play an incredibly important part of advertiser success. And in this case, what you're saying is is a fantastic brand name that we all know that's migrating to use to bolus core technology to roll the ads with MAX conversion and what they're seeing. And but their objective was in a very lower funnel specific metrics. They were looking to get. And once starting to work with us, they had an initial spend goal which were significant by the way, and the results were so great that they were they decided to double the spend. I don't know if that, you know, doubling came from someplace else, but I was happy to see it. But I can tell you it was all driven by AI and specifically showing that cost per acquisition is well within the range or whether we're expecting an even better. And you know, like like I told my Board yesterday, we had a meeting. I said all I want to just 1,000 of those, right? I just want to see that again and again and again, because at the end of the day. If you think about Triple M, we now reach about 600 million people a day DAUs, so roughly the size of Snapper. So and so we have significant reach and a lot of supply. So for me, if I can continue to make advertisers successful and get more budgets, I truly believe we can double and triple the company and that is why this is the number one priority for the company. And that is why we invest so much from the product and tech team on making performance advertisers successful and ideally top tier performance advertisers successful in terms of amortization, nearly half of our R&D works on a variety of different things relating to performance advertising. And I can tell you now that team presents to the Board. Every board. It's top of mind for our management team, our Board and us as a company. In terms of financials, I'm not sure if which are specifically how much dollar wise, but it's about half of our tech team. He's working on that."", 'James Kopelman', ""And then you also asked a little bit about retention rates. So I think we disclosed in this in our shareholder letter this time that our the NDR of our advertisers that are using our AI and our new like our new tools, there have double digits improvements in their NDR, which is a great measurement of kind of how they're doing. We haven't disclosed any new information about advertiser retention rates, but obviously your NDR can't be that positive if you're losing your advertisers. So it's obviously a good sign."", 'Adam Singolda', ""Yes, I think you were asking. So what do we do now? And again, within the sort of financial cost of that. That's what we're doing it. We're essentially and that's a big transition in 2024. We're spending a lot more resources on training or AI to from a cold start perspective to look at historic data so that we can create list of recommendations that are taking advantage in a greater way from advertisers that are like you. So if you're starting a campaign with double that today. Please remember, as I said earlier, that's one of the biggest opportunities and challenges around advertiser retention is shown and success really, really fast the faster you can get them conversions, the less likely to churn. So what we're doing now is we're training our models in a significant new way to take advantage of historic data and create a better list of recommendations that can come faster to consumers so that hopefully we can make conversions come earlier in the process and from that increase retention rates so that's what we're doing now. And we've mentioned that in the letter."", 'James Kopelman', 'And then just one last one for Steve. On the cadence for sales and marketing expense through 2024, it is your biggest OpEx line. Can you just remind us what are the key drivers this year for sales and marketing? And should it should that expense line continue to rise sequentially throughout the year, given your various investments? And do you have any other call-outs across OpEx as we go through the year?', 'Stephen Walker', ""Yes, I think so. Generally, we've hired most of the people that we're going to hire. Most of this hiring, by the way in sales and marketing is to support the transition of advertisers from Yahoo to LA and to support kind of that revenue jump. So we've hired most of what we're going to hire at this point. Q1 was a mostly full quarter for that. So while there probably will be a slight step up going forward. It's not going to be very large. So generally speaking, I think we're at about the right level, at least now, let's say we've got work left to do. We're going to finish that work over the next couple of months. And by midyear, we're supposed to be fully ramped, then we'll reevaluate. We'll just see where we're at and see if there's any need for additional resource or anything like that. But as of now, the expectation is we have what we need. And like I said, the only other call-out I would give is that we think that we're going to be roughly flat on operating expenses from here for the rest of the year. So I think generally we feel good about where we're at with the caveat that we'll reevaluate once we have all those advertisers on board and we understand what we need to do."", 'James Kopelman', 'Great. Thanks, guys. I appreciate all that.', 'Adam Singolda', 'Thanks, James.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Jason Helfstein, Oppenheimer. Your line is open.', 'Jason Helfstein', ""Thanks, to your question. So two questions on just one on the progress around Europe and given you did $100 million in the quarter, and I think we had like a 450 target for the year. It would seem like you're definitely going to track above that given the seasonality. So and I don't know if you want to kind of help us think about what the new number would be, whether it's like 500 by 50. And then second, on the bag area would imply like, you know, the business is down for other. We have talked about how it's not really a fair way to look at it for a host of reasons, but were there any specific pockets of weakness either on a product side or geographic side or ad category side that we need to be mindful for on that in the quarter? Thanks."", 'Adam Singolda', ""Also hedging. Morning. No, so one, you know, we already crossed the $1 million as we expected, which is great to see. We'd like we'd like to see that things we say happen. And I think at this point we're looking at. Yes, as part of our core, similar to Apple, Apple's similar to other big, big partners, we have in a way that we have one source of demand and that demand has been distributed across multiple types of publishers, some big and some small and now is obviously a big publisher. So from that perspective, in our core, if you do that type of math is growing double digits, which is good to see. So from that perspective, I'm happy and I'm happier even to see performance advertisers that are spending and migrating and getting good results. We spoke about that earlier today. So things are things are moving as we'd like to see. We're on track to complete the migration by midyear as we planned. And again, there's a lot of work ahead of us. So we're not taking it lightly. It's obviously ramping a big, a big partnership.

With revenue from top brands agencies growth and 20% of revenue mark up, what efforts are driving the recent success you're seeing with these advertisers? And with the introduction of tubular Select, is there anything you can share in terms of early reception from these premium and advertisers and how you believe this expands the opportunity with us go to advertisers?"", 'Stephen Walker', ""Yes. Thanks for the thanks for the question, Jacob. So what we can say is what's driving success for those advertisers? And why is our premium kind of brands and agencies business growing to above 20%? I think it's a combination of factors as with anything. It's not one thing. So Adam spoke earlier about the fact that we're seeing really good performance of MAX conversions and our high technology for those advertisers. So that's definitely a big part of it. So I think the financial advertiser that we talked about who came across and spent, I know a lot more than they even expected to because it was working so well for them. That's a big part of it like when the technology works, you get more budget, but we've also had a sales focus on this. So we have built out capabilities and teams that are specifically targeting and building relationships with major brands and agencies. And that's helping what we realized is that with the with the success we're seeing with the technology being that the state is we then announced two bullets select because we think we're at the right time and in the right position now to package everything together into an offering for these large brands and agencies that we think works really well. Technology works. We've got the right inventory, like if you think about the quality of our publisher inventory and what's happened to it over the last year, we've added Apple. We've added Yahoo. We've built our relationship with Microsoft Live. We have really, really high quality supply that has grown dramatically. We've got technology that's working for them. And now we've got the sales capability. So we decided to put it all together into an offering called two bullets select that we think is now at the right time and place to really succeed. So that's kind of how it all came together. So the success culture and technology, it comes from sales focus. It comes from the right having the right supply. And we're now at the right time and moment to really package together and go sell it aggressively."", 'Justin Patterson', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Mark Zgutowicz, Benchmark Company. Your line is now open for you guys.', 'Mark Zgutowicz', 'This is Alex on for Mark. Thanks for taking the questions. Could you perhaps quantify the e-commerce revenue ex tag penetration in 1Q and what you factored into your growth expectations throughout the year? As you lean into these new relationships? And then how should we be thinking about the extract margin accretion potential from this mix shift to e-commerce over the near and medium term? Thank you.', 'Adam Singolda', ""So we don't break out our e-commerce business specifically. So I'll give you kind of some flavor of what we have said historically. So first of all, what we've said is that e-commerce is growing faster than the rest of our business. So that's great, Mike. It's a growing part of our business. What's excited about that by the way is that e-commerce demand in particular is extremely high-quality. So it's coming from a combination of merchants like Walmart and Target and other people like that as well as from brands selling directly themselves like a Wayfair or a, um, Skechers or companies like that. So it is a we're showing really good momentum. It's exceeding the growth rate of the rest of our business and we expect that that's going to continue. So that's kind of what we've disclosed about e-commerce. Again, we haven't really disclosed how much of the breakout it is over time in terms of what's the opportunity to kind of grow X-Tack margins over time, especially especially relative to e-commerce? So first of all, what we've said is we expect to be at around 35% ex tax margin this year. That's kind of the midpoint of our guidance. We've said that we think that we have an opportunity to get that back up to 40% and beyond that over time. And part of that will be growth of e-commerce. E-commerce we report on a net basis. So it's highly accretive to our exact margins just because of that. But even beyond that, it's a really high value demand and helps us with our margins overall. So I think we do believe we have a good opportunity to grow our exact margins back above 40% over time and a part of that will be from e-commerce."", 'Mark Zgutowicz', 'Great.

Q1 showed a great momentum in the business, hitting the high end of our guidance, reiterating 2024, which makes this year a record year for us. Our growth rates are accelerating, which is great to see. And then our top two priorities are advertiser success and ramping Yahoo. Both are doing well. Apple News is now expanding our last quarter.

We had a lot of wins, including the acquisition of over 1.2 million new customers, half of which are younger consumers, which bode well for our brands. We maintained our full year EPS outlook.”', 'But the quarterly report came with some pain, too.', 'Net earnings for the third quarter would have been up slightly if not for $51 million in professional fees and the cost to carry the debt necessary to fund Tapestry’s $8.5 billion deal to buy Capri Holdings, which is being challenged by the FTC. Ultimately, the company’s third-quarter net income slipped 25.3 percent to $139.4 million, or 60 cents a share.', 'Adjusted earnings took some of that edge off, coming in at 81 cents a share and handily beating the 68 cents analysts projected, according to FactSet.', 'Revenues for the three months ended March 30 decreased 1.8 percent to $1.48 billion from $1.51 billion amid what the company described as “a challenging consumer backdrop” in North America. The top-line forecast for the year was also trimmed with net revenues expected to be flat at $6.6 billion — below the $6.7 billion the company forecast in February.', 'Third-quarter sales in North America fell 3 percent and were partially offset by a 3 percent increase abroad, in constant currencies. Revenues in Europe rose 19 percent while Japan was up 2 percent and China was down 2 percent.', 'Crevoiserat said she is well aware of just how the dynamic market is right now, with consumer confidence sagging and inflation lingering.', '“We are eyes wide open,” the CEO said. “We’re not immune to those dynamics. We have a prudent plan and [are] managing our business for healthy business long-term, protecting that long-term brand health. We’re confident in the runway for growth in the future.”', 'Crevoiserat said Tapestry, which owns Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman, can build strong connections with shoppers even as the consumer landscape weakens.', '“It’s great to play in a category that consumers have an emotional connection to,” she said. “So our core [handbag] category is one that consumers continue to engage with. They have an emotional connection, and it has kept the category resilient and durable through tough times. The category itself has grown midsingle digits historically very consistently. We expect that to continue and we see that in our brand tracking strong intent to purchase in our category.”', 'Tapestry has been successful at building up Coach, which logged sales of $1.1 billion in the quarter, a 2 percent rise in constant currencies. But Kate Spade, which isn’t backed up by the long history that Coach enjoys, hasn’t fared as well and saw its sales fall 5 percent in constant currencies to $280.7 million. Stuart Weitzman’s sales were down 17 percent in constant currencies to $56.1 million.', 'But Crevoiserat is bullish that the Coach playbook will work for Kate Spade, and, should the deal go through, Capri’s Michael Kors.', '“We see tremendous opportunity to improve the execution at Michael Kors,” she said. “The brand awareness is very strong, brand equity is very strong and it’s globally scaled. We see tremendous opportunity to unlock value with this strong consumer awareness. We see an opportunity to bring more relevancy and more innovation to the brand.”', 'Scott Roe, chief financial officer and chief operating officer of Tapestry, added that the company’s data-savvy consumer insights platform can be brought to bear, and is sometimes underappreciated by the outside world.', '“Our direct-to-consumer model, which gives us quick feedback loops, is helpful in many ways,” Roe said. “It helps us make better decisions, but we’re not infallible. We still don’t make all the right decisions, but when we miss, we see it quickly and we take action.”', 'Shares of Tapestry rose 3.6 percent to close at $40.37 on Thursday. But longer term, investors are likely focused less on the ins and outs of the quarter than on the fate of the potentially transformative deal to buy Capri.', 'Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, said Tapestry “is running out of steam and its ability to punch out strong results is becoming increasingly inconsistent.', '“Bringing on board Capri provides Tapestry with more levers it can pull to engineer better numbers,” Saunders said. “There is nothing wrong with this approach, even if the price offered for Capri is very toppy, but the intervention of the FTC into the case has thrown something of a wrench into the works.”', 'In its case against the acquisition, the FTC has argued that the buyout would make Tapestry a “colossus” in the accessible luxury handbag space with undue influence over the prices for consumers and employment in the sector.', '“With the goal to become a serial acquirer, Tapestry seeks to acquire Capri to further entrench its stronghold in the fashion industry,” said Henry Liu, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition, when the case was launched last month.', 'Tapestry has clamped back hard, saying in recent court filings that the case against the acquisition “makes no sense.”', 'The company has pushed regulators to identify exactly how they are defining the accessible luxury handbag market and argued FTC is fundamentally misunderstanding how the fashion market works.', '“There is no definable captive consumer of fashion handbags who cannot readily switch from brand to brand, across price ranges,” Tapestry said in court filings.', 'Crevoiserat still expects the deal to close this calendar year.', '“Our original timeline always contemplated the potential for litigation,” she said. “Unfortunately, that’s where we find ourselves. We’re working very, very diligently to work through that process and look forward to closing this transaction.

With $224 billion in net assets and an expense ratio of 0.04%, it is one of the most sizable and low-cost ways to invest in growth stocks.', 'If you believe that the top megacap growth companies will continue leading the market higher, consider the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF.', 'The ETF is very top-heavy, with 76% of the fund concentrated in the top 20 holdings and a whopping 87% of the fund in tech, consumer discretionary, or healthcare stocks.', 'The danger of an ETF like this is that just a few companies can move the whole fund. For example, if Microsoft and Apple take a hit, chances are other top tech stocks like Salesforce and Adobe will, too. A big sell-off in Nvidia would likely impact Advanced Micro Devices and other chip stocks.', ""The top holdings in the fund are the usual suspects of major growth stocks. But some names may surprise you, like Costco Wholesale, McDonald's, and Boeing. With just 79 holdings, the fund is more concentrated than other Vanguard funds. For example, the Vanguard Growth ETF has 199 holdings."", 'Between the Vanguard Growth ETF and the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF, the Vanguard Growth ETF stands out as the better option for investors looking for top growth stocks and greater diversification. But the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF is the best fit if you want even more exposure to the largest growth-orientated companies instead of a wider variety that incudes smaller (but still large) growth stocks.', 'With a 0.07% expense ratio, the fund is still a low-cost ETF.', 'The Vanguard Communications Services ETF tracks the performance of the communications sector -- which has been doing extremely well.', 'Communications is one of the more misunderstood sectors in the market. When you think of communications, it may be movies and entertainment, media, telecommunications companies, cable and satellite companies, etc. And while these companies certainly make up a sizable chunk of the fund, the sector is dominated by Meta Platforms and Alphabet. Combined, they make up a jaw-dropping 45.8% of the Vanguard Communications Services ETF.', ""Both Meta Platforms and Alphabet have been crushing the market as of late. But what makes both stocks particularly attractive is that they are cash cows with growth potential, they aren't overvalued, and they both recently announced they will begin paying dividends."", 'Meta has done a masterful job monetizing artificial intelligence (AI), particularly through Instagram. And Alphabet, which was heavily discounted relative to the S&P 500 just a few months ago, just proved in its recent quarter why it is a high-octane cash generator with explosive growth potential in AI.', 'Perhaps most attractive about Meta and Alphabet is that they are inexpensive, even after their recent run-ups. Despite their high growth rates, both companies have the lowest forward price-to-earnings ratios of the Magnificent Seven stocks.', 'Investors looking for the value side of the Magnificent Seven, who also want exposure to high-yield dividend stocks and proven media winners, could consider the Vanguard Communications Services ETF and its reasonable 0.1% expense ratio.', 'There are always risks associated with piling into what is working in the market. Stocks or ETFs that have been crushing the benchmarks have typically seen their valuations stretched thin. A sizable run-up is great for existing shareholders, but folks considering buying the stocks now need to make sure they are doing so for the right reasons -- namely because they believe competitive advantages are here to stay.', ""There's reason to believe that mega-cap growth and the Magnificent Seven can keep beating the S&P 500 and even the Nasdaq Composite for the simple fact that they have so many resources at their disposal and tend to be able to support large capital expenditures and research and development expenses. By comparison, a smaller company must be more precise and probably has more riding on a particular theme, idea, product, or service. A margin for error is crucial when embarking on the AI frontier or navigating a growth slowdown, as in the case of Apple or Tesla."", 'Vanguard ETFs remain an excellent low-cost way to gain exposure to what suits your personal investment objectives or interests.

It is leagues ahead of rivals such as Intel and AMD, which are still looking to cut their teeth in this market. For example, Nvidia is expected to sell $87 billion worth of AI chips this year. AMD and Intel, meanwhile, are expecting to generate $4 billion and $500 million, respectively, from AI chip sales this year.', ""Nvidia is clearly the go-to chipmaker for companies that are looking to train and deploy AI models, as its share of this market illustrates. The stock market has rewarded the company's dominance handsomely, which is evident from the 507% jump in its share price since the beginning of 2023. This stunning rally has brought Nvidia's trailing earnings multiple to 74, which is quite rich if you consider that the Nasdaq-100 index has an earnings multiple of 30 (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks)."", ""There is a solid chance that Nvidia can justify this expensive multiple with tremendous growth going forward. But there is an alternative for investors who are looking for a company that could replicate Nvidia's AI-driven success in a different market and is trading at an attractive valuation right now -- Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM)."", ""Let's look at the reasons why this chipmaker has the potential of becoming the next Nvidia."", 'Qualcomm is the second-largest manufacturer of application processors used in smartphones. The company controlled 28% of this market at the end of 2023, trailing the top-ranked manufacturer MediaTek by 5 percentage points.', ""One may argue that Qualcomm isn't as dominant as Nvidia in its field. However, it wouldn't be surprising to see Qualcomm eventually capture a bigger share of the smartphone processor market thanks to the proliferation of AI-enabled smartphones. On its May earnings conference call when management was discussing the company's fiscal 2024 second-quarter results (for the three months ended March 24), CEO Cristiano Amon said:"", 'In premium and high-tier smartphones, our Snapdragon mobile platforms continue to set the bar for performance and on-device gen AI capabilities. Recently launched flagship Android devices powered by Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 are seeing strong demand globally, especially in China.', ""More specifically, Qualcomm's revenue from chip sales to Chinese smartphone customers increased more than 40% year over year in the first half of the current fiscal year. This impressive year-over-year increase in Chinese revenue indicates that Qualcomm is making solid headway in a country where MediaTek is the leading player, and is aiming to corner 30% of the flagship smartphone market."", 'Qualcomm is looking to build upon its growing prominence in the Chinese smartphone market by bringing on-device AI capabilities ""to a broader range of flagship and high-tier smartphones with the new Snapdragon 8S Gen3 and Snapdragon 7 Plus Gen 3 mobile platforms, launching in the second half of 2024.""', 'All this explains why Qualcomm is expecting its growth to accelerate from the current quarter. The company delivered a revenue increase of just 1% in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 to $9.4 billion. It is forecasting $9.2 billion in revenue in the current quarter at the midpoint of its guidance range, which would be a 9% jump over the same period last year.', 'The company is expecting its earnings to grow at a faster pace of 20% year over year to $2.25 per share in the current quarter. Wall Street would have settled for $2.18 per share in earnings on $9.06 billion in revenue from Qualcomm, but the company is set to go past those expectations thanks to the growing demand for AI-powered smartphones and its improving influence in markets such as China.', ""That's not surprising, as the company's AI-capable smartphone chips are being deployed by leading smartphone OEMs (original equipment manufacturers). Qualcomm is looking to push the envelope in this space by focusing on bringing AI capabilities into mid-range smartphones as well."", 'In all, Qualcomm is setting itself up to make the most of the bustling market for generative AI smartphones, shipments of which are expected to grow at an eye-popping compound annual growth rate of 65% between 2024 and 2027, according to Counterpoint Research.', 'The generative AI smartphone market is currently in its early phases of growth. Counterpoint estimates that these devices will account for 11% of the overall smartphone market in 2024, and then grow to 43% of the market in 2027.

As a result, there is a good chance of Qualcomm becoming a bigger player in the smartphone chips market and replicating the success that Nvidia has seen in the AI chips market.', ""That's why investors would do well to buy Qualcomm at its current valuation. The stock sports a price-to-earnings ratio of 24, which is well below the multiples that Nvidia and the broader Nasdaq-100 index command. The forward earnings multiple is also attractive at 19. Moreover, as the following chart shows, analysts have been raising their earnings growth expectations from Qualcomm."", ""All this indicates that Qualcomm is capable of delivering stronger growth in the coming years thanks to lucrative catalysts such as the AI smartphone market, where the company is a key player.

The chip provides the Pro with a number of benefits including a faster CPU and updated graphics processing unit.', 'But it was Apple’s focus on the M4’s AI capabilities that stood out the most. Apple has been putting its neural engine into processors since 2017 and has previously talked up how it helps power a number of iPhone, iPad, and Mac features for some time.', 'But the M4 unveiling was different, serving as an appetizer for the AI features the company will present at its WWDC event in June, when Apple is widely expected to debut a slew of generative AI-powered software features for its various devices.', 'Apple pointed to a number of the M4’s AI bona fides during the keynote, with vice president of platform architecture Tim Millet specifically noting that the chip is capable of 34 trillion operations per second, a measurement commonly used when describing a chip’s AI performance.', 'Millet also said that the M4’s neural engine is more powerful than any neural processing unit in any AI PC. That’s a direct shot at Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and Qualcomm (QCOM), which are preparing to or are already rolling out their own AI PC chips designed to run large language models on Windows laptops and desktops.', 'Outside of the M4’s AI processing fundamentals, Apple was mum on any substantive discussion of AI software updates.

Professional and everyday investors have flocked to high-growth, innovation-driven businesses, and have been particularly enamored with Wall Street's next-big-thing investment trend: artificial intelligence (AI)."", ""With AI and machine learning, software and systems are given the ability to learn over time without human intervention. Being able to evolve and become more proficient at assigned tasks gives AI wide-ranging utility and multitrillion-dollar long-term potential. It's precisely why investors have piled into semiconductor stock Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and sent its market cap higher by nearly $1.9 trillion since 2023 began."", ""A quick review of Nvidia's headline growth figures demonstrates why investors can't seem to get enough of this stock."", ""In fiscal 2024, which came to a close on January 28, Nvidia reported total sales growth of 126%, with Data Center revenue climbing by a scorching-hot 217%. Nvidia's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) have become staples in AI-accelerated data centers, and are the go-to for businesses aiming to train large language models and run generative AI solutions on their cloud-based platforms."", ""But even with things going swimmingly for Nvidia, the high-water price target among Wall Street analysts is $1,400 from Hans Mosesmann at Rosenblatt. This implies Nvidia's peak upside over the next year is 58%, based on where the company's shares ended on May 3."", ""Despite this lofty price target, it's possible the infrastructure backbone of the AI movement is firmly in a bubble. Every next-big-thing investment trend over the last 30 years has endured a bubble during its early stages of expansion, and AI is unlikely to be the exception to this unwritten rule."", ""Furthermore, Nvidia has competition coming at it from all angles. External competitors are bringing newly designed AI-GPUs to market to compete directly with Nvidia's H100 chip. Meanwhile, Nvidia's top four customers, which comprise around 40% of its net sales, are developing in-house AI-GPUs for their respective data centers. In other words, Nvidia's upside appears limited."", 'Instead of focusing on a potential bubble stock, select Wall Street analysts see upside ranging between 223% and 557% for the following three small-cap stocks.', 'The first small-cap stock with truly jaw-dropping upside that could handily outpace Nvidia in the return column, at least based on the lofty price target of one Wall Street analyst, is hydrogen fuel-cell solutions company Plug Power (NASDAQ: PLUG).', ""According to analyst Amit Dayal of H.C. Wainwright, Plug Power stock can reach $18 per share. If accurate, this would represent upside of 557% compared to the $2.74 Plug shares closed at last week. Dayal believes the company's double-digit long-term growth projections, efforts to control its expenses, and incremental margin improvements, merit this aggressive price target."", ""On paper, Plug Power hasn't struggled to grow its sales. While its partnership with Amazon to supply some of its warehouses with hydrogen fuel-cell-powered GenDrive forklifts has helped Plug, the long-term buzz has to do with the green hydrogen infrastructure the company is developing to (pardon the pun) fuel cleaner transportation."", ""But just like Dayal's price target, these ambitions may be a bit too grand for a company that hasn't been able to keep its expenses under control. Though sales catapulted from $701 million to $891 million in 2023 from the previous year, its net loss more than doubled to about $508 million from around $194 million."", ""To make matters worse, Plug Power has been forced to sell shares of its common stock to raise capital as it burns cash. Even if the company secures a much-awaited $1.6 billion low-interest government loan from the U.S. Department of Energy, it doesn't provide an immediate remedy for the company's ongoing cash burn."", ""I'm no fan of Nvidia at a $2.2 trillion market cap. I might be even less of a fan of Plug Power approaching a $2 billion valuation."", 'A second small-cap stock with scorching-hot upside that could potentially run circles around Nvidia, based on the forecast of one Wall Street pundit, is pet-focused retail chain Petco Health and Wellness (NASDAQ: WOOF).', ""In a March note, analyst Anna Andreeva of Needham maintained her firms' buy rating on Petco and stood firm on her previously issued $5 price target. If Petco were to rally to this mark, shareholders as of May 3 would enjoy 223% upside!"", 'The lure of investing in the pet industry is simple: owners will gladly open their wallets to keep their furry, feathered, gilled, and scaled ""family members"" healthy and happy. The American Pet Products Association reported in April that ""total U.S. pet industry expenditures reached $147 billion in 2023,"" with aggregate spending on pets expected to grow annually through 2030. It\'s a recession-resistant industry that hasn\'t seen a collective sales downturn in more than a quarter of a century.', 'On paper, Petco Health and Wellness should be able to benefit from steady growth in U.S. pet ownership. Management has wisely been promoting higher-margin services, such as grooming, veterinary services, and pet insurance.', ""The major issue for Petco is that a portion of its outstanding debt sports variable rates. Since March 2022, the Federal Reserve has undertaken an aggressive rate-hiking cycle that's seen interest rates climb at their fastest pace in four decades. Put simply, Petco's operating cash flow is being gobbled up by debt-servicing expenses. That's less than ideal -- and its plummeting share price is indicative of this."", 'While I do believe Petco has the tools to right the ship, its liable to remain in the doghouse in the coming quarters.', 'The third small-cap stock with sensational upside potential, based on the prognostication of one Wall Street analyst, is biotech company Novavax (NASDAQ: NVAX).', ""Despite the Novavax stock chart looking like something straight out of a horror film, analyst Vernon Bernardino of H.C. Wainwright believes shares will hit $19. Given that Novavax ended the previous week at $4.93, Bernardino's aggressive price target implies a near-quadrupling over the next year."", ""The reason Novavax's stock chart looks so wild has to do with its promise and missed opportunity during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was one of a select few drug companies to successfully develop a COVID-19 vaccine. However, management delayed filing an emergency use authorization (EUA) application in the U.S., and the company struggled to increase vaccine production. Whereas Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech raked in tens of billions of dollars in sales from proverbial low-hanging fruit with their respective COVID-19 vaccines, Novavax missed out on virtually all of it."", ""On the other hand, Novavax's vaccine is differentiated. Whereas the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines rely on messenger-RNA (mRNA) technology, the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine is protein-based and teaches the immune system how to recognize the virus and fight back. It provides an alternate treatment pathway for people who might be apprehensive of mRNA technology."", 'Further, Novavax is working on a combination COVID-19/influenza vaccine that could hit pharmacy shelves as soon as 2026, assuming accelerated approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. This combo vaccine would almost certainly be a better revenue driver for the company than a seasonal COVID-19 vaccine.', 'Lastly, Novavax and global vaccine alliance Gavi reached a up to $400 million settlement in February that had been a major overhang for the company. Inclusive of significant cost-cutting efforts, Novavax has a genuine chance at becoming profitable on an operating basis by as early as next year.', ""Though Bernardino's price target is lofty, Novavax looks to have the intangibles needed to outperform Nvidia."", 'Before you buy stock in Plug Power, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Plug Power wasn’t one of them.

Results were roughly in line with estimates, with revenues of US$309b and statutory earnings per share of US$22.39. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. So we collected the latest post-earnings statutory consensus estimates to see what could be in store for next year.', ' See our latest analysis for McKesson ', ""Following the latest results, McKesson's 15 analysts are now forecasting revenues of US$351.5b in 2025. This would be a notable 14% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to leap 23% to US$28.21. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$337.8b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$27.81 in 2025. So it looks like there's been no major change in sentiment following the latest results, although the analysts have made a small increase to to revenue forecasts."", ""It may not be a surprise to see thatthe analysts have reconfirmed their price target of US$575, implying that the uplift in revenue is not expected to greatly contribute to McKesson's valuation in the near term. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. The most optimistic McKesson analyst has a price target of US$671 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$410. Analysts definitely have varying views on the business, but the spread of estimates is not wide enough in our view to suggest that extreme outcomes could await McKesson shareholders."", ""Of course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. It's clear from the latest estimates that McKesson's rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with the forecast 14% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2025 noticeably faster than its historical growth of 7.1% p.a. over the past five years. Compare this with other companies in the same industry, which are forecast to grow their revenue 6.7% annually. Factoring in the forecast acceleration in revenue, it's pretty clear that McKesson is expected to grow much faster than its industry."", ""The most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. Happily, they also upgraded their revenue estimates, and are forecasting them to grow faster than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$575, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets."", ""With that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year. We have estimates - from multiple McKesson analysts - going out to 2027, and you can see them free on our platform here."", ""However, before you get too enthused, we've discovered 1 warning sign for McKesson that you should be aware of."", 'Have feedback on this article?

I want to thank the 51,000 McKesson employees for their terrific efforts over the course of this year, as together we drove the business and achieved significant progress in advancing our mission and our strategies. In fiscal 2024, consolidated revenue grew 12% to $309 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share increased by 6% to $27.44, both exceeding the expectations we set out at the beginning of the fiscal year. We're pleased with the growth across the enterprise, supported by our differentiated portfolio of assets, our innovative solutions, and our deep commitment to quality and operational excellence."", ""We're particularly excited about the opportunities within our strategic growth pillars of oncology and biopharma services.

These are both pivotal assets that unlock tremendous value and bring significant benefits to our customers and stakeholders. Over the years, we've been building out our portfolio of assets around oncology, spanning from the distribution of related therapies to practice management to oncology data insights and other value added services. We're very pleased with the meaningful expansion in our oncology assets as reflected in the growth of the US Oncology Network. We welcomed four practices to the network in the fiscal year, including Regional Cancer Care Associates, Cancer Center of Kansas, Nashville Oncology Associates and SCRI Oncology Partners. The addition of these new practices expands our geographic footprint and allows us to provide our services to a broader set of providers and importantly, to the patients they serve."", 'As of April, the network has grown to approximately 2600 providers at 600 sites of care across 31 States. We grew the provider network through a combination of newly affiliated practices and the recruitment of new providers to existing practices. We saw organic growth in providers at more than 75% of the practices. With this extensive reach within the community oncology setting, the US Oncology Network now treats over 1.4 million patients each year. In addition to practice management, we also provide clinical trial services to these community based practices. In 2022, we expanded our clinical trial capabilities through the formation of a joint venture that now operates under the name of Sarah Cannon Research Institute or sometimes referred to as SCRI.', 'In the past year, practices in the US Oncology Network participated in over 200 clinical trials through SCRI, enrolling more than 3100 patients in treatment studies across various disease states. And in February, SCRI announced a collaboration with AstraZeneca to enhance the delivery of oncology clinical trials. Working together, the two parties will implement modern solutions to accelerate clinical trial delivery timelines, reduce site burden, and enhance trial enrollment within our scaled provider network. In addition to oncology, our other differentiated growth priority is our biopharma services platform. Our portfolio of connected solutions provides unique value propositions to biopharma companies and helps them improve medication access, affordability, and adherence.', ""In fiscal 2024, we saw strong growth in the prescription technology segment, delivering 23% growth in adjusted operating profit. More importantly, in the past year, our differentiated solutions helped patients save more than $8.8 billion on brand and specialty medications. We help to prevent approximately 10.7 million prescriptions from being abandoned due to affordability challenges, and we helped patients access their medicine more than 94 million times. The biopharma services platform was built through years of strategic investments. It includes targeted acquisitions that accelerated our growth strategy and internal investments that drove innovation and enhanced capabilities. One of the first assets we've acquired was RelayHealth, and it's foundational to the network and services we offer today."", ""For those who aren't familiar with this business, it helps adjudicate prescription claims and enable the efficient delivery of prescription drugs. It's now connected to over 50,000 pharmacies and processes billions of transactions annually. The connectivity to the pharmacies provides us insights into the patient's journey and helps us develop additional solutions, programs like copay assist programs and digital coupons. We want to provide our customers not just a claims switch solution, but a robust platform that connects key stakeholders, delivers access and affordability solutions, and ultimately improves the patient's experience and outcomes. Let's move on now to our next priority of driving sustainable core growth. We have scaled and durable assets in both pharmaceutical and medical surgical distribution and we continue to deliver sustainable growth in these core businesses."", ""In fiscal 2024, U.S. Pharmaceutical delivered solid results with 16% increases in revenue and a 7% increase in adjusted operating profit, which I'll remind you is at the high end of our long-term target for this segment. To support the business growth and the evolving needs of our customers, we continue to invest in our infrastructure, ensuring that the distribution assets are technologically equipped to maximize capacity and efficiency. And while we're still in the early stages of investing in capabilities of artificial intelligence, we've already developed tools and algorithms that apply AI in the supply chain. This is enabling us to move products more quickly and nimbly throughout our distribution centers, generating cost savings and continuing to improve our service levels."", ""We'll continue to make these targeted and strategic investments that support the sustainable growth of our business. Our core distribution business is also complemented by a growing portfolio of services and solutions around specialty and oncology, which adds to our differentiated market position and supports our unique value proposition to our customers. And today, we're excited to talk about our strategic relationship with Optum. We started servicing a portion of Optum's business last year and we're pleased to get the opportunity to expand the scope of our services starting July of 2024. We believe this relationship is a strong testament to our differentiated capabilities and services across pharmaceutical distribution, sourcing and oncology."", 'We look forward to the opportunity to serve and grow with all of our customers, including now Optum. As we assess investment opportunities and we allocate resources across the enterprise, we strive to ensure that our decisions align with our strategic priorities and with our mission of improving healthcare in every setting, we want to become not only a diversified healthcare services company, but also a company that enables positive changes in our communities and drives impact. In April, we launched a new initiative aimed at advancing health equity for at risk populations in underserved communities. We have a long history of working with pharmacies and providers in the community setting. Now we want to leverage our business resources and expertise to support their growth and enable better access to healthcare in many of these communities.', 'With this project, we look to identify and address pharmacy deserts where residents face significant challenges in accessing essential pharmacy services. We chose Avondale, Ohio as our pilot activation site. We helped facilitate an expedited path to an independent pharmacy ownership in the local community, and we opened the pharmacy this past December. I had the opportunity to be there personally and experienced the joy of those who live in that community, appreciating something that most of us take for granted; a pharmacy near our house. We look forward to making a lasting difference in more communities like Avondale in the future. We also support and fund many charitable works through the McKesson Foundation. This past year marked an important milestone for the Foundation as it celebrated its 80th anniversary.', ""During the last year alone, it funded nearly 50 organizations through its grant making program and disbursed approximately $9 million, one third of which supported direct patient care and assistance. We're also pleased to see continued increase in employee participation in these impactful initiatives. In fiscal 2024, McKesson employees put in over 44,000 volunteer hours with charities across the U.S. and Canada. I'm truly proud of what we have achieved as a team to support the communities and to live our purpose of advancing health outcomes for all. So let me pull that all together. McKesson delivered performance above our initial expectations in fiscal 2024, underpinned by continued momentum across the businesses. We finished the year with a growing portfolio of oncology and biopharma services solutions and an expanded core distribution business and a stronger culture that unites us all."", ""As we look ahead to our fiscal 2025, we're excited about the opportunities to grow our differentiated assets and capabilities. We remain deeply committed to our strategies and priorities and we're confident in our ability to drive sustainable business growth and generate attractive shareholder return. Team McKesson is more focused and more agile as we enter this new fiscal year with strength and confidence. With that, Britt, I'll hand it over to you."", ""Britt Vitalone: Great. Thank you Brian and good afternoon everyone. Fiscal 2024 marks another year of strong execution and financial performance. We enter fiscal 2025 with a momentum to deliver growth and create value for our customers, partners and shareholders. Today, I'll discuss our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2024 results. Then I'll provide an overview of our fiscal 2025 outlook. My comments today will refer to our adjusted results unless I state otherwise. We're exiting fiscal 2024 with solid performance, delivering earnings per diluted share of $6.18 in the fourth quarter and $27.44 for the full year. Our fourth quarter results were in line with our expectations and with the earnings per diluted share guidance range that we provided on our third quarter earnings call, demonstrating our ability to consistently execute against company priorities and create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders."", 'For the full year, when excluding fiscal 2023, contributions from COVID-related programs and McKesson Ventures, adjusted operating profit grew 9% and adjusted EPS increased 17%. These results were above our long range targets and reflect the strength of our products, services and operating execution. Let me start with a review of the fiscal fourth quarter. Revenues increased 11% to $76.4 billion, led by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment resulting from increased prescription volumes, including higher volumes from specialty products, retail national account customers and GLP one medications. Gross profit was $3.3 billion, an increase of 7%, primarily a result of specialty distribution growth within the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, including our leading plasma and biologics business.', ""Operating expenses increased 11% to $2.1 billion, driven by higher costs to support growth across the businesses. During the quarter, we recorded a reserve for environmental matters of $0.09 per share for increased remediation cost related to McKesson's former chemical business, which we disposed of several years ago. The environmental reserve was recorded in our corporate segment. Operating profit was $1.3 billion, which was flat to the prior year, driven by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment offset by increased corporate expenses which included the previously outlined environmental reserve. Year-over-year results were also impacted by anticipated lower contributions from U.S. Government COVID-19 programs in both the U.S. Pharmaceutical and medical-surgical solutions segments when compared to the prior year."", 'When adjusting for the COVID-19 programs and a modest McKesson Ventures loss in fiscal 2023, adjusted operating profit increased 4% in the quarter. Moving below the line, interest expense was $75 million, an increase of 7% driven by higher short-term borrowings of commercial paper compared to the prior year. The higher short-term borrowings resulted from lower average cash balances, in part due to the impact from the Change Healthcare outage. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 28.1%, which is in line with our previous guidance and driven by a discrete tax item. Fourth quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding was 131.6 million, a decrease of 5% year-over-year. Wrapping up our consolidated results, earnings per diluted share was $6.18, again in line with the implied earnings per diluted share that we provided on our third quarter earnings call.', ""While this represents a decrease of 14% compared to the prior year, fourth quarter results were principally driven by a higher tax rate and lower COVID-19 program contributions in fiscal 2024, partially offset by a lower share count and growth in U.S. Pharmaceuticals segment. Turning now to our fourth quarter segment results, which can be found on Slides 7 through 11 and starting with U.S. Pharmaceutical. Revenues were $68.8 billion, an increase of 12%, driven by increased prescription volumes, including higher volumes from specialty products, retail national account customers and GLP-1 medications. As we've previously guided, GLP-1 medications continue to show growth year-over-year, but despite this increase, the rate of growth continues to moderate."", 'In the quarter, GLP-1 revenues were $7.5 billion, an increase of approximately $1.5 billion, or 24% compared to fiscal 2023. However, GLP-1 revenues were flat on a sequential basis. For the quarter, operating profit increased 5% to $901 million, driven by growth in the distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems and increased contributions from our generics program.', 'CoverMyMeds: Results in the fourth quarter reflect organic growth across our access solutions, including prior authorization services, as we extended existing partnerships with biopharma manufacturers. In addition to the strength of our access solutions, year-over-year performance was also supported by higher volumes across our affordability solutions. Operating profit decreased 3% to $212 million, driven by higher costs and investments to sustain the momentum and growth across the biopharma services platform. This included incremental infrastructure investments and cost to deliver increasing levels of ROI for our customers. Operating profit was also impacted by lower third party logistics performance in the quarter as compared to the prior year.', ""Turning to Medical-Surgical Solutions, revenues were $2.8 billion, an increase of 6% and operating profit was $248 million, which was flat versus the prior year. Fourth quarter results reflect growth in the primary care and extended care businesses, including higher volumes of illness season testing, partially offset by lower contributions from the kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. Government's COVID-19 program compared to the prior year. As a reminder, each illness season is unique depending on the onset and severity of various respiratory illnesses during that particular year. Next, let me address our International results. Revenues were $3.5 billion, an increase of 6% and operating profit was $94 million, an increase of 18%."", 'These strong results were driven by higher pharmaceutical distribution volumes in the Canadian business compared to the prior year. Wrapping up our segment review, corporate expenses were $193 million in the quarter, an increase of 30%, driven by the previously discussed environmental reserve and higher technology, infrastructure and compliance spend. Let me now turn to cash and capital deployment, which can be found on Slide 12. We ended the quarter with $4.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents. For the fiscal year, we generated $3.6 billion in free cash flow, including $687 million of capital expenditures, which included new and existing distribution centers, as well as investments in technology, data and analytics to support our growth priorities.', ""During the quarter, several of our customers were impacted by the Change Healthcare outage, delaying billing functions and claims payments. This outage created a timing impact on McKesson's cash flows. However, the impact was less severe than we had previously indicated. We continue to focus on capital deployment to drive value for our stakeholders. In fiscal 2024, we returned $3.3 billion of cash to shareholders. We returned $3 billion through share repurchases at an average price per share of approximately $436, including $678 million of share repurchases in the fiscal fourth quarter. Additionally, we paid dividends of $314 million for the full year. When combining share repurchases with dividends paid, we returned approximately 92% of free cash flow to shareholders in fiscal 2024."", ""Since the beginning of fiscal 2019, we have returned $16.2 billion of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Of this amount, approximately $14.5 billion has been returned through share repurchases, reducing our total average shares outstanding by nearly 36%. The strength of our balance sheet and strong credit metrics, supported by our strong operating performance and disciplined and balanced financial policy, was recognized in the quarter by the recent Moody's credit rating upgrade to A3 from BAA1 and we are now A rated by two of the three major credit rating agencies. Our strong balance sheet and consistently robust cash flow generation, along with disciplined capital allocation, continues to provide us with the financial flexibility to invest in our growth initiatives, pursue strategic opportunities and return capital to shareholders, all while maintaining a durable capital structure."", 'Now, let me discuss our fiscal 2025 outlook. The breadth of our capabilities and leading portfolio of assets across oncology and biopharma services have led to value creation for our customers, partners and shareholders over the last five years. Our fiscal 2025 outlook is a continuation of this momentum. Let me start with our segments. We anticipate U.S. Pharmaceutical revenues to increase 16% to 19% and operating profit to increase 8% to 10%, propelled by sustainable momentum in the core distribution business and growth across our oncology platform. We continue to make investments in the core distribution network to deliver more efficiency and value for our stakeholders. The strength of our value proposition was highlighted by the recent agreement to build on our existing pharmaceutical distribution partnership with Optum.', 'This five-year contract begins on July 1 of 2024. The fiscal 2025 segment outlook incorporates stable growing prescription utilization trends bolstered by further growth in our generic sourcing programs and specialty distribution, including our leading plasma and biologics business.', ""Ontada: In the Prescription Technology Solutions segment we anticipate revenues to increase 18% to 22% and operating profit to increase 12% to 16%. This outlook reflects organic growth across our solutions and services as we expand and extend partnerships with biopharma manufacturers and increase the number of brands utilizing our access, affordability and adherence programs. Throughout fiscal 2024, we continued to see increased demand for our access and affordability solutions, particularly those related to GLP-1 medications. As a reminder, McKesson's prior authorization products serve the majority of the brands for GLP-1 medications. Our products continue to generate value for our partners. Looking ahead to fiscal 2025, we anticipate that this demand will remain elevated yet lessened as the rate of increase will be slower than prior years for GLP-1 medications."", ""The Medical-Surgical business remains well positioned to leverage the breadth and depth of its services and assets across all alternate sites of care, including growth in the primary care business and our comprehensive private label portfolio. We anticipate Medical-Surgical Solutions revenues to increase 4% to 8% and operating profit to increase 6% to 8%. Within the primary care market, we anticipate continued growth in lab solutions and specialty pharmaceuticals. Our scaled sourcing and distribution footprint has propelled expansion and growth of our private label portfolio, providing superior value for our customers while maintaining sound economics for McKesson. In fiscal 2025, we're making investments in the segment to support the recent acquisition of Compile, a healthcare data platform that captures and aggregates data to provide insights and analytics for biopharma."", ""We believe there's an initial use case across the breadth of the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment. The Medical-Surgical Solutions segment has broad relationships with providers and extensive data sets, leading to opportunities to develop incremental value creation opportunities. Longer term, there are increased opportunities to integrate the capabilities and commercial applications across our oncology and biopharma services platforms. These investments will deliver meaningful returns to the segment and to the enterprise. In fiscal 2025 we anticipate that these investments will account for an approximate 2% operating profit headwind in the medical segment as compared to the prior years. Finally, the International segment, we anticipate revenues to increase 4% to 8% and operating profit increased 6% to 10% year-over-year."", 'Our diversified set of assets within our Canadian business, including the scale distribution business, continues to support growth in the International segment. We continue to make investments in our Canadian technology footprint to create a more custom and integrated supply chain for specialty drugs. As a reminder, Norway remains the only operating country in Europe that we have not entered into an agreement to sell, and contributions related to operations in Norway are included in the fiscal 2025 outlook for the segment. We intend to exit Norway as part of the completion of our European exit. In the Corporate segment, we anticipate expenses to be in the range of $580 million to $640 million, which includes increased technology spend to support the growth of our businesses and infrastructure and compliance investments.', ""We will also continue to invest in data and analytics, including the acceleration of several investments in artificial intelligence. We are leveraging AI to increase the efficiency across our operations and increase automation and productivity for our customers. Our investments in AI and other advanced technologies play an important role in improving customer service and provider productivity. We continue to build these tools across the value chain to increase speed and success rates. One example where we're implementing AI is in our oncology platform. The InnoMed [ph] EHR contains structured data that can often be sparsely entered for patient's longitudinal records. Instead, unstructured data such as uploaded documents and provider authored notes are used to capture details on patient's disease condition in response to treatment, as well as many core clinical factors."", ""They have complete longitudinal patient records for real world research. Core variables are required to be extracted from the unstructured data into a well-organized database. Natural language process is the only scalable solution to achieve more than 100 million documents in InnoMed [ph] today and growing at the rate of 1 million documents per week. The application of AI reduces clinicians exhausted burden in finding related documents for care and reimbursement workflows, ultimately leading to practice efficiencies and better patient care. This is just one example of many where we're using AI to power insights and deliver clinical and financial value to our stakeholders. We've been pleased with our progress to date as we work to develop and implement various AI technologies, and we remain committed to increased investment to further extend our leadership positions and deliver value to our partners and stakeholders."", 'Now, moving below the line, we anticipate interest expense to be approximately $220 million to $240 million, and income attributable to non-controlling interest to be in the range of $140 million to $160 million. We anticipate the full year effective tax rate will be in the range of approximately 18% to 20%. And as a reminder, the timing and amount of discrete tax items are difficult to predict and therefore we do not provide quarterly effective tax rate guidance. Turning now to cash flow and capital deployment, we anticipate free cash flow of approximately $4.8 billion to $5.2 billion. Our working capital metrics and result in free cash flow will vary from quarter-to-quarter and are impacted by timing, including the day of the week that marks the close of a quarter.', 'Our guidance reflects plans to repurchase approximately $2.8 billion of shares in fiscal 2025. As a result of this share repurchase activity, we estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding to be in the range of approximately $128 million to $130 million. The strength of our balance sheet and operating cash flows provides the financial flexibility to incrementally invest both organically and inorganically for growth as well as return capital to our shareholders. Wrapping up fiscal 2025 guidance, we anticipate revenue growth of 15% to 17% and operating profit growth of 9% to 14% as compared to the prior year. For fiscal 2025, we anticipate earnings per diluted share of $31.25 to $32.05, which represents growth of 14% to 17% as compared to fiscal 2024.', ""We expect earnings per share will be more heavily weighted towards the second half of the fiscal year. We also anticipate the first quarter to have the lowest contribution. As a reminder, we had a lower effective tax rate in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 due to a discrete tax item. In summary, we see strength and stability in the underlying fundamentals across our businesses. Our sustained financial performance over the past several years has been bolstered by the strength of our financial position and the consistent operating execution leading to compelling value creation for our customers, partners and shareholders. We're pleased with the strong fiscal 2024 performance and the fiscal 2025 outlook reflects our continued confidence in the operating profit growth momentum across all segments of the business, supplemented by the strength of our balance sheet and strong financial position."", 'McKesson is well positioned to deliver strong results as we successfully execute against our strategic and financial framework to drive long-term sustainable growth for all stakeholders.

Despite a slight decrease in total net revenues year-over-year, with a 3.1% drop for the three months and a 2.1% dip for the six months ended March 31, 2024, the company's net income showed a significant increase. Net income rose from $81,436 thousand to $119,021 thousand for the three months and from $153,838 thousand to $257,403 thousand for the six months, indicating a robust bottom line. The diluted net income per share also saw an increase from $1.34 to $2.00 for the three months and from $2.54 to $4.32 for the six months. These figures suggest that F5 Inc (NASDAQ:FFIV) is effectively managing its expenses and maximizing profitability, despite the challenging market conditions."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with FFIV.', ""Product Innovation and Software Revenue Growth: F5 Inc (NASDAQ:FFIV) continues to demonstrate its strength in product innovation, particularly in its software offerings. The company's software revenues have increased by 20.2% for the three months and 9.9% for the six months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same periods in the previous year. This growth is a testament to F5 Inc's ability to adapt to the evolving needs of the market, focusing on software solutions that are increasingly in demand. The shift towards software revenue is strategic, as it often brings higher margins and recurring revenue, which can lead to a more stable and predictable financial performance over time."", ""Strong Service Revenue: Another area where F5 Inc (NASDAQ:FFIV) excels is in its service revenue, which has seen a 5.1% increase for the three months and 6.3% for the six months ended March 31, 2024. This growth is primarily due to the renewal of maintenance contracts and the realization of price increases from prior periods. The company's ability to maintain and grow its service revenue stream highlights the value customers find in F5 Inc's offerings, ensuring a steady cash flow and reinforcing the company's financial stability."", ""Decline in System Sales: F5 Inc (NASDAQ:FFIV) has experienced an 11.9% decrease in system sales for the three months and an 11.0% decrease for the six months ended March 31, 2024. This decline indicates a potential weakness in the company's ability to sell its hardware-based products. As customers increasingly move towards cloud-based solutions, the demand for traditional hardware systems may continue to wane, which could impact F5 Inc's revenue and market position if not addressed with a strategic pivot towards more software and cloud offerings."", ""Macroeconomic Sensitivity: The company's performance is subject to macroeconomic conditions, which have led to uncertainties in customer purchase decisions. The current economic climate, characterized by inflation and higher interest rates, could lead to tighter budgets and delayed spending among F5 Inc's customer base. This sensitivity to economic factors could pose a risk to the company's revenue growth and necessitate a more agile and resilient business strategy to navigate potential downturns."", 'Cloud and SaaS Market Expansion: F5 Inc (NASDAQ:FFIV) is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for cloud-based and SaaS solutions. With its existing suite of cloud services and ongoing product development, the company has the opportunity to expand its market share in this segment. By leveraging its expertise in application security and delivery, F5 Inc can offer differentiated services that cater to the needs of businesses transitioning to the cloud, thus opening new revenue streams and strengthening its competitive edge.', ""Strategic Acquisitions: F5 Inc (NASDAQ:FFIV) has a history of strategic acquisitions, such as the purchase of Lilac Cloud, Inc., which have bolstered its product offerings and technological capabilities. The company's strong balance sheet and cash flow provide it with the financial flexibility to pursue further acquisitions that align with its strategic objectives. These acquisitions can accelerate F5 Inc's growth, enhance its product portfolio, and enable it to enter new markets or consolidate its position in existing ones."", 'Competitive Pressure: F5 Inc (NASDAQ:FFIV) operates in a highly competitive industry, where rapid technological advancements and changing customer preferences can quickly alter the competitive landscape. The company must continuously innovate and adapt to maintain its market position against competitors who may offer similar or more advanced solutions. Failure to keep pace with industry trends could result in loss of market share and revenue.', ""Regulatory and Compliance Risks: As a global entity, F5 Inc (NASDAQ:FFIV) is subject to various regulatory environments and compliance requirements. Changes in regulations, particularly those related to data privacy and cybersecurity, could impose additional costs or constraints on the company's operations. F5 Inc must remain vigilant and proactive in its compliance efforts to avoid potential fines, legal challenges, or damage to its reputation."", ""In conclusion, F5 Inc (NASDAQ:FFIV) exhibits a strong financial foundation with growing software revenues and service offerings, despite facing challenges in system sales and macroeconomic uncertainties.

Thus far, Congress has balked on continuing to fund the program or find room for it in the federal budget. If the subsidy were to go away, some 23 million households would either not pay their bills or pay only a portion to their current broadband provider, creating a big risk for those providers.', 'But late Tuesday, a bipartisan group of six Senators introduced an amendment that would attach the ACP to the FAA Reauthorization Act, which must be passed at some point.', 'Notably, the amendment is a modified form of the ACP bill that was shot down earlier this year. It shrinks the subsidy by about $1 billion from $7 billion to $6 billion, lowering the wage threshold for subsidy qualification while also implementing measures meant to curb waste and abuse.', 'On their recent conference calls, Charter, Comcast, and Shenandoah all referred to the expiration of the ACP as a potential risk for elevated churn in the upcoming second and third quarters. Charter noted it had 5 million ACP customers out of its roughly 30 million (or 17%) residential relationships. Comcast has about 1.4 million ACP recipients out of about 31.6 (4.4%) million residential customers.\xa0And Shenandoah said it had less ACP exposure than large players, at less than 4% of its customer base.', ""Therefore, should the program be revived, that would be a relief to all these companies' financials. It's a bit curious that Shenandoah is up much more than the others, given its lower proportion of ACP customers. But Shenandoah is a much smaller company at just a $900 million market cap, and positive or negative news tends to have an outsized effect on smaller-cap companies. Shenandoah had also seen its stock essentially cut in half in just the past five months or so. So, it was perhaps due for a bounce on any good news."", 'Value investors may be looking toward the cable and telecom industry right now, as many players have seen their stocks sink to low valuations amid higher interest rates. However, broadband companies are still risky.', 'They are capital intensive, often dependent on government subsidies for a portion of their customer base, as we see today, and competition appears to be intensifying from both 5G wireless and new-age high-speed fiber builds. Meanwhile, the industry is largely saturated, and the cable bundle is in decline. Therefore, these companies are largely dependent on annual broadband price increases, which is becoming increasingly more difficult.', 'So, while these companies are enjoying the positive news today, investors may want to assess the outstanding risks before diving in.', 'Before you buy stock in Comcast, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Comcast wasn’t one of them.

Amid privacy challenges, threats to popular platforms and the impact of artificial intelligence (AI), digital ad spend is still expected to grow about 10% in both 2024 and 2025, led by continued growth in retail media and connected TV (CTV), according to a recent report by Advertiser Perceptions.', 'As advertisers shift their spend to those two channels, legacy media conglomerates and retailers with media networks of their own continue yearslong efforts to connect content and commerce.

Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Devon Energy's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story."", ""Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences.

However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.', 'Our information suggests that Devon Energy Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$222m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.

During the first quarter of 2020 for Japan generated strong financial results and importantly, advanced strategic initiatives we laid out on our last call. In late February, our strategies continued to perform well, generating strong and consistent returns for our LPs and we raised nearly 670 million in gross new fee-paying AUM in this quarter alone with Q1 marking my first full quarter as CEO, I can say with conviction we are building a world-class platform that provides clients with unrivaled access to opportunities across the Lower and core middle market. On our call today, I'm going to provide an overview of our first quarter financial results offer some perspectives on the market environment and discuss the operational progress we've made this year. I'll start by providing a brief financial overview. The 10 delivered record revenues of 66 million in the first quarter, representing solid 15% top line growth year over year. Additionally, we enhanced our bottom line performance, earning $5 million net income compared to $800,000 in the prior year period. As we mentioned on our last call, one of the key pillars of our new strategy is greater transparency as such, we believe it is important to introduce new metrics that allow the investment community to more easily compare us to other alternative asset managers. To that end, we delivered fee related revenue or FRR. $65 million, a 16% increase compared to the prior year period. And we generated approximately 31 million of fee-related earnings or FRE, a 9% increase from Q1 2023. This represents an FRE margin of 47%. We continue to anticipate margin to remain in the mid 40s for the year ahead which puts this performance slightly ahead of annual expectations. We are pleased with our ability to generate strong results as we implement transformative strategic initiatives. It seek to accelerate growth in the near to medium term. Our first quarter performance gives us the confidence to reiterate guidance we laid out on our fourth quarter call. As a reminder, we expect to organically raise and deploy more than 2.5 billion of gross new assets. We expect double digit revenue growth. That is driven both by this fundraising activity as well as positive fee rate dynamics and we expect to announce a strategic transaction in the calendar year. Zooming out slightly. Japan continues to benefit from a focus on the lower and core middle markets as we have said previously, these markets have been insulated from some of the macro dynamics at the upper middle market levels, such as a meaningfully slower M&A environment, greater reliance on leverage and a more competitive backdrop for deals. In our view, the lower and core middle markets offer risk mitigation from these trends and have equally shown sustained resilience despite the current rate environment and inflationary pressures. Further, our strategies have an exceptional track record of delivering returns across economic cycles. Our GPs are strong fundraisers and even better portfolio managers, whether it's through launching and optimizing industry-leading products. We're forging strategic relationships with underlying portfolio companies. Our strategies have established a differentiated reputation with clients, investment managers and intermediaries. Key trends managers have earned trust at every level of the investment value chain and mistrust underpins the strategic initiatives that we laid out on our last call today, I want to share some of the progress we've made in driving organic growth initiatives, establishing a robust M&A pipeline and institutionalizing our platform for the long term. First, we are making strides to drive organic growth. We see a clear and compelling opportunity to deepen and expand our already robust client franchise. In the first quarter, we had 10 co-mingled funds in the market, providing multiple avenues to meet the particular investment objectives of clients and achieve our organic growth goals. I wanted to take a moment to share some of the momentum we are producing on the fundraising front in the first quarter, our VC strategy TruBridge achieved its $750 million target in funding today. The fund is on pace to hold the final close in the second quarter at a total fund size in excess of 850 million in private credit Park four has now achieved over $500 million, surpassing its target and putting it on track to hold the final close in the second quarter. Staying in credit WTI. is positioned to turn on fees for its fund 11 in the second half of the year, and we are seeing strong interest around its portfolio, moving to private equity on accord. We'll hold the final close of BCP fund to later in this year, and we will look to launch BCP Fund three in short succession. Finally, we expect to launch our CP. direct fund five in the coming weeks. Further, RCP is on track to launch SOF. five a secondary fund in late 2024, which will set the stage for strong momentum in 2025. These funds have historically garnered a strong following from LPs, not only for their performance, but because of the demand for these solutions in the market today, we are pleased with the totality of our fundraising efforts, which have resulted in a gross raise of approximately 670 million in the first quarter. Our organic growth will always be enabled by our core strategies, and these fundraising levels demonstrate the diversity of demand from our client base. Moving now to our inorganic growth strategy. On our last call, we announced the appointment of RJ. Jensen to our leadership team as Head of Strategy and M&A. Since then RJ has been hard at work, developing our M&A infrastructure, leading the charge for us on situations that we are working to advance as well as doing the work on opportunities we are seeing in the market. I want to provide a few high-level observations about the level of activity we are seeing. First, I would say the M&A market and the alternative asset management sector has picked up. You see that in the announcements in the marketplace generally, and we see it in the number of opportunities we see directly the pipeline. We have developed the date is reasonably balanced between private equity credit and distribution oriented opportunities. These are investments that we believe are actionable in the near term and represent a diverse mix from a geographic standpoint across both domestic and international deals. Throughout all our dialogue around prospective transactions, we have received positive feedback from potential partners who find the P. business model and our transaction framework to be differentiating and compelling. We anticipate announcing a deal this year. And I also think it is most likely that near term successes will be more String of Pearls in nature. We continue to think that geographic expansion where we have larger strategies as well as smaller natural adjacencies and potential tuck-ins would make sense. Additionally, we are focused on situations that have an interesting distribution component to them. Please note that we will be disciplined around valuation, seeking accretive opportunities positioned to unlock long-term value for our shareholders. Turning now to our focus on optimizing our corporate level organizational structure. As you can see with the traction, RJ has already achieved. Our efforts to institutionalize the PBM platform are taking hold since our last call, we have made several key appointments, enhanced our governance profile and set ourselves up to conclude our search for senior-level talent in the first half of the year. In April, we appointed Tracy Bedford to the Board as an independent director who will participate in all three of our governance committees. Tracy is a remarkable leader with deep alternative asset expertise and experienced stewarding iconic institutions in the financial sector. She brings an independent diverse perspective to our Board. Robert Alpert informed the Board of Directors of his decision to step down as Executive Chairman effective June 14. The date of our annual meeting this time as Executive Chairman, was intended to help me and our senior team effective successful leadership transition, and he now feels that transition is complete. We will continue to serve on the Board as a Director. The Board voted to appoint me to the role of Chairman, also effective June 14th and intends to appoint a lead independent director at our annual meeting. I want to thank Robert for his time as Executive Chairman and his leadership since founding T. 10. I look forward to continuing to work with him on the Board. The Board also determined that the company's stockholder rights plan is no longer necessary for the preservation of federal income tax benefits and voted to terminate the rights plan effective today, the plan was set to expire in October of 2024. In parallel, we are augmenting our management team for future growth to that end I am pleased to report that we brought on Melody Kraft as General Counsel to bolster our senior leadership team. Ability has an impressive long-standing track record as a leader in the financial services sector with alternative asset management expertise and deep experience leading M&A transactions through requisite legal processes and post-close integration activities. Her experience perfectly aligns with our operational goals and will be beneficial to deepen as we embark on our next chapter of growth. While we remain in the early innings of these strategic initiatives, we've been extremely pleased with the partnership we're seeing across strategies and managers. There is immense opportunity in our existing platform, and we look forward to sharing specific examples in the coming quarters. I'll close with an update on our efforts to return value to shareholders through capital allocation. Last quarter, we shared that we had a total share repurchase authorization of over 50 million in the first quarter. We bought back about 3.7 million shares at an average price of $8.15 per share. We currently have approximately $21 million remaining on our authorization. Additionally, we continue to pay quarterly cash dividends to shareholders declaring a $0.035 distribution today, which represents an 8% increase. Our annual dividend now stands at $0.14 per share as a reminder, the 10 employees make up the largest ownership position in our shareholder register, which is indicative of our collective conviction in the intrinsic value of our business. This ownership stake demonstrates our alignment with the broader shareholder base and should underscore our dissatisfaction with the current valuation pressure we face in the public market. We have been opportunistic in repurchasing shares of our stock and believe that the current trading levels present a compelling entry point for investors. As our strategy continues to gain momentum, the growth profile of P10 expands and accelerates. We believe the market will appreciate this potential in due time. Fundamentals of our business remain exceptionally strong. We have the right strategy in place to deliver long-term value to shareholders. Before I turn the call over to Amanda, I want to take a moment to invite you all to mark your calendars for our inaugural Investor Day, which will be held on Thursday, September 19th in New York City. The day will serve as a deep dive on our various strategies, and we will offer more details on our strategic progress to date. We look forward to sharing more details as the event approaches. With that, I'll hand the call over to Amanda."", 'Amanda Coussens', ""Thank you, Luke. Eaton continues to deliver strong results amidst implementing the transformative strategic initiatives the management team laid out on the first-quarter earnings call. In the first quarter, fee-paying assets under management were 23.8 billion, a 10% increase on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter, $667 million of fundraising and capital deployment was offset by 81 million and step-downs and expirations. As we mentioned on the Q4 call, we expect step-downs and expirations for 2024 to be approximately 1.5 billion, 200 million less than 2023. Most of the step-downs and expirations will occur in Q2, where we expect 1 billion, leaving $400 million generally evenly split across the third and fourth quarters. Most of the second quarter step-downs and expirations are expected to be attributable to our CP. Fund nine, a 2014 vintage and TruBridge fund to a 2010 vintage record. Revenue in the first quarter was $66.1 million, a 15% increase over the first quarter of 2023. Average fee rate in the first quarter was 110 basis points, driven by higher fee rate direct strategies becoming a larger part of our fee-paying AUM as well as higher catch-up fees. Turning now to our strategies. In the quarter, we had 10 funds in the market and saw broad participation across our investment platform. Our private equity strategies raised and deployed $213 million. Our venture solution raised and deployed $339 million on our credit strategies added 99 million to fee-paying assets under management of note, in the quarter, TruBridge eight raised $233 million. Dpm continues to benefit from strategies with long track records of generating durable alpha and offering best in class investment opportunities to our global clients. Catch-up fees were 7.7 million in the first quarter. Operating expenses in the first quarter were $54 million, a 3% increase over the same period a year ago. The increase was primarily driven by additional compensation benefits and non-cash stock-based compensation expense related to the acquisitions of BioAccord Park and WTI. GAAP net income in the first quarter was 5.2 million, an increase compared to 800,000 in the comparable period a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was $30.8 million, an increase of 9% from the first quarter of 2023. For the quarter, our adjusted EBITDA margin was 47% for the first quarter. Adjusted net income or ANI held flat at $25.4 million when compared to the first quarter of 2023. Fully diluted ANI EPS remained at $0.21 per share on a year-over-year basis. As Luke noted, we have added transparency in the quarter and are introducing the following metrics fee-related revenue or FRR. fee-related earnings or SRE. and complementary FRE. margin FRR. in the quarter was 65 million, representing a 16% annual increase and FRE was $30.7 million, representing a 9% increase. Our FRE margin was 47% in the first quarter. Since this is the first time we have reported these metrics, I want to provide more information on how we define each turn. The related revenue is calculated as total revenue less any incentive fees. Fee-related earnings is a non-GAAP performance measure used to monitor our baseline earnings like any incentive fee revenue and excluding any incentive fee related expenses we believe this additional disclosure will help the investment community drive better apples to apples comparisons. With the broader alternative asset management landscape. You can find additional details and definitions in our earnings presentation on our Investor Relations website. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the first quarter were $29 million. At quarter end, we had an outstanding debt balance of $316 million and 45 million available on the revolver. As of today, we have an outstanding debt balance of 298,000,063 million available on the revolver. We also continue to pay our quarterly dividend for Class A. and Class B common stock. As Nick mentioned, we are increasing our dividend by 8%. Today, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.035 per share payable on June 20th, 2024 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 31st, 2024. Finally, as of March 31, 2024, our Class A. shares outstanding were 54,526,000 or 98 and Class B shares outstanding were 58,439,363. Before I close, I'd like to highlight that next week we expect to file our required registration statement, the registered shares owned by founders and insiders. These shares were part of the shares issued during the IPO process. We want to be clear, the company is not selling shares to raise capital with over 3 million shares purchased last quarter. We think management's view on the stock's intrinsic value is clear. Thank you for your time today. We look forward to building strong momentum in 2024 as we seek to accelerate growth in 2025. I'll now pass the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Kenneth Worthington of JPMorgan.', 'Kenneth Worthington', ""Hi, this is Art Bernstein on for Ken. Thanks so much for taking my question and congratulations on the quarter. Just done knows that this quarter, if you remove the impact of catch-up fees, looks like we're seeing a nine handle on the fee rate for the first time in at least a while. Just wanted to double-click on that and see if you have any explanations around what drove that, how we could think about the fee rate moving forward from an execution perspective and then also what the framework is more broadly appreciated."", 'Amanda Coussens', ""I'm proud yet, and we have started seeing the impact revenue of the step-down that we mentioned, the step-downs and expirations that we mentioned that will occur in the second quarter. And this does not change our annual guidance of 105 basis points for the year, though, guys appreciate."", 'Kenneth Worthington', ""And maybe to ask the second question, this time speaking more broadly, you spoke about the robust M&A opportunities. And you also pointed to distribution having had the benefit of seeing a number of your larger peers report. Now there's definitely some specific areas from a distribution perspective that a lot of folks are after namely insurance and retail come to mind. I noticed you did disclose on some of your current AUM makeup and something like insurance is not really a large part of it. Is that more a factor of the size of the market and into markets you plan? And is that an area that you potentially look to target on via M&A or otherwise? Appreciate it."", 'Luke Sarsfield', ""Thanks, Alex. Great question. And I would say a few things we do disclose, as you can see, kind of every quarter are kind of LP distribution by channel type, and it's generally remained pretty consistent across the cycle. I'd say a few things. Number one, I think we do have to your question on retail. I do think retail broadly defined is a really big opportunity. And when you look at where we are in terms of family offices, wealth managers, we think we have meaningful penetration in that channel and meaningful momentum in that channel. To your question on insurance, I think you're exactly right. It is a question of product mix. And I think increasingly, though we do have products that are very relevant for the insurance channel. I would note Hark, for instance, as a product offering in the NAB lending space that's incredibly relevant for insurance, and we've actually seen some very, very nice momentum of late in terms of real traction with Park in that channel. Remember, Park is focused on deploying the way we recognize revenues on deployed capital, not on committed capital. So it takes a little longer to come through the come through the P&L. But I think insurance is a real opportunity for us with our broad range of credit offerings, in particular with heart, and it's a place that we're incredibly focused on increasing our footprint."", 'Kenneth Worthington', 'Appreciate the answer. Thanks again.', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Benjamin Budish, Barclays.', 'Benjamin Budish', ""Book holidays there I was I had it on mute on. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the fundraising trajectory for the year. It looked like in Q1, you raised a little over 25% of the full year target. And I know it's 2.5 billion plus or more than 2.5 billion. So I was wondering if you any other color on Q1 tends to be seasonally slow or that sort of what we heard. We've heard from some of the other publicly traded alts. You guys are a bit different in that you have many, many funds in the market that come come back frequently rather than every four years. So just wondering, you talked about some of the upcoming closes but how does the nearly 700 million this quarter compared to what you expect in the next several quarters? Any help you can give us around like what the plus might mean on would be helpful. Thank you."", 'Luke Sarsfield', ""Thanks, Ben. I don't want I want to be a little careful here because I don't want to get into kind of giving quarterly guidance but I'll say a few things. Number one, we've talked about how we had 10 funds in the market in the first quarter. And I think we referenced last time that we thought we would have 15 funds in the market over the course of the year. So obviously that we will have more funds in the market as we go into the meat of the year in the back half of the year. The second thing I would note is some of the great momentum we're seeing. I mentioned the momentum we're seeing in terms of TruBridge in terms of Park, we have some very big closes coming up with some of our strategies at later this year, notably upon Accor. And then as I mentioned, a number of funds that are going to be launched at our CP., I would say the following. I think like to your point, and I do think we are seeing increasing momentum generally in terms of our dialogue with the broad swath of LPs. And I think people even in light of some of the macro pressures are clearly starting to lean in a little bit more, and that feels good. And so as I said, we're really pleased with the first quarter activity. We think we have really strong momentum. And again, we're reiterating the guidance that we think we will organically raise and deploy more than 2.5 billion of gross new assets this year. We feel very good about that."", 'Benjamin Budish', ""Appreciate that maybe one more question on capital allocation. So you bought back a lot of stock in the quarter. And based on the share price performance, it's not surprising why, especially based on what you've indicated is your conviction in the business. Just any color on what would it take to raise the repurchase authorization? Is that something that could happen quickly? What's your appetite to continue repurchasing shares. And then on the dividend side, can you just remind us I can't remember if you've communicated in the past, but any sort of higher-level philosophy around being like a regular dividend raise or having attractive FRE or anything like that on. Could you just remind us what you've communicated there in the past? Thank you."", 'Amanda Coussens', 'Yes, in terms of our in terms of our just general capital allocation, and we still have 20.5 million available on for the buyback. We did increase the dividend by about a penny per share which is at the same pace that we increased the dividend last year. So that likely speaks to our dividend, our overall policy speaking. And then in addition to the dividend, we really intend to allocate capital towards M&A. You know, I would expect with 20.5 million remaining on the buyback. That is that as part of our capital allocation policy or will continue to be a priority. And then the remainder will be paid down on the revolver to free up capital for future M&A. So I would say our capital allocation policy really has not changed. The priorities have not changed from from last quarter.', 'Luke Sarsfield', ""The only thing I would add is we need to have a lot of conviction around where we think assuming we execute on the plan and we are laser focused on executing where we think the share price ought to be. You see that in our insider ownership where we have substantial skin in the game. You see that in the $30 million roughly we deployed to share repurchase last quarter. And so we're obviously big fans of the shares right here and I think we'll, you know, we'll take that into account as part of an overall capital allocation philosophy."", 'Benjamin Budish', 'All right. Thanks for the responses.', 'Operator', 'Adam Beatty of UBS.', 'Adam Beatty', ""Thank you and good afternoon. I'm just wanted to get an update on the outlook for expense growth this year, maybe next year. I know Luke, you have a pretty clear idea around reinvesting in the business and then building for future growth. So just wanted to know if kind of the trajectory of expenses again for this year or next has changed at all and what you expect the cadence of that to be?"", 'Luke Sarsfield', 'Thank you, Adam.', 'Amanda Coussens', ""I'll take that question. And so I would say in general and we're confident in our ability to manage expenses while still delivering strong financial performance. And if you look at our operating expenses of $54 million, which was a 3% increase year over year compared to our record revenue of $64 million, which was a 15% increase year over year. And we believe our right hires will enhance financial performance incrementally and demonstrate the value that we are creating in terms of our overall margin, we do expect margins to average in the mid 40s, excluding the effect of acquisitions as we said in the prior quarter, this is an ongoing mix shift with our existing portfolio strategies. Some of our newer and faster-growing businesses such as Bon Accord Park and WTI. Kaba, lower core adjusted EBITDA margins and then other parts of our business as the overall margin will continue to reflect this evolution, I would say the second influence on margins is our critical and foundational human capital investments that we're making in the business. We expect the investments to drive core growth and provide a high ROI for our investors."", 'Luke Sarsfield', 'Okay. Sounds good.', 'Adam Beatty', ""And I appreciate the different ways of angling the margin, which is basically what I was after. And then turning to kind of the underlying investments and investment environment and maybe some of the look through to the portfolio companies. Mid-market obviously has some great opportunities for alpha generation. You have that good chart in there about how much capital is chasing larger companies versus versus mid-market. So clearly an opportunity there. But just wondering, you know, in uncertain times, sometimes folks are concerned about some mid-market companies kind of go from being more vulnerable as it were to the economic environment. So if there's any updates on maybe the kinds of revenue growth or under other fundamentals you're seeing across the portfolio that would be great."", 'Luke Sarsfield', ""Yes. Look, it's a great question and something we are focused on what I know you're right. The conventional wisdom is that there's wind when the large market sneezes, the mid-market catches a cold. Our lived experience is quite contrary to that, actually, and I think it's due to a number of things. Number one, as we noted in the dialogue, it's just a less competitive market environment. And we are one of the clear differentiated market leaders and I think that really gives us opportunity. The second is I would tell you, I think unlike in the large market opportunity where there are a large number of competitors and large pools of capital going after the opportunity set, it's simply more limited in the middle market and that provides, I would say, margin of safety to third is the reality of things like leverage utilization, leverage utilization is much, much higher in the upper part of the market and obviously in a rising rate environment that has real consequence, the leverage levels generally in our part of the market are much lower. And so even though rising rates will impact the overall interest expense on portfolio companies, they do so to a much smaller degree. And so when I think when we put that all together, the net effect is we continue to think the middle and lower middle market is an unbelievably attractive place to be. We continue to think it is insulated but not immune from some of the larger from some of the larger macro trends going on. And we think that emblematic of that has been our ability to generate generate differentiated investment alpha across the cycle."", 'Adam Beatty', ""That's good contacts. Thanks very much. Appreciate it."", 'Operator', 'Stephanie Moore of Morgan Stanley.', 'Stephanie Moore', ""Good afternoon. This is Stephanie on for Mike high-price. And I show our first question is for Luc. Now that you spend the first few months in the CEO seat and now with the expanded role, curious if you can just give us an update on the strategy and maybe reflect on some of the progress that you've made so far, what you've focused on in your first few months at 10 versus where you may be turning your attention to now."", 'Luke Sarsfield', ""Thanks, Stephanie, and that's a great question. I love talking about it. So as I mentioned, I came in with a real kind of strategic focus on doing a few things. The first was understanding the business. And as you recall on the fourth quarter call, I talked about how I really spent the tail end of 2023 out on a listening tour. Then you'll recall on the February call, we talked about kind of the five strategic pillars. And just to remind everybody, strategic pillar one was to institutionalize our platform and optimize our organizational structure. Pillar two was to drive increased organic growth through our client franchise and strategic partnerships. Pillar three was implementing a robust, disciplined and process-driven approach to M&A and inorganic growth. Pillar four was generating operational efficiencies through incentivizing collaboration and leveraging our data platform. And pillar five was enhancing our shareholder communications with an eye to greater visibility and accelerating growth and profitability in 2025 and beyond. I will tell you, and I think we started the call in this. I think in every instance we've made real progress against those, right. And so if you take the organic growth pillar, we talked about the fundraising environment and the momentum we're seeing with our funds. If you take the inorganic growth pillar, you heard me talk about the pipeline, the conversations and the fact that our model and our structure is resonating to a broad swath of potential partners. I mentioned, obviously, you've seen the press releases on the progress we made in terms of the leadership team, adding RJ Jensen to lead strategy and M&A, adding mobility craft as our great new GC and then some of the Board of moves that we talked about. And obviously, we'll continue to advance that. We continue to be very aggressively out in the market. Looking for a head of distribution and clients. We talked about some of the systems and processes, and we're doing a lot of work around data and analytical initiatives. I'm including AI. in terms of how we can drive greater data utilization and greater data insight. And then we talked about enhanced transparency. And as you've seen on this call, we introduced fee-related revenue fee-related earnings, FRE margins, we've given more detail in terms of fund level fundraising. And I think we're really, really focused on building that shareholder momentum through the investor day where we're going to continue to share even more. I would say my focus right now is a relentless focus on execution. We put the plan in place. We feel really good about the team we're building and now we've got to go execute and execute in a world-class way. And so we're really focused on that execution. We're really focused on accountability. We're really focused on tracking KPIs related to that execution. But if I had to give you one watchword, it would be execution."", 'Stephanie Moore', ""That's great. Thanks for that color. And then just maybe one more from us. Turning to the sea seems to be an area that's been out of favor and perhaps could be reinvigorated with the latest AI trends. So maybe you can just give us an update on your performance in the VC business? Does AI helps support that portfolio in any way? And maybe has investor appetite or demand evolved around that space lately? Thank you."", 'Luke Sarsfield', ""Great question. I'd say a few things. Number one, I think you'll recall, I noted that we'd actually seen real momentum in our core fund raising around TruBridge and their core fund. Obviously, that's our marquee venture capital strategy. I think it's emblematic of a few things. Number one is their consistent track record of investment and alpha generation that's really profound across cycles across markets. Number two is the fact that they really are an access constrained strategy with access to really top top world-class managers that I think many find very hard to access outside of TruBridge, and we can provide that access. And I think venture is a place where if you look at and kind of dispersion of returns, there's it's not an 80 20 rule, it's like a 95 five rule in venture. And the good news is we're on the right side of that. And then I would say the last thing is we've always been great believers in data and analytics across our platform. Clearly, we're seeing the AI trend on both accelerating the investing landscape for a lot of venture managers, but as I mentioned, we're trying to use data and ultimately artificial intelligence to gain greater insights into our business and our investing capabilities into our portfolio management capabilities into our dealings with a lot of our LPs and clients. And so that's going to pervade our business in every way. But I would tell you personally, I'm incredibly excited about the opportunities and venture I think coming off what was the last cycle and now going into a new new cycle of growth and opportunity, we're really excited about that franchise."", 'Stephanie Moore', 'Great. Thanks again.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back to Luke Sarsfield for closing remarks. Sir?', 'Luke Sarsfield', ""Thank you, and thanks all of you for joining us today.

Meanwhile, 100% of all advanced chips are developed overseas, mostly by TSMC (TSM) in Taiwan.', 'That reality and fear of a supply disruption prompted the Biden administration to pass the $50 billion CHIPS Act in 2022, aimed at bringing manufacturing back to the US. The incentives included in that package have attracted nearly half a trillion dollars in investments to build fabrication facilities in the US, according to Neuffer.', 'Intel, which has received $8.5 billion in federal grants, has been the biggest beneficiary. The company has invested more than $100 billion to expand manufacturing operations in Arizona, New Mexico, and Oregon.', '“[The CHIPS Act] has leveled the playing field when it comes to companies deciding where to put the next fab,” Neuffer said.', 'US subsidies have set off a type of global race to incentivize chip manufacturing. Europe is attempting to attract fab development with its own $47 billion package. Japan has pushed to reclaim its position as a semiconductor powerhouse by extending $17.5 billion in grants to industry leaders, including TSMC and Micron (MU). And China, largely limited by US export controls, has looked to build out its own chipmaking capabilities with more than $150 billion in investments.', 'Furthermore, the SIA estimates that private investments in wafer fabrication will total $2.3 trillion by 2032.', 'Neuffer said the scale of investments made since 2022 has put the US in a stronger position to compete for advanced chip manufacturing, with the country set to capture 28% of the market for chips below 10 nanometers by 2032. A smaller nanometer size indicates a more powerful chip.', 'However, oversupply remains a concern, particularly for processors that are most widely used in devices like smartphones and consumer electronics.', 'The SIA report said the trajectory of current fabrication plant construction puts the capacity of future demand for ""legacy"" chips that are 28 nanometers and above “substantially in excess of future demand,” particularly in China, leading to price decreases.', 'A shortage of workers to fill new fabrication facilities is also a concern. TSMC cited an “insufficient amount of skilled workers” when it announced a delay in its Arizona facility last summer, saying it would need to send technicians from Taiwan to train its US workforce. In December, the company agreed to develop a workforce training program to resolve a labor dispute there.', 'Neuffer said the semiconductor industry faces a projected shortfall of 67,000 workers this decade, particularly with a lack of engineers, computer scientists, and technicians. He said more training programs and STEM course development are needed to support an industry whose workforce is expected to grow by nearly 115,000 jobs in that time period.', ""“It's going to take a lot of people to fill these fabs up,” he said. “This is an issue we are focused like a laser on, but it's going to take public support as well in the universities and the community colleges.”"", 'Akiko Fujita is an anchor and reporter for Yahoo Finance.

GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with MCD.', ""On May 8, 2024, McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) released its 10-Q filing, revealing a comprehensive financial performance for the first quarter of the year. The company, known for its global dominance in the fast-food industry, reported a notable increase in total revenues from $5,898 million in 2023 to $6,169 million in 2024, a 4.6% year-over-year growth. This financial upswing is further evidenced by a 7% rise in net income, climbing from $1,802 million to $1,929 million. The earnings per share (EPS) also saw an uptick, with basic EPS rising from $2.47 to $2.67 and diluted EPS from $2.45 to $2.66. These figures underscore McDonald's Corp's financial resilience and its ability to maintain profitability amidst a dynamic market landscape."", 'Global Brand and Market Presence: McDonald\'s Corp (NYSE:MCD) continues to leverage its iconic brand, which is synonymous with fast-food across the globe. The company\'s brand strength is a critical asset, contributing to its $130 billion in system sales across nearly 42,000 stores. The brand\'s widespread recognition facilitates customer loyalty and consistent traffic, a testament to its enduring appeal and marketing prowess. McDonald\'s strategic marketing initiatives, such as ""Feel-Good Marketing,"" resonate with customers worldwide, reinforcing the brand\'s relevance and emotional connection.', ""Franchising Model Efficiency: McDonald's Corp's franchising model is a cornerstone of its financial strength. Approximately 60% of its revenue stems from franchise royalty fees and lease payments, a testament to the model's success. This structure not only minimizes operational risks but also ensures a stable and predictable revenue stream. The company's strategic co-investments with franchisees in restaurant improvements and operating systems further enhance the brand's value and drive performance across the franchise network."", ""Dependence on Franchisees: While McDonald's Corp's franchising model is a strength, it also presents a vulnerability. The company's performance is heavily reliant on its franchisees' success, which can be influenced by various factors beyond corporate control, such as local market conditions and management effectiveness. Any misalignment or inconsistency in operations among franchisees could potentially tarnish the brand's reputation and impact overall performance."", ""Market Saturation Risks: McDonald's Corp operates in a highly competitive and mature market, where growth opportunities may be limited by market saturation. As the company seeks to expand its global footprint, it may encounter challenges in finding new markets or increasing market share in existing ones without cannibalizing sales from current locations. This saturation also intensifies competition, putting pressure on McDonald's to continuously innovate and differentiate its offerings to maintain its market position."", ""Digital Innovation and Customer Engagement: McDonald's Corp has identified digital innovation as a key driver for future growth. The company's investments in digital platforms, including mobile ordering, loyalty programs, and personalized marketing, are designed to enhance customer engagement and convenience. By expanding its digital capabilities, McDonald's aims to attract a younger demographic and create a more seamless customer experience, which could lead to increased sales and customer loyalty."", ""Global Expansion and New Markets: Despite the challenges of market saturation, McDonald's Corp sees significant growth potential in international markets. The company's plans to open more than 2,100 new restaurants in 2024 reflect its ambition to tap into emerging markets and capitalize on global urbanization trends. By strategically entering new territories and optimizing its restaurant footprint, McDonald's can continue to expand its global presence and drive systemwide sales growth."", ""Macroeconomic and Geopolitical Uncertainties: McDonald's Corp operates in a complex global environment where macroeconomic and geopolitical factors can significantly impact its business. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates, trade policies, and political instability in key markets can affect the company's profitability and operational efficiency. The ongoing war in the Middle East, for instance, has already had a slight negative impact on the International Developmental Licensed Markets segment's comparable sales."", ""Changing Consumer Preferences and Health Trends: As consumer preferences evolve, particularly towards healthier and more sustainable options, McDonald's Corp must adapt its menu offerings to stay relevant. The fast-food industry faces increasing scrutiny over nutritional content, sourcing practices, and environmental impact. McDonald's needs to continuously innovate its menu and supply chain practices to meet these changing demands and mitigate the risk of losing market share to competitors who may be quicker to respond to such trends."", ""In conclusion, McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) demonstrates a strong financial and strategic position in its latest SEC 10-Q filing. The company's robust brand, efficient franchising model, and strategic investments in digital innovation position it well for continued success. However, reliance on franchisees, market saturation, macroeconomic uncertainties, and evolving consumer preferences present ongoing challenges. By leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses, McDonald's can capitalize on opportunities and navigate threats, ensuring its place as a leader in the global fast-food industry."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Growing dividends for half a century demands significant dedication and financial stability. Hence, only 54 out of 4,000 publicly traded companies in the US have managed to accomplish this feat of sustained dividend growth. Moreover, these companies have raised and maintained their dividends despite enduring seven recessions over the past five decades, including the Black Monday in 1987, the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, and the Coronavirus Crash of 2020. The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) are some of the best dividend kings with decades-long dividend growth streaks.', 'Companies that have the ability to raise their dividends have shown resilience and stability over time. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks the performance of companies with 25 or more consecutive years of dividend growth, has outperformed the S&P 500 since its inception in 2005. According to a report by ProShares, the initial investment of $10,000 made in 2005 in the index could have potentially grown to over $61,000 by March 2021. Moreover, the index has surpassed the broader market in performance during eight out of the ten most significant quarterly downturns since 2005. The report also mentioned that the companies in the Dividend Aristocrats Index have grown their dividends at an annual average rate of 8.3% between 2005 and 2022, compared with a 6.7% annual average dividend growth rate of the S&P 500 companies.', 'Investors have been actively seeking dividend growth stocks because of their capacity to provide consistent and increasing income over time. As corporate balance sheets are showing strength, many companies in the US are steadily growing their dividends. According to the latest data from S&P Dow Jones Indices, the companies in the S&P 500 distributed $151.6 billion in dividends in the first quarter of 2024, up from $146.8 billion during the same period last year. The report further mentioned that total dividend increases were $22.7 billion for the quarter, compared with $19.7 billion in the first quarter of 2023. Howard Silverblatt, Senior Index Analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, has given a strong outlook for dividend growth this year, especially for large-cap companies. Here is what he said:', '“Absent an economic or geopolitical event, dividend growth is expected to selectively continue. S&P 500 large caps appear to be weathering uncertainty and volatility better. The index is expected to post a 6% increase in payments for 2024 compared to its 5.1% increase in 2023 and the 10.8% increase seen in 2022.""', ""Generating income from dividend stocks is not a quick process; it mainly requires patience and a long-term investment approach. Dividend stocks are ideal for long-term investors as these equities have outpaced inflation over the years. Morningstar cited data from Yale University's Robert Shiller and revealed that since 1871, dividends per share in the S&P 500 have increased at an annualized rate of 1.6 percentage points faster than inflation. In addition to this, the advantage of dividend growth over inflation has strengthened in recent years. Over the past 50 years, dividends have surpassed inflation by an annualized rate of 2.5 percentage points, and over the last 20 years, by 4.6 percentage points annually."", 'That said, achieving dividend growth and that too, for such long periods of time, is not an easy task.

Firstly, the geopolitical Middle East situation has caused supply chain disruption from war and ensuing inflation, but most significantly has resulted in a boycott by many consumers in the region.”', 'Amid debate on the effectiveness of boycotts, Cleland points out that the strong sentiment around the war is shared by the majority of consumers. According to GlobalData’s 2023 Q2 global consumer survey, 69% of consumers in the Middle East or Africa somewhat or strongly agree that they will boycott a brand which doesn’t align with their values or beliefs.', ""When asked about the impact of protests on international trade, McDonald's Kempczinski said: “If you look at the impact of some of the boycotts in a few of our markets, I wouldn’t say that things are getting any worse there.”"", 'He continued: “We’re not expecting to see any meaningful improvement in the impact until the war is over, and we continue to have that outlook with what the Middle East conflict is going to do to our trend.”', ""In a LinkedIn post in January, Kempczinski wrote that McDonald's was seeing a “meaningful” hit to business, blaming “misinformation that is affecting brands like McDonald’s”."", ""His comments were in response to consumer boycotts, sparked by McDonald's provision of thousands of free meals to IDF soldiers in the days after October 7 and escalated when the pro-Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS), officially called for a boycott of the brand in January. The prompted owners of franchises in Muslim-majority countries including Kuwait, Malaysia and Pakistan to put out statements distancing themselves."", 'In April, McDonald’s announced that it would buy back its 225 franchise restaurants in Israel from local owners.', 'Cleland believes that boycotting has had an impact, noting that Starbucks – which is also being boycotted – experienced a weak Q1 too.', '“The risk for McDonalds is that other consumers may see the impact of boycotts and follow suit,” he said. “In this more volatile era of cancel culture, brands will have to pre-empt events, potentially requiring specific roles in corporate structures to manage this issue, as has been done in recent years for ESG issues.”', 'McDonald’s earnings call included little discussion of the Middle East. Instead, Kempczinski focused on the budget constraints faced by many customers. He noted that “consumers continue to be even more discriminating with every dollar that they spend as they face elevated prices in their day-to-day spending, which is putting pressure on the QSR industry.”', 'According to GlobalData analysis, there has been a shift in purchasing habits as consumers tighten their belts. The 2024 Q1 global consumer survey found that 64% of consumers reported that they had either stopped eating out at restaurants, never had, or were doing so less frequently; 65% said the same about takeaways.', 'The point was echoed by McDonald’s executive vice president and chief financial officer Ian Borden, who also spoke on the post-earnings call. He also considered the financial pressures faced by consumers to be the reason behind a drop in growth.', 'He told investors: “As customers continue to be more intentional with the dollars that they spend in a pressured economic landscape, we expect moderated topline growth this year.”', '""Why did McDonald’s miss its profit estimates – and can other brands learn?"" was originally created and published by Retail Insight Network, a GlobalData owned brand.', '', '\xa0', 'The information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference will be recorded, May 8.I would now like to turn the call over to Clare Adams, Senior Manager, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.', 'Clare Adams', ""Good morning. Before we begin, we'd like to remind everyone that this call includes certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in the most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed by Liberty Broadband and Liberty TripAdvisor with the SEC. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this call, and Liberty Broadband and Liberty TripAdvisor expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in Liberty Broadband or Liberty TripAdvisor's expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.On today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures for Liberty Broadband, including adjusted OIBDA. Information regarding the comparable GAAP metrics, along with the required definitions and reconciliations, including preliminary notes in Schedules 1 and 2, can be found in the earnings press release issued today as well as earnings releases for prior periods, which are available on Liberty Broadband's website.Now I'd like to introduce Greg Maffei, Liberty's President and CEO."", 'Gregory B. Maffei', ""Thank you, Clare, and good morning to all. Today speaking on the call, we will have Liberty Broadband's Chief Accounting and Principal Financial Officer, Brian Wendling; Ron Duncan, CEO of GCI; and Pete Pounds, CFO of GCI, will also be available to answer questions. Also during Q&A, we will be available to answer questions related to Liberty TripAdvisor.So beginning with Liberty Broadband. Similar to last year, early in the year, we remain under the 26% fully diluted ownership cap, largely due to Charter's annual compensation grants. We do expect to resume sales into Charter's buyback this summer, and we also expect that the majority of proceeds, which have historically gone to LBRD purchases will continue somewhere going in the future and we will evaluate the best uses we receive proceeds. But I do expect in the near term, we will have a greater focus on debt reduction. So you might see some of us have a reduced pace of buyback in the near term.Looking at Charter itself, Internet adds have been challenged across the industry with lower growth across the board in the first quarter. Charter experienced a 72,000 subscriber net loss, largely from continued elevated competition, early headwinds from the upcoming ACP expiration and reduce move activity given, among other things, historically high interest rates, mortgage rates. The churn does remain at historically low levels and the company did experience solid EBITDA growth at 2.8% in the first quarter. We are comfortable management can achieve EBITDA growth throughout the year while investing in the business and despite facing industry pressures, and they'll achieve that largely due to expense management, which is working quite well.Mobile, bright spot continues to perform nicely. Charter surpassed 8 million total mobile lines, and mobile service revenue accelerated 38% versus the prior year. We're quite pleased with the Spectrum One performance, and we're seeing improving mobile EBITDA as the promotional lines continue to roll off and the business achieves economies of scale. The anytime upgrade program is going to expand our market opportunity, and we do see increased stickiness with customers, Internet churn is down versus the prior year. As many of you know, unfortunately, the ACP program was not renewed. In light of that, Charter is offering a range of options to retain ACP customers, including the Spectrum Internet Assist program, the Internet 100 product and a retention offer of free mobile for 1 year. Looking briefly at the balance sheet at Charter, we do expect leverage will move toward the midpoint of the 4 to 4.5 leverage target while maintaining the buyback this year.Turning briefly at L-TRIP. Many of you may have seen that we filed a 13D this morning, which outlined the ceased transaction discussions with third parties. We do continue to discuss strategic alternatives with TripAdvisor Special Committee. We will not be able to comment further on this unless definitive documents are executed or discussions terminate. Looking at TripAdvisor itself. TripAdvisor had a good start to the first quarter, but it did also offer more muted guidance on its call this morning. Travel and experiences remain high priorities for consumers despite geopolitical activity and inflationary pressures. At brand TripAdvisor, Hotel Meta performance was driven by sustained pricing strength offset by lower click volumes. Trip's AI tool is continuing to scale very well and the addition of bookable experiences embedded in itineraries is generating 50% higher average revenue per user. Viator itself saw record app downloads, conversion growth and app bookings.So with that, I'll turn it over to Brian to discuss the financials."", 'Brian J. Wendling', ""Thank you, Greg. At quarter end, Liberty Broadband had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of $108 million, which includes $70 million of cash at GCI. The value of our charter investment based on our shares held as of May 1 and Charter share price at yesterday's close was $12.3 billion. At quarter end, Liberty Broadband had a total principal amount of debt of $3.8 billion. Note, this excludes the preferred stock. Looking quickly at GCI. GCI's revenue and adjusted OIBDA were flat in the first quarter. Growth in data revenue in both business and consumer side, what was offset by declines in other revenue. The decline in the other revenue was primarily driven by declines in video revenue. We'd note though that the video business does not generate -- does not meaningfully impact margins or free cash flow.Over the last year, adjusted for the reclassification from GCI business, GCI consumers added 3,500 revenue-generating wireless subs and saw a small decline of 200 cable modem customers. GCI paid down its revolver by $60 million during the quarter using strong cash from operations. At quarter end, leverage as defined by its credit agreement was 2.8x. And GCI's credit facility had $457 million of undrawn capacity, net of letters of credit. Subsequent to quarter end, GCI distributed $150 million to Liberty Broadband funded with cash on hand and drawing under its revolver. These proceeds were used to pay down the Charter margin loan and were therefore net debt neutral to Liberty Broadband. Pro forma for the dividend payment, GCI's leverage was just under 3.2x with $327 million of undrawn capacity under its revolver net of letters of credit.And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Greg."", 'Gregory B. Maffei', ""Thanks, Brian. And to the listening audience, we appreciate your continued interest in Liberty Broadband and Liberty TripAdvisor. And with that, operator, I'd like to open the call for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question today comes from Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley.', 'Benjamin Daniel Swinburne', ""Greg, a couple of questions on Charter. Yesterday, there was a bipartisan group of senators introduced some -- an ACP Extension Act in the Senate, obviously. I don't know if you didn't mention anything in your prepared remarks on this front, but I'm curious if you have any -- if there's any ray of hope here that there might be a kick save last minute on ACP. And then similarly, on Charter, you could probably make an argument. I don't know if you would agree, probably not, given the Liberty lens that maybe deleveraging would be better for the equity value than buying back stock here. I'm just curious what your position is on that when you think about interest rates and kind of what the credit markets look like right now relative to the stock price and the company's free cash flow generation."", 'Gregory B. Maffei', ""I have to say I only just heard a little bit about the (inaudible) on the ACP extension. Don't know much to comment beyond it. I think there's always hope, but there is certainly a -- while there is some consensus both among Republicans and Democrats for extending it, there also seems to be many procedural issues that are -- why it might get tied up and therefore, we can't certainly count on it.On the leverage question, I think, Ben, you may have noticed that both our comments that in the near term, we expect to use more of the cash flow we get from Charter through buybacks to reduce our debt at Liberty Broadband. And I think you may have heard also that Charter expect to take its leverage level down from the closer to 4, 4.5 to the middle of that 4 to 4.5 range. So I think they have heard you, at least to the degree that while I think the company can support these levels of debt, both companies, we feel just to show the marketplace that we're responsive and the higher cost of interest, we're going to do some work at both sites to reduce the overall leverage."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Jeff Wlodarczak of Pivotal Research Group.', 'Jeffrey Duncan Wlodarczak', ""I'll also focus on Charter. Charter's EBITDA valuation is about as cheap as it's ever been. It's a discount to the telcos or most of the telcos. Just wondering if your thoughts, Greg, on the idea that maybe Charter should think about slowing down its footprint expansion and freeing up cash to do larger share repurchases? And then assuming ACP does happen, how successful do you think Charter is going to be with the tools that it has in not seeing some sort of ARPU hit in the second and third quarter and keeping most of those subs."", 'Gregory B. Maffei', 'Thanks for the question, Jeff. The -- I think on the question of slowdown, look, these are attractive opportunities that they have under beat and other programs, but they are being more thoughtful about them given the alternatives and given the general move towards the market wishing to see free cash flow versus line extension. So I think there are -- Chris and team have rightly had a very thoughtful, balanced approach. On ACP, I think there are a bunch of programs which are attractive and we should be able to do things to mitigate the loss. I do not think they anticipate -- big declines in ASP or average revenue per customer given what we have and how many customers we have and what those programs are likely to achieve.', 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Barton Crockett of Rosenblatt Securities.', 'Barton Evans Crockett', ""Okay. I also wanted to ask you, Greg, for thoughts on a cable question, which is the growth of mobile seems to be kind of the bright spot in the industry right now with headwinds on broadband and pay TV at the moment. And there's certainly been some great arguments put up by Charter about the success of some of the buy 1 get 1 free programs and the conversion on that. So Greg, I'm just wondering from your perspective, given that mobile is a great growth story, but it's still pretty small, not material, not really moving the needle in terms of investor sentiment. Do you think that there's an opportunity to invest more in mobile to move quicker to make it more material to pursue that future where your cable companies are the dominant kind of mobile providers like they were with plain old fashion telephone in years past. Do you think there's scope to do that? Just your thoughts there would be interesting."", 'Gregory B. Maffei', ""Thanks for the question, Barton. Look, I think you're right to note that mobile has been a bright spot. And Charter really has been the most aggressive pursuer that in the space among the cable companies. So I'm not sure how much more they can put their foot on the gas. The -- I think just in general, there's reduced activity coming into stores. All of that -- it's just there's been a slower process. So they're probably getting as much out of mobile as they can right now. And they are continuing to push that product, Charter, and I do see future success. I remain quite bullish on their growth in mobile and how long they'll be able to continue to take share."", 'Barton Evans Crockett', 'Okay. And then if I could switch gears and just ask on Liberty Broadband, given kind of the depressed valuations for cable assets all over the place, is there an opportunity for Liberty Broadband to look at rolling up other cable companies generally, is there some opportunity there? Is the door really closed on that thought at this moment?', 'Gregory B. Maffei', ""Barton, I don't think the door is closed, but in general, given the synergies that Charter has I think in most cases, we'd be better off trying to pursue it with Charter or through Charter than doing it directly. But I -- you can't say never. There could be one that makes more sense for us for one reason or another or Charter's appetite is less likely. But in general, I think we're quite aligned that it's an attractive opportunity, but there are an enormous number that are available now that would be appealing even given Charter's synergies."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from Michael Rollins of Citi.', 'Michael Ian Rollins', ""Just on Liberty Broadband, another question regarding just the broader NAV discount that you're currently assessing. What do you think the factors are that are driving that discount? And can you discuss the way the Board is prioritizing the possibility of shrinking that discount and the methods that you want to use to do that."", 'Gregory B. Maffei', ""Yes. I think we've talked about how these discounts have risen in the past. There are fewer peers, there are fewer funds which arbitrage the opportunity. There's more higher cost to borrow on some of those things. We've talked about all that. We're really not the key market participants to judge, but that's what we here. On what we're doing, generally, what we do is we advantage of the discount by doing share repurchase at the discounted number and we find that attractive. Obviously, that's slow a little bit with the pace of Charter's buyback itself. And that's our primary fuel for doing incremental buyback, though we do get free cash flow on GCI also. The ultimate mitigation of that usually comes in the form of what we've done with LSXM and SXM or what we did with Liberty Expedia and Expedia or what we did with Elmedia and DIRECTV, where we eventually somehow spin and combine it or if it's already spun, combine our holdco with the opco and end up with a fully valued stock. So that's the ultimate resolution. And in the interim, the primary means is share repurchase to try and take advantage of it."", 'Michael Ian Rollins', 'And in terms of that resolution, is there a significant amount of OpEx synergy or other considerations in the case of Liberty Broadband that investors should be mindful of?', 'Gregory B. Maffei', ""Well, Liberty Broadband has some corporate overhead, which would be eliminated in any kind of a transaction. And there, I suspect, would be synergies between GCI and Charter and GCI's ability to do more effective purchases of programming, more effective purchases of any network elements that would probably be more efficient than GCI can do on a stand-alone basis. So yes, there are probably some synergies there."", 'Operator', 'Our last question today comes from Jeff Bronchick of Cove Street Capital.', 'Jeffrey Bronchick', ""I'm going to talk about Trips. And my quick question would be to you is, do you think -- have the negotiation taken a, what I call, a Paramount like situation where really the interest is in buying the L-TRIP for control and that's meeting resistance from taking up all shareholders? Or is that not relevant?"", 'Gregory B. Maffei', ""I don't know enough about Paramount what's going on or not going on there. I only read what I read. So I can't make the analogy or not. I can say is as we had productive discussions with the special committee. We continue to have those discussions. And I don't think there is tension about any kind of Liberty Trip premium versus Trip. I don't think we've seen that tension in the discussions. And afraid, I really can't comment further than that."", 'Jeffrey Bronchick', 'Paramount, where, obviously, someone would like to buy the Redstone stake and I have to offer all other shareholders anything would be my reference.', 'Gregory B. Maffei', ""In general, I mean, just level -- one last point, we have worked hard to try and make sure that we treat all shareholders fairly and not disadvantaged. And I certainly haven't sought some big premium from (inaudible) position, we thought to try and make this the best possible transaction for all shareholders.With that, operator, I think we're done. And thank you to our listening audience once again, and thank you for your interest in Liberty Broadband and Liberty Trip. And we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter, if not sooner."", 'Operator', ""This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.""]"

To skip the detailed analysis of the gig economy market, go directly to the 5 Best Gig Economy Stocks To Buy.', 'The gig economy refers to a labor market characterized by short-term, freelance, or independent contractor positions, where individuals are hired on a temporary or flexible basis to complete specific tasks or projects. Gig workers are independent contractors who typically find work through online platforms or apps that connect them with clients or customers who are looking for various kinds of services such as coding, writing, and graphic designing, among others.', 'The COVID-19 pandemic was one of the main growth catalysts for gig workers and the number of these independent contractors is rising rapidly. According to a report by MBO Partners, 45% of the US American workforce worked as independent contractors in 2023. Between 2020 and 2023, the number of independent workers grew by 89%. The report states that 40% of the gig workers said that they used online platforms to find work over the last 12 months and 47% are planning to use them over the next 12 months.', 'According to Business Research Insights, the global gig economy market was valued at $14.75 billion in 2021. It is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20% between 2023 and 2031, reaching $92.9 billion at the end of the forecasted period. A report by the gig economy company, Upwork Inc. (NASDAQ:UPWK), posted in October 2023, revealed that Gen Z and millennials are the top earners in the gig economy with 45% of the former and 44% of the latter group making at least $2,500 a month from the platform. Moreover, as of 2022, North American and Western European citizens have the highest average freelance rates at $44 and $31 per hour, respectively. It is followed by South America at $24 per hour and Central America, Asia, Africa, and Central and Eastern Europe are all tied at $22 per hour.', 'On February 16, MoffettNathanson’s senior research analyst, Michael Morton told CNBC that the last 12 months have been quite positive for the gig economy stocks. He said that initially, the industry was considered a weak domain by investors because it consumed $125 billion of investor capital between 2015 and 2022 while being focused on expanding market share rather than increasing profitability. However, over the last year, companies like Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) and DoorDash, Inc. (NASDAQ:DASH) have experienced a “profitability explosion” due to their corporate decisions. Morton added that according to his firm, the total addressable market for the gig economy industry is around $4 trillion. He noted that grocery delivery is a trillion-dollar market that is “underpenetrated”, and there is a chance that Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) and DoorDash, Inc. (NASDAQ:DASH) could also capture a noteworthy share of this market very soon.', 'Micheal Morton mentioned that he has heard people refer to Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) and DoorDash, Inc. (NASDAQ:DASH) as “undeletable apps” and noted several growth prospects for these companies. They are some of the biggest gig economy companies in the world. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) posted its FY23 earnings on February 7, reporting that its gross bookings were up 19% year-over-over, and it generated a revenue of $37.28 billion, up 17% year-over-year. The company reported a net income of $1.887 billion, compared to a net loss of $9.14 billion in FY22.', 'While Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) seems to have a promising future, it faced several headwinds in the first quarter of 2024 due to which its earnings and revenues declined slightly. It reported its Q1 earnings on May 8 with a loss per share of $0.32. Nevertheless, the company’s revenue was up 15%\xa0 year-over-year at $10.1 billion, and income from operations was $172 million, up $434 million from Q1 2023. The company reached an adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 billion, up 82% year-over-year, marking a new quarterly record for Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER). The company also generated a free cash flow of $4.2 billion over the trailing twelve months. The company’s CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah, made the following remarks:', '“Q1 marked another strong quarter for Uber. Gross Bookings growth remained consistent at 21% YoY on a constant-currency basis (22% excluding Freight), as we generated Gross Bookings of $37.7 billion. We landed just shy of our guidance midpoint, with softer Mobility activity in LatAm as we lapped heightened demand during Carnival last year, coupled with the impact of holidays shifting into Q1 of this year. Foreign exchange was a headwind of roughly $205 million YoY or roughly 70 bps. We grew our revenue by 15% YoY on a constant-currency basis to $10.1 billion, which includes a 8 percentage point YoY headwind related to business model changes. As a reminder, certain business model changes, which have no impact on profitability, negatively impacted revenue reporting by $742 million. We expect to lap the majority of these business model changes in the second half of this year.', 'We converted this strong top-line growth into solid profitability, with all-time high Adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 billion, up 82% YoY, and a record Adjusted EBITDA margin of 3.7% of Gross Bookings, an increase of 130 bps YoY. We intentionally held back some of our in-market Mobility investments with lower ROI as Q1 is typically a lighter quarter due to seasonal Mobility rider behaviors. We remain focused on striking the right balance between growth and profitability, and running Uber to deliver on the 3-year financial framework we set in February.”', 'On February 15, DoorDash, Inc. (NASDAQ:DASH) reported a net loss attributed to the company and shareholders of $558 million for FY23, compared to a net loss of $1.365 billion in FY22. The company generated a revenue of $8.6 billion in 2023, compared to $6.58 billion in 2022. It announced its first quarter 2024 earnings on May 1, reporting an EPS of -$0.06. The company’s GAAP net loss including redeemable non-controlling interests was $25 million, down from $162 million in Q1 2023. The revenue for the quarter was $2.51 billion, up 23% year-over-year, which outperformed the analyst estimates by $60 million. At DoorDash, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:DASH) Q1 earnings call, the CEO Ravi Inukonda said:', '“...consumer engagement and spending on the platform continues to be very strong. You can see that in our strong Q1 results, as well as the double-digit growth rate that we have driven consistently for the last two years in a row. I am not going to comment on the month-to-month, but it continues -- order frequency continues to be very good.', ""In fact, it's an all-time high. Retention continues to be very strong in the business, retention this past quarter is higher than the prior quarter. We feel very confident about the input metrics we are seeing and I feel very good about the guidance for Q2.”"", 'As mentioned by Michael Morton, the gig economy industry is expected to grow significantly in the future with a $4 trillion total addressable market, and companies are rushing to capture a major chunk of it.

We think private rentals should continue to grow their share of overall accommodation stays, potentially up to 30% of lodging or higher over the long term, letting the private rental gross booking value grow at a low double-digit rate. We also think Airbnb should continue to gain share within the private rental market as its global network effects strengthen, allowing for mid-teens revenue growth.

Most notably, grocery delivery is a largely untapped market due to inventory management challenges (in-person grocery shopping involves a high degree of product substitution). This business unit has been losing money. However, the company believes it has a competitive cost advantage given its existing Dasher network, and continued growth will lead to profitability—something it is not getting credit for by the market.

Even better, those rewards are often easy to earn through credit cards. Here are just a few of the ways your cards can get you to Italy."", ""The simplest way to make your Italy trip happen with travel credit cards is to redeem your points through the issuer's travel portal. These are the four most popular programs:"", 'Featured offer: save money while you pay off debt with one of these top-rated balance transfer credit cards', 'American Express Membership Rewards', 'Capital One Venture Rewards', 'Chase Ultimate Rewards', 'Citi ThankYou Rewards', ""This method is nice because you don't need to look for special award tickets; you can simply choose the flights (and hotel, and rental car) that works for you and use points to pay for it. Plus, it's great for keeping your out-of-pocket costs to a minimum since you can typically cover all of the costs -- right down to the fees -- with your rewards."", ""The downside here is that you won't be maximizing the value of your points. Transferring your credit card rewards to an airline frequent flyer program, then redeeming those miles for travel, can often score you a higher per-point return."", ""The most popular way to fly for free is through airline miles, either transferred from a travel card or earned directly (by flying or with a co-branded airline credit card). Every airline I've come across has a frequent flyer program that lets you book flights using rewards."", ""The potential for fees: If you're using airline miles to book a flight, be prepared to pay at least a small amount in cash to cover applicable taxes and fees. Often, it's nominal; you might pay $5 or $10. Other times it's ridiculous. For instance, most flights to or from (or even through) the UK have outlandish surcharges: I've seen them reach $1,000 or more on a one-way business flight."", 'The cheapest flights to Italy came from American Airlines. I found nonstop business class availability this fall going to Rome and Milan from a few U.S. hubs for just 65,000 AA miles plus $5.60 in fees.', ""Unfortunately, AA isn't a regular transfer partner of the four credit card programs. That said, you can earn AA miles through any AAdvantage co-branded airline cards. AA offers both personal and business cards."", 'American Airlines is part of the Oneworld airline alliance, which also includes British Airways and Ibera. As such, you can book AA flights through the BA or Iberia websites using Avios points. Amex and Chase will transfer to both airlines, giving you a roundabout way to use transferable points to book American Airlines.', ""The consideration here is you may need to fork over both more rewards and more cash if you go this route. For instance, the above flight from AA would run you 77,250 Avios plus $232.80 in fees when booked through Iberia. If you want an option that lets you transfer points, however, it's definitely still a great deal for business class to Europe."", 'Another decent deal was from United Airlines with business class flights (with various layovers) starting at 88,000 United miles plus $12.50 in fees. (If you want nonstop, they were going for an eye-widening 174,500 miles, plus $5.60 in fees.)', 'United miles can be earned directly via the MIleagePlus co-branded cards. Or you can transfer Chase Ultimate Rewards points.', ""So, the most observant readers may have noticed this is an article about flying to Italy and I have yet to mention Italy's own ITA Airways. There's a pretty important reason why: It's stinkin' hard to earn Volare points (the ITA currency). There is an Amex card, but it's not available in the U.S. as far as I can tell. And none of the major programs transfer to ITA Volare, either."", ""However, last year, Virgin Atlantic and ITA announced a partnership that would let you cross-book the airlines via the other's rewards. In theory, this is great, as Amex, Chase, and Citi all transfer 1:1 to Virgin Atlantic."", ""In reality, it's less awesome."", ""I searched dozens of routes, from both coasts, at all different times of year, including routes that I 100% knew were available via ITA -- I couldn't find a single ITA business class seat on Virgin's website, let alone an award seat. (In fact, I didn't spot any ITA flights at all.) You may have to call to book these flights."", ""If you don't mind a layover in Paris, consider Air France/KLM. I found flights from NYC to Rome for as low as 55,000 Flying Blue miles plus $218.30 in fees. All four major rewards programs transfer 1:1 to Flying Blue, the rewards program for Air France/KLM. (There is also a middle-of-the-road co-branded card with Bank of America.)"", ""If you don't have any Flying Blue miles but have some Flying Club points, check Virgin Atlantic's website. While I didn't find anything for ITA Airways, I did find a decent selection of business class awards operated by Air France/KLM."", ""Most flights cost 48,500 Flying Club points plus $291.30 in fees. That's 6,500 fewer points, but $73 more dollars. (That works out to $0.011 per extra point.) Depending on how you personally value Virgin Atlantic points -- or the rewards that you turn into them -- this could be a worthwhile trade."", 'These are just a few of the options for getting to Italy for (mostly) free in business class.

It's the second-largest U.S. bank by assets but it also has a consumer banking focus. Buffett likely appreciates this consumer focus. The consumer banking business was strong in the 2024 first quarter, and BofA added 245,000 new checking accounts in the quarter for the 21st consecutive quarter of increased accounts. It also added 1 million credit cards and a record 3.9 million investing accounts."", 'Its other segments are growing as well. It added 7,300 relationships in Global Wealth and Investment Management and 29,000 new bank accounts, and it ended the quarter with assets under management of close to $4 trillion, a 13% year-over-year increase.', ""At the moment, Bank of America is feeling some economic pressure associated with inflation and elevated interest rates. That combination results in slower general economic activity and higher default rates in loans and other credit products. Revenue decreased 2% year over year in the quarter, and earnings per share (EPS) excluding a one-time assessment expense declined from $0.94 last year to $0.83 this year. However, it maintained strong profitability, with adjusted net income of $7.2 billion and a strong capital position with common equity tier 1 capital of $197 billion. BofA cut about 4,700 jobs over the past year to reduce costs, and it's benefiting from investments in automation and its digital platform that are driving cost optimization."", ""BofA spent $4.4 billion on share repurchases and dividends in the first quarter, and the dividend yields 2.6% at the current price. Bank of America stock is up 10% this year, beating the market, but it's trading at a price to tangible book value of 1.5, or lower than its 5-year average and lower than most of its peers. It's a strong anchor stock with a reliable and growing dividend."", ""In public settings, Buffett often talks about Coca-Cola and American Express, his two longest-held stocks. At this year's annual meeting, he asserted that there is a consensus in the world that there may not be any other companies that can compete with American Express and Coca-Cola. Part of the reason these companies have an advantage is their dividends, which Buffett has an affinity for. It's likely a significant reason why American Express makes up 9.7% of the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio."", 'Berkshire also owns competing credit card networks Visa and Mastercard, but they account for just 0.6% and 0.5% of the overall portfolio, respectively.', ""Most consumers think of American Express as a credit card network, but its business model is different from Visa and Mastercard's. American Express operates a bank, unlike the others, which serves as the lending partner for the credit cards as well as offering various fintech services. There are advantages and disadvantages to this model. One of the disadvantages is that it's subject to interest rate fluctuations more acutely, it is directly affected by defaults, and it has to make provisions for losses that can impact its bottom line. On the other hand, as a bank, it has deposits, which it can invest and use to generate net interest income, which helps the bottom line. It also has lots of cash -- something Buffett loves."", ""American Express' dividend yield is also consistently higher than both Visa and Mastercard's."", 'It has been reporting strong performance despite elevated inflation. Revenue increased 11% year over year in the 2024 first quarter to $15.8 billion, and EPS rose 39% to $3.33.

I'd now like to turn the call over to Lloyd."", 'Lloyd M. Yates', ""Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 3. The NiSource investment thesis is simple. We serve our customers by delivering safe and reliable energy at an affordable price. Affordable energy delivery requires deployment of capital and operating assets efficiently. It requires operating in jurisdictions which have constructive regulatory mechanisms. The byproduct of these fundamentals generates competitive regulated returns for our shareholders while maintaining and improving our balance sheet position. Capital deployment comes from a $16.4 billion base CapEx plan projected over the next 5 years, plus over $1.5 billion in upside projects as well as substantial opportunity for investment beyond 2028. The stable public policy and ratemaking in our states across multiple election and regulatory appointment cycles has been crucial to efficient capital allocation and recovery to support our communities. Our balance sheet is derisked and more flexible than ever before and enables industry-leading sustainable organic investment. As part of this flexibility, we are more disciplined and return-focused with our internal allocation decisions whenever. We recognize the competitive environment for capital and we do not take your investment for granted. Our total year-end 2023 rate base was $18.8 billion, consisting of $9 billion in Indiana, $4 billion in Ohio, $3 billion in Pennsylvania and over $1 billion in Virginia. Our nearly 4 million customers contribute to gross domestic product of over $3.8 trillion across our 6 states of operation or approximately 14% of U.S. GDP. We expect our system to see substantial low growth over the next 5 years due to data centers and reshoring of manufacturing. Northern Indiana offers constructive fundamentals for data center development through robust electric transmission, overall energy system capacity, plentiful land, limited physical disaster risk, tax incentives and a pro-business policy environment. During the last 5 years, NIPSCO and the Columbia gas family of companies have contributed over $1.4 billion in property taxes in their local communities. This funding goes to schools, parks, roads, emergency and other essential services and keeps our communities moving in the right direction. Each and every day of the year, we provide safe, reliable, sustainable and cost-effective service for our customers. Slide 4 shows our key priorities. Today, we reported first quarter 2024 adjusted EPS of $0.85, 10% above the $0.77 reported 1 year ago. We are reaffirming 2024 adjusted EPS guidance of $1.70 to $1.74. We are also reaffirming annual 2023 to 2028 guidance for adjusted EPS of 6% to 8% and rate base of 8% to 10%. We continue to target FFO to debt of 14% to 16% in all years of the client. Our superior regulatory and stakeholder foundation is differentiated. We have a long history of working collaboratively to deliver value across diverse constituencies. The most recent example is our NIPSCO Gas general rate case settlement announced in March. Late in the quarter, we also filed CPCN amendments for full ownership of the Fairbanks and Gibson Solar Projects. This follows CPCN amendment approvals from the IURC for Cavalry and Dunns Bridge II in January. Our intention has been to layer projects into our base plan during the course of the year. Consistent with our pending request at the IURC, today, I am pleased to announce we are adding full ownership of the Fairbanks and Gibson projects to our base capital plan. This incremental NiSource investment simplifies the project structure and reduces cost to customers when compared to the prior tax equity configuration. Reliability and efficiency remain core elements of our operational excellence culture as seen on Slide 5. In 2022, we began the process of upgrading outdated technology that, in some cases, predated the Columbia Gas merger in 2000.Our multiyear technology investment initiative is continuing to take shape with work and asset management programs addressing the scheduling dispatch and execution of work and the management of underlying assets, an upfront investment can drive decades of both reliability improvement and cost savings for customers. In March, NIPSCO requested a regulatory deferral mechanism for these investments, seeking to align ratemaking with long-term customer value realization. Amid increasing weather extremes and natural disaster frequency throughout the country, customers are benefiting from energy resiliency more than ever. NiSource delivered this through multiple channels with both major gas and electric systems.Our electric generation mix includes renewables and on-demand natural gas, balancing intermittency and fuel price volatility risk. Meanwhile, our gas system is insulated from harsh weather and can deliver dependable energy for our customers and even the most extreme conditions. I want to wrap up my comments by acknowledging each of our over 11,000 employees and contractors. Without their tireless effort on behalf of our customers, none of this work will be possible. I'll now turn things over to Melody."", 'Melody Birmingham', ""*Thank you, Lloyd. I'd like to turn to Slide 6 to give you an overview of NiSource's safety journey since 2017. We often get asked by investors new to the company for a picture of specific risk mitigation metrics over time. I'll begin by saying that the magnitude of change at the company over the last 6 years cannot be overstated. Our centralized operations team has implemented both engineering design and process-based solutions to improve our gas system safety. Our system management system -- our safety management system was recently reconfirmed for American Petroleum Institute recommended Practice 1173, making NiSource one of only two utilities in the world to maintain this designation. We also completed a conformance assessment and are pursuing certification for standard 55001, an International Organization for Standardization, or ISO. This validates advancement in our asset management practice maturity and illustrates our commitment to optimizing value through a balance of risk, asset performance and costs.Our gas assets now have automatic shutoff valves and remote pressure monitoring on 100% of low-pressure systems. Isometric drawings provide 3D renderings of all our regulating stations. We have 36% fewer miles of pipe designated as priority compared to year ending 2017. 51% of our 55,000 mile system has been surveyed with advanced mobile leak detection vehicles. 98% of our gas service lines are mapped as of the year-end 2023, which is up from only 4% 6 years ago. These tangible verified metrics are only a part of our story. Leading-edge safety management is fueled by culture and it's critical to any safety work environment. Every day, our NiSource team lives the Core 4 through employee certification and training, knowledge transfer, technology utilization and community engagement. Let's move to Slide 7, where you'll see a timeline of our regulatory activity. As we've said previously, our 5-year financial plan does not include extensive regulatory stay-out period. We've had the ability to employ capital trackers and/or forward-looking rate case test years on the majority of our capital expenditures. Columbia Gas of Ohio recently filed its annual infrastructure replacement program, or IRP tracker for $231 million of capital investment with a requested effective date this month. In March, NIPSCO's gas settlement was the result of the rigorous rate case process in Indiana and involved a highly engaged stakeholder group of intervenors working with our team and all parties, either signing or not opposing the agreement. A final order is expected in the third quarter of this year. We kicked off our triennial Integrated Resource Plan or IRP process in April with the first of five stakeholder meetings planned for this year. Throughout the process, all interested parties will provide extensive information on low requirements and generation planning for the report's 20-year time horizon. These are just some examples of our commitment to proactive engagement with our stakeholders. We have a high degree of confidence in the value of our investments for our communities and we work regularly to ensure that there are no surprises during the regulatory cycle. Economic development continues to be a competitive advantage for our service territories. One in particular, a project Virginia-based Northrop Grumman broke ground earlier this year on a $200 million advanced electronics manufacturing and testing facility in the town of Waynesboro. This growing customer base here and throughout are NiSource service areas requires new gas infrastructure but also makes the entire system more economic for all of our customers. Across the NiSource footprint, we have invested more than $1.7 billion of capital expenditures over the 12-month period ending in March. During the same time period, residential gas customer bills actually decreased by 15%. With that, let me turn it over now to Shawn to review our capital projects and financial results."", 'Shawn Anderson', ""Thanks, Melody. Let's begin on Slide 8. We are steadfast in our commitment to deliver safe and reliable energy to our customers at an affordable price. Growing our investment opportunity is a crucial element to this, and our base capital plan is now comprised of a portfolio of projects projected at $16.4 billion through 2028. The plan is driven by programmatic and enduring investments necessary to maintain safe, reliable and sustainable energy infrastructure that our customers deserve.These investments are diversified across renewable electricity, gas and electric customer growth, distribution modernization and system hardening for both the electric and gas businesses. Importantly, there is limited large individual project execution risk in our plan. Moving ahead to Slide 9, I'd like to provide an update on our renewable development program. The table shows base plan amounts, and reflects incremental CapEx from the full ownership of the Fairbanks and Gibson solar projects, which Lloyd just highlighted. By displacing tax equity investor capital and removing the associated joint venture structure, we are able to reduce customer bills relative to our prior plan and be more resilient in our operations over the energy generated for our customers. In the aggregate, our billions of dollars of renewable generation investments negotiated since 2019 remains significantly cheaper and lower risk for our customers compared to the alternative status quo scenario across their useful life. NIPSCO's final coal retirements continue to project to conclude by 2028. And in each of the remaining 4 owned and 4 PPA renewable projects remain on schedule for in-service. On Slide 10, you'll see an overview of additional investment opportunities. We continue to identify capital investment opportunities to enhance service for our communities beyond the capital projected in the base plan. Generation investments, gas distribution and transmission system modernization, Advanced metering and renewable natural gas investments all represent potential upside investments compared to our current base plan. The long-term plan does not currently include any data center load growth assumptions or significant infrastructure investments and upgrades. However, we are receiving robust inquiries from potential customers looking to invest in our Northern Indiana electric service territory due to the attractive business climate we know and appreciate in Indiana. We are focused on developing accretive projects across all utility companies to support our stakeholders and we intend to move projects from the upside category into our base capital plan as they meet our threshold of stakeholder alignment and execution visibility just as we've done this quarter. As Melody highlighted, NIPSCO has commenced its triennial electric integrated resource planning process.The process will provide a point of view on generation and capacity required to serve customers beyond the retirement of our last existing coal units by 2028. It builds on generation already included in our 5-year base capital plan and will analyze energy demand projected across the next 2 decades associated with economic development including potential data center development, electrification, electric vehicle utilization as well as incorporating changing policy and resource adequacy requirements. The process will conclude with a filing at the IURC this fall. We'll focus next on Slide 11. And I'd like to point out 2 changes to our financial disclosures this quarter. First, with the completion of the NIPSCO minority interest transaction, we have realigned segments to reflect the new ownership structure; second, to simplify presentation and better align our performance metrics with peer companies, we are changing the name of our primary financial metric to adjusted EPS from net operating earnings per share, as previously referenced. This refers to non-GAAP fully diluted earnings per share, and there are no changes to the underlying calculation of this metric. First quarter adjusted EPS was $0.85, a 10% increase over the $0.77 reported last year. Positive results from regulatory activity and other income were partly offset by higher O&M and depreciation. Normalized customer usage drove an $8 million and $4 million pretax benefit at the Columbia and NIPSCO segments, respectively.Interest expense and preferred interest netted to roughly no change following the NIPSCO minority interest transaction and the redemption of the last tranche of our preferred equity securities issued in 2018. For years, NiSource has adjusted GAAP net income and EPS to present a weather-adjusted figure for our investors to project comparable performance periods. While following the mild weather experienced this quarter, I also want to remind you of the underlying regulatory mechanisms insulating both shareholder cash flow and customer bill volatility. All of our gas jurisdictions will have weather decoupling mechanisms should our gas settlement be approved later this year. The mechanisms apply to select customer classes and a range from a full decoupling to partial decoupling and provide more stable customer bills and cash receipts in volatile weather periods. Our long-term financial guidance commitments are shown on Slide 12. As Lloyd mentioned, we are reaffirming the current guidance of $1.70 to $1.74 in adjusted EPS for 2024. All of our 5-year commitments are reaffirmed today as well. This includes the year-over-year adjusted EPS growth rate delivered at 6% to 8% annually off of the achieved results in 2024. We remain confident in achieving our 2024 guidance and our long-term growth rate in all remaining years of the plan. Increased visibility of the return of capital through highly constructive regulatory mechanisms, enhanced visibility into the financial results for 2025 and beyond. Our internal forecasts incorporate continued use of long-established capital trackers in nearly all our jurisdictions, and are based on what we believe are realistic regulatory outcomes.O&M discipline also remains a key assumption and a flexible part of achieving our 5-year commitments. Our cost of capital assumptions are resilient and reflect the rate environment from third quarter 2023. And most importantly, we're still able to deliver our $16.4 billion base investment plan to customers while keeping average annual residential total build growth at or below 4% during the 5-year period. Stable and low commodity prices available in our region support our unwavering focus on customer value, allowing us to maintain this commitment. Slide 13 details our financing plan. We are reaffirming our 14% to 16% FFO to debt in all years of the plan. In March, S&P completed their annual review with no change to our BBB+ rating and stable outlook. Our expected equity issuances for 2024 are on track to be completed by year-end through the use of our ATM with approximately 1/3 executed to date, and we continue to have the option to use a forward structure to align proceeds with our flow of work, a flexible financing plan such as utilizing our ATM, the NIPSCO minority interest transaction, potential use of hybrid securities and senior unsecured debt are examples of our plan's diverse funding sources and balance sheet flexibility, enabling us to navigate the balance between growth and credit quality. The figures shown on this page support our base capital plan, including the additions Lloyd mentioned earlier, the full ownership capital investments of the Fairbanks and Gibson projects substitutes in tax transferability from tax equity funding. Credit agency treatment of upfront cash supports FFO to debt compared to traditional capital expenditures. Despite the addition of $400 million of investment to our plan, our equity needs through this 5-year period remain unchanged due to the positive cash flow attributes of this substitute.I'd like to conclude by highlighting another quarter of meeting our commitments on Slide 14. Our financial commitments are resilient over the 5-year period through 2028, and our first quarter results keep us on track to meet our previously increased 2024 EPS guidance. The NIPSCO gas settlement and continued employment of capital trackers underscore our superior regulatory and stakeholder foundation, increasing investment in our base capital expenditure plan without modifying the need for external equity demonstrates our balance sheet flexibility.And finally, our revised base and upside CapEx figures demonstrate the programmatic and enduring nature of our plan. The value proposition NiSource continues to offer investors is a diversified and fully regulated utility with the opportunity to invest in both programmatic gas infrastructure and the long-term energy transition story for a fully integrated electric business. While this fundamental has previously been the case, the emerging opportunity to support unprecedented energy development and power demand resulting from robust economic development, onshoring as well as new data center development truly differentiates the value proposition relative to many alternatives in the marketplace today. And now I'd like to turn the call back to the operator for Q&A."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Constantine Lednev.', 'Shahriar Pourreza', ""It's Shahriar for Constantine. Let me just on the data center side. I mean, obviously, we've all seen kind of media reports of kind of maybe just sizable data centers coming to Indiana, including Amazon, right? I guess can you maybe talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of that potential demand and what it means to the overall plan. I guess, can you be a little bit more specific on when it can hit the plan?And when it obviously more important, this whole topic of rate design as you guys are attracting data centers or also trying to protect, I guess, that residential customer base. How are you thinking about rate design and maybe special tariffs for these hyperscalers? As you're in discussions, I mean, would you need to file updated proceedings in order to get the rates?"", 'Lloyd M. Yates', ""So I think as I said in some of my remarks, I think Shawn also repeated it. When you think about the NIPSCO system in Northern Indiana, and we have a number of fundamentals, one, a very robust transmission system, plentiful land, a lot of farmland there, available energy capacity. Great energy policy, really enhance a really positive place to do business. I mean you start to realize a region is right for data center development. And because of that, we are in the midst and have been midst of discussions with several data center developers, and we're really optimistic about the opportunity to grow our load with respect to data centers.I think you said something really important and that is -- I think we're working hard on how we're evaluating ways to structure the opportunity so that it benefits all stakeholders. That includes our customers, our shareholders and the communities we serve. So I know I'm not directly answering your question because we don't have real specifics. We like to have detail and have quantifiable detail before we put them into our IRP and our load growth projections. And we're still working on those things, although we are very optimistic about our ability to develop data centers in the NIPSCO service territory."", 'Shahriar Pourreza', ""Perfect. I appreciate that, Lloyd. And then just lastly here, I know you've mentioned before you ensure that you could ramp up the ATM to cover sort of any incremental equity needs from upside CapEx that's being shifted over to the plan, right? I guess for the remaining $1.6 billion of upside capital, what could sort of be -- what could be next in terms of projects that move into that base plan from there? And then just more importantly, how do we think about the funding source for that?"", 'Lloyd M. Yates', ""So I'll ask Shawn handle that. Maybe Michael will help him."", 'Shawn Anderson', ""Yes. So Shar, first and foremost, I think your question on what are the types of projects, the upside CapEx plan. So still have some electric generation projects in our upside plan based on the results of the 2021 IRP. So we'll watch the 2024 IRP process to understand how these upside projects might fit in our investment timelines. I think gas infrastructure work around PHMSA requirements and some of the additional projects stand out to us are compelling, particularly based on compliance requirements, but we need to watch and see how that plays itself out from a rule-making standpoint.Likewise, electric T&D has several projects, which could create upside to the plan, both as we think about MISO Tranche 1 and maybe as we start to approach the next decade Tranche 2. But grid modernization and system hardening is still important work for us to deliver reliable service. And then to Lloyd's point, I mean, we added the economic development and data center and technology innovation support the energy infrastructure to deliver that to Slide 10 as we start to think about the formulation of our upside plan. We think there's a lot of work there, but economic development is challenging. It requires alignment for many different stakeholders, but it can make a big splash for our communities, just like the Intel project did in Central Ohio. So it's entirely possible that these -- the portfolio of these projects develop and could do so quickly. But we don't put those into the base plan as Lloyd said until we're highly certain that these are projects that can deliver value. And then in terms of financing for these projects, we'll evaluate this as it arises. Part of the criteria for investing in these upside projects is seeking accretive projects to help NiSource and our communities grow. We believe the portfolio of projects that we've identified will help us do just that. And in many cases, we think the financing required will be fairly efficient because of the profile of these projects. Fortunately, we operate in constructive regulatory jurisdictions with efficient regulatory mechanisms, which balance the value creation for customers and shareholders. But we're a fully regulated business and committed to balancing our capital structure to ensure the credit quality that we've been able to obtain here, and we'll be committed to do so."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of JPMorgan Chase.', 'Richard Wallace Sunderland', ""Picking up the data center question again, just curious if you see the IRP, the '24 IRP to be specific, as the best look over the next, say, 12 months on how that might layer in incrementally to your current plan? Or do you see things still evolving, I guess, either faster or slower than that process?"", 'Lloyd M. Yates', 'So I think it could be a combination of both, but things could definitely evolve faster than the IRP process in Indiana. I think just like all the other companies across the industry, the data center developers are talking to a lot of people. I think that they are looking for utilities or energy companies that can move quickly. We want to be one of those. And I think that process may develop or could or probably will develop faster than the IRP process.', 'Richard Wallace Sunderland', 'Got it. Very helpful color there. And then just a few regulatory items, Pennsylvania rate case. Anything you can speak to on kind of stakeholder engagement there, how the process has been running so far and how you feel about kind of catalysts over the back half of the year with regards to those case milestones, maybe prospects for settlement? And then separately, the NIPSCO deferral, you referenced, kind of any timeline to think about on getting an approval there? And does that have any financial impacts to the plan that we should think about?', 'Lloyd M. Yates', 'I will pass it to Melody who heads up our regulatory utilities.', 'Melody Birmingham', 'Yes. Can you hear me okay?', 'Richard Wallace Sunderland', 'Yes, we hear you.', 'Melody Birmingham', ""Okay. Very good. As far as the Pennsylvania rate case, which you -- that we filed March 15, it's coming along well, our team continues to engage with our stakeholders there in Pennsylvania. This is not the first time, just so you know, when we have a rate case that we began to have discussions with the stakeholders or to understand what intervenors are wanting or expecting from us. So it's an ongoing dialogue that the team and Pennsylvania has throughout the year up until the time that we file. We -- with all cases, they're uncertain, but we do work to stay as aligned as possible with the stakeholders to mitigate any surprises. So I would say it's going as well as we expect at this point. And then your next question?"", 'Richard Wallace Sunderland', 'The NIPSCO deferral. Just overall timing to get an outcome there? And is that something that we should think about having a financial impact or rate case timing impact or anything else?', 'Lloyd M. Yates', 'So it should not have an impact on the rate case. We still expect to get an order on the NIPSCO gas rate case sometime this summer. And because of the deferral mechanism, it should not have a negative impact on our financials.', 'Operator', 'Next question comes from the line of Miller Travis.', 'Travis Miller', ""This is Travis Miller. On the $1.6 billion of upside, the slide there, some of those gas-related upside numbers. Can you talk about what jurisdictions have the most upside? And again, I realize there's a scale difference here, but just maybe on a percentage basis, which of those gas jurisdictions do you think could check a lot of the boxes here in terms of the upside?"", 'Lloyd M. Yates', 'I mean I think the way to think about it is to think about the size of our jurisdictions, right? So you think about Ohio, Indiana and then Pennsylvania will have the broadest impact in terms of capital investment from those rules of that $1.6 billion.', 'Travis Miller', 'On a scale basis, would -- are there other opportunities in the smaller one...', 'Lloyd M. Yates', ""There are. You asked the biggest impact. I think there are opportunities in all of those jurisdictions for capital investment as a result of the new rules. But again, it will be, I'd say, allocated to be a size of the jurisdiction is the way to think about that. Michael, do you want to add anything to that?"", 'Michael S. Luhrs', ""Yes. The only thing I would add to that is when we look across all of our territories, that's one of the benefits of having sort of the diversified territories and what we have in our current capabilities. And so you can take things such as in Virginia, there is very constructive legislation around biofuels that allow us to look at those opportunities. If you look at many of our others, we have multiple opportunities, whether that be through what's already been mentioned in the economic development side or AMI transitions associated with it or some of the opportunities when we're looking at what we're going to have to do associated with just hardening in the electric liability that Shawn mentioned earlier. Quite frankly, there's a pretty strong pipeline of opportunities for that $1.6 billion upside. And just as we've done previously, as you've seen with some of the full ownership on the projects as we work through those methodically, we will bring those into the plan and make sure that we announce them once we have that level of confidence, as Lloyd mentioned."", 'Shawn Anderson', ""Yes. Maybe one last point here, this is Shawn. The stakeholder alignment is critical, and so the timing to implement the rules will matter as you think about our current CapEx plan, '23 to '28. So we'll need to pace that through. So what you'll see if it moves from the upside plan to the base plan will be actionable projects within the context of the timing of this CapEx plan. But those rules could extend the amount of work into the early 2030s. And so how we segment that along the actual jurisdictions that Michael just referenced will be dictated a lot by our stakeholder engagement and the pacing set forth by themselves."", 'Travis Miller', ""Perfect. That's really helpful. And then one other, obviously, the hot topic of the data center. But if you think about your mix of business in terms of gas and electric, how much upside or available upside at least is manufacturing, which you mentioned versus data centers?"", 'Lloyd M. Yates', ""Yes. So I'd say some -- I mean, I think you started thinking about the economic development in Ohio, in Indiana outside of data centers is really strong. You think about reshore and you think about the Intel project just here in Columbus, you think of some of the battery, Stellantis in Indiana. I mean, reshoring or onshoring; however, you want to characterize that is, again, a great opportunity for us. We are strengthening our economic development pipeline getting more focused on that because there are more people interested in that. I mean, I think we have -- I mean the -- one of the strengths of the company is we did -- the jurisdictions we operate in, most if it, not all of our states, provide huge economic development incentives and people are very motivated to create manufacturing jobs where possible. That's the one thing no matter what your politics or everybody agrees on job creation and economic development and we're positioned very well to take advantage of those."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from UBS Securities.', 'William Appicelli', ""It's Bill Appicelli from UBS. Just going back to the technology capital deferral mechanism. I guess how much capital could flow through that? And then just to clarify, that would be a deferral on D&A and O&M."", 'Shawn Anderson', ""Yes, this is Shawn. I'll take that. The existing project cost allocation is set forth to be about $250 million across NiSource, but that splits itself to the allocation across their jurisdiction. So think about it around $150 million of capital that will flow through NIPSCO, both on the electric side and the gas side. And then -- yes, it covers the onetime O&M component of it and then some depreciation and amortization."", 'William Appicelli', 'Okay. All right. Great. And then just going back to the PHMSA rules and maybe can you just share exactly what you need to see coming out of that final rule making to trigger some of the incremental capital opportunities?', 'Lloyd M. Yates', ""Yes. I mean we are actively involved with federal government and I'll say the PHMSA rulemaking. As you probably know, PHMSA is about really grading leaks and repair timelines and leak detection methodologies. We think those rules will be finalized by the end of this -- by the end of 2024, so far and as we start to develop plans for compliance to those rules, you'll start to see us have input to our capital plan or additions to our capital plan to facilitate those rules by some time in the middle of the plan. So if you develop a compliance plan within 18 months. And in 36 months, you kind of have to roll into your capital plan. So we expect to see capital upside from the PHMSA rule sometime in the middle of the plan."", 'William Appicelli', ""Okay. All right. And then lastly, and apologies if you said this earlier, but on the ATM issuance, can you just remind us how much you've done year-to-date?"", 'Shawn Anderson', 'We did approximately 1/3 on the ATM to date.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And I will now turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.', 'Lloyd M. Yates', ""Again, thank you for participating in the phone call. We're optimistic about the NiSource plan. Appreciate the questions. Have a great day."", 'Operator', ""Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.""]"

The company, serving millions across various states, reported operating revenues of $1,706.3 million, a decrease from the previous year's $1,966.0 million. Despite this, NiSource managed to increase its net income available to common shareholders to $344.3 million, up from $319.2 million in the prior year, showcasing a resilient financial structure and effective cost management strategies."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with NI.', ""Infrastructure Investment and Safety Programs: NiSource Inc's commitment to long-term infrastructure investment and safety programs stands out as a significant strength. The company's dedication to improving safety and reliability has been a cornerstone of its strategy, ensuring customer satisfaction and regulatory compliance. This focus has not only enhanced the customer experience but has also positioned NiSource as a leader in operational excellence, certified in conformance to the American Petroleum Institute Recommended Practice 1173."", ""Regulatory Outcomes and Rate Increases: Another strength lies in NiSource's ability to navigate the regulatory landscape successfully. The company has secured favorable regulatory outcomes, leading to rate increases that have bolstered its financial performance. For instance, the increase in net income available to common shareholders for the first quarter of 2024 was primarily due to higher revenues net of the cost of energy, driven by these rate increases."", ""Competition for Talent: NiSource faces increased competition for employee and contractor talent in the current labor market, which has resulted in higher costs to attract and retain talent. This challenge is exacerbated by the need for specialized skills to manage new initiatives and organizational changes, highlighting a potential weakness in the company's human capital strategy."", ""Dependency on Regulatory Outcomes: While NiSource has benefited from favorable regulatory outcomes, this dependency also represents a weakness. The company's financial performance is closely tied to the ability to obtain expected financial or regulatory outcomes, which can be uncertain and subject to changes in the regulatory environment."", ""Renewable Energy Projects: NiSource has the opportunity to expand its renewable energy projects, aligning with industry trends and consumer demand for cleaner energy. The company's electric generation transition, including retiring coal-fired generation and replacing it with renewable sources, positions it well for future growth in the green energy sector."", 'Technological Advancements: Advances in technology present an opportunity for NiSource to enhance its operational efficiency and customer service. By embracing new technologies and alternative energy sources, the company can improve its cost structure and adapt to changing market conditions.', ""Economic Fluctuations: NiSource's operations are susceptible to economic fluctuations, including increases in inflation or interest rates and potential recessions. These factors can impact customer demand and the cost of materials and labor, posing a threat to the company's financial stability."", 'Cybersecurity Threats: As NiSource becomes increasingly dependent on technology, the risk of cybersecurity attacks or security breaches grows. The company must invest in robust cybersecurity measures to protect its operations and customer data, which can be a significant financial burden.', ""In conclusion, NiSource Inc (NYSE:NI) exhibits a strong foundation with its strategic infrastructure investments and ability to secure favorable regulatory outcomes. However, challenges in talent acquisition and reliance on regulatory decisions highlight areas for improvement. The company's pursuit of renewable energy projects and technological advancements present significant opportunities for growth, while economic uncertainties and cybersecurity threats require vigilant risk management. Overall, NiSource's strategic positioning and financial health suggest a resilient outlook, with careful navigation of its weaknesses and threats being crucial for sustained success."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

The GARP approach helps identify stocks priced below the market or any suitable target determined by a fundamental analysis.The strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks with impressive prospects and trading at a discount. GARP stocks have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and other metrics.A portfolio based on the GARP strategy comprises stocks that offer the best value and growth investment. ResMed RMD, Booz Allen Hamilton BAH and Kontoor Brands KTB are some GARP stocks that hold promise.', 'The GARP strategy offers ideal investment options utilizing the best value and growth investing features. Investors adopting the GARP approach prefer stocks priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. The stocks have solid prospects based on cash flow, revenues, EPS, etc.Growth MetricsA strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the primary concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a tactic of GARP investors. The GARP strategy considers growth rates between 5% and 20% ideal.Another metric considered by growth and GARP investors is the return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE than the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with a positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing prioritizes one of the popular value metrics — the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. The investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios than value investors but it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. The price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is also taken into consideration.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.', ""Along with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Last five-year EPS & projected 3-5-year EPS growth rates between 5% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (in the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE than the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios are less than the M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than the industry indicate that the stocks are undervalued.)Here are three stocks that made it through the screen:ResMed is a designer, manufacturer, and distributor in the worldwide market for generators, masks and related accessories for the treatment of sleep-disordered breathing and other respiratory disorders.

This report focused on revenue estimates, and it looks as though the consensus view of the business has become substantially more conservative.', ""Following the latest downgrade, the eight analysts covering Occidental Petroleum provided consensus estimates of US$25b revenue in 2024, which would reflect a discernible 7.4% decline on its sales over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are presumed to accumulate 2.5% to US$3.82. Prior to this update, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$30b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$3.85 in 2024. So there's been a clear change in analyst sentiment in the recent update, with the analysts making a measurable cut to revenues and reconfirming their earnings per share estimates."", ' See our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum ', ""Looking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. We would highlight that sales are expected to reverse, with a forecast 9.7% annualised revenue decline to the end of 2024. That is a notable change from historical growth of 13% over the last five years. Compare this with our data, which suggests that other companies in the same industry are, in aggregate, expected to see their revenue grow 2.1% per year. It's pretty clear that Occidental Petroleum's revenues are expected to perform substantially worse than the wider industry."", ""The most obvious conclusion from this consensus update is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times, with analysts holding earnings per share steady, in line with previous estimates.

Higher prices boost its profits, while sinking prices weigh on its earnings. The latter was the case in the first quarter. "", ""However, the oil company sees several catalysts on the horizon that could boost its earnings in the future. Here's a look at its recent quarter and why it's so optimistic about the future. "", 'Occidental Petroleum reported $604 million, or $0.63 per share, of adjusted net income in the first quarter. That was down from the fourth quarter ($710 million or $0.74 per share) and the year-ago period ($1.1 billion or $1.09 per share). ', ""The primary issue was lower oil and gas prices. The company's oil and gas segment reported $1.2 billion of pre-tax income, down from $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter. Occidental sold its oil at an average of $76.04 per barrel in the period, down 4% from the fourth quarter. It also captured a much lower price for its natural gas output (down 14%). "", 'Production was around what it anticipated, at nearly 1.2 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d). That was down slightly from more than 1.2 million BOE/d in the fourth quarter. The company overcame an extended third-party outage in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, thanks to strong production in the Rockies. ', ""The company's oil and gas business delivered muted results in the first quarter, but its other segments were stronger. Occidental's midstream and marketing segment exceeded its guidance for pre-tax income by about $100 million. "", ""Meanwhile, OxyChem's earnings beat the company's expectations by roughly $10 million in the quarter. Occidental capitalized on higher crude margins and improved pricing for some of the chemicals it produces. "", 'Despite lower oil and gas prices, Occidental delivered solid results in the first quarter. It executed well, which enabled it to generate strong cash flow. The company produced over $2.4 billion in operating cash flow and $720 million in free cash flow. While those numbers were down from recent periods, they were solid given the weakness in oil and gas prices. ', 'Even better days could lie ahead. ""We are executing in all areas of our diversified portfolio and positioned for free-cash-flow growth,"" stated CEO Vicki Hollob in the first-quarter earnings release. ', ""The biggest near-term growth catalyst is the company's pending acquisition of CrownRock. Occidental agreed to buy the oil company for $12 billion in December, which will add about 170,000 BOE/d of high-margin oil production. "", ""The company estimates that the CrownRock deal will boost its annual free cash flow by about $1 billion, assuming oil averages $70 per barrel. While crude oil prices are lower this year, they're closer to $80 a barrel these days, suggesting the deal will deliver even more incremental free cash flow. "", 'The company has several additional cash-flow growth drivers. For example, it expects its investment in master limited partnership (MLP) Western Midstream to supply more than $200 million of incremental annual cash distributions starting this year. Western recently optimized its portfolio and capital structure, positioning it to significantly increase its cash distribution. ', ""Meanwhile, contract expirations at Occidental's midstream business will drive sustained cost savings starting next year, boosting its free cash flow. On top of that, OxyChem is investing heavily in expanding its capacity and modernizing some of its facilities. Those investments should start paying off over the next couple of years. "", 'Occidental Petroleum believes it can deliver over $1 billion in incremental annual free cash flow from these segments, which produce steadier cash flow than its oil and gas business. ', ""Occidental's earnings and cash flow declined during the first quarter due to lower oil and gas prices. However, several catalysts could drive an improvement in the future. That upside, especially from its more stable non-oil businesses, makes it a compelling long-term investment opportunity.

A: (Richard A. Jackson - Occidental Petroleum Corporation - Senior VP and President of Operations - U.S. Onshore Resources & Carbon Management) Yes, we are pleased with our first quarter results in both the Rockies and the Permian. For the Permian, we're seeing an implied production increase of about 18,000 barrels a day from the first to the second half of the year while reducing rigs. This is achieved through better operational efficiencies and well design improvements, which also contribute to cost reductions. We're cautious with our full-year guidance as we want to observe how production ramps up in the coming quarters."", ""Q: Regarding the midstream performance, how should we think about its contribution over the next 1.5 to 2 years, especially considering potential constraints on oil and gas movement out of the basin? A: (Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corporation - President, CEO & Director) We don't anticipate issues with moving oil or gas out of the Permian Basin.

We have overcapacity for oil transportation, which allows us to capitalize on third-party barrel opportunities. This setup helps us manage volatility and capture opportunities in the midstream business."", 'Q: Can you discuss the impact of secondary benches in the Permian, particularly in terms of well performance and overall operation?

Jackson - Occidental Petroleum Corporation - Senior VP and President of Operations - U.S. Onshore Resources & Carbon Management) Our focus on subsurface workflows has been applied to secondary benches, leading to impressive performance. This approach is consistent across different areas, whether in the Midland or Delaware basins. In the Rockies, operational improvements have also contributed significantly to performance, with better early and long-term production management.', 'Q: What is the current market perspective on noncore asset sales, and how confident are you in achieving up to $6 billion from these sales? A: (Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corporation - President, CEO & Director) There is high interest in our noncore assets since announcing our divestiture plans.

A: (Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corporation - President, CEO & Director) The agreement reached in Colorado is seen as a win-win, providing a manageable framework for both the industry and the state's environmental goals.

Please take note of the advisory regarding forward-looking statements at the beginning of our slides and in our disclosure, documents filed on SEDAR+ and EDGAR. Following prepared remarks, we will be available to take your questions.I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Brendan McCracken."", 'Brendan Michael McCracken', ""Good morning. Thank you for joining us. Our team has carried our momentum from last year into 2024 with every item at or ahead of our first quarter guidance midpoints. We delivered net earnings of $338 million, free cash flow of $444 million and cash flow per share of $3.80, beating consensus estimates. We've raised our full year production guidance, which will see us deliver oil and condensate volumes of about 206,000 barrels per day, while leaving our capital guide unchanged at $2.3 billion at the midpoint.Our 2024 oil and condensate capital efficiency now reflects a 19% gain compared to our original pre-acquisition 2023 guide. The combination of strong productivity across the portfolio, our leading capital efficiency and stronger oil price environment have raised our expectations for 2024 free cash flow from $1.6 billion to $1.9 billion, roughly $750 million more than last year with similar volumes and less capital spend. This will allow us to deliver enhanced returns to our shareholders and accelerate debt repayment.As we highlighted in February, we also added 65 premium 10,000-foot equivalent locations in the Permian through 3 bolt-on transactions at an average cost of less than $3 million per location. These inventory additions are immediately competitive for capital, and are contiguous with our existing acreage in the core of the Midland Basin.Our multiyear disciplined strategy of both organic and inorganic inventory extension has added about 1,650 premium net 10,000-foot locations to our portfolio, delivering a huge boost to our full cycle returns and the durability of our business. We believe our 2024 program is highly repeatable in 2025 and beyond, reflecting our leading capital efficiency and the depth of our premium inventory.As I mentioned, our strong execution enabled us to meet or beat all our first quarter guidance items. Production during the quarter came in above the midpoint of guidance on all products. Oil and condensate volumes averaged 211,000 barrels per day, with total volumes of 574,000 BOEs per day. We also came in below the midpoint on capital.We resolved the production disruptions we experienced during the quarter, largely due to refinery turnarounds in Salt Lake City as well as some downtime related maintenance that was largely in the Montney. We expect our oil and condensate volumes to stabilize through the second quarter with a more consistent profile in the second half of the year.I'll now turn the call over to Corey."", 'Corey Douglas Code', ""Thanks, Brendan, and good morning. Our track record of shareholder returns continued through the quarter. We returned $328 million through share buybacks of $248 million and base dividends of $80 million. This represents a competitive cash return yield of approximately 8%.Since the inception of our buyback program in the third quarter of 2021, we have repurchased a total of 33 million shares and distributed approximately $700 million in base dividend payments for total shareholder returns of about $2.2 billion.In the second quarter, as per our shareholder returns framework, we will buy back 182 million in shares, and we expect to allocate $182 million to the balance sheet. We remain committed to lowering the overall debt level in our capital structure and the interest costs that go with it.Our strong capital efficiency, combined with higher oil prices, will allow us to reach our $4 billion net debt target sooner. This bolsters the resiliency of our business and positions us to withstand market volatility over the long-term.Our focus in 2024 is to generate superior returns on our invested capital and maximize our free cash flow. Assuming full year average crude prices of $80 WTI oil and a NYMEX natural gas price of $2.25, we expect to generate about $1.9 billion of free cash flow. This is about $750 million or more than 60% higher than last year with similar production volumes.Second quarter production is set to average 560,000 to 575,000 BOEs per day, with oil and condensate volumes of about 207,000 barrels per day at the midpoint. As Brendan mentioned, we expect to deliver a more consistent oil and condensate production profile for the remainder of the year.From a capital investment perspective, the second quarter will be our high point for the year. We added a sixth rig in the Permian at the start of April and we recently commenced our Anadarko drilling program. We expect capital spending to trend down through the second half of the year, and we remain very comfortable with the midpoint of our full year capital guide at $2.3 billion. Our full year TILs are expected to be roughly evenly split between the first and second half of the year.Capital efficiency remains a primary focus for our teams, as we work to efficiently convert our inventory into cash flow and generate consistent durable returns for our shareholders. As a reminder, an additional feature supporting our strong free cash flow this year is the expiry of our REX pipeline commitment here in May, which represents about $100 million in savings versus 2023.Additionally, the recent resolution of a legacy legal matter will result in a onetime recovery of approximately $150 million that will go straight to the balance sheet to reduce debt. Between this and the REX roll off, we'll realize an additional $250 million in the cleanup costs from the legacy business.I'll now turn the call over to Greg, who will speak to our operational highlights."", 'Gregory Dean Givens', ""Thanks, Corey. Across our acreage footprint, our Permian well performance continues to deliver. As planned, Q1 was a relatively lighter quarter for new wells on stream in the Permian with only 17% of our full year turned in lines.On Slide 8, the chart on the right shows our result across the last 2 quarters. The dash line shows all 80 of the wells we brought online over that period. These wells demonstrate the performance of our new completions design across our asset footprint. The green line is our 2024 Permian type curve, unchanged from its introduction in February.As you can see, our performance continues to match the type curve, which incorporates all of the improved well productivity we achieved last year and demonstrates how our team is continuing to innovate to drive returns.We only turned in line 21 wells in the first quarter, but have already turned in line 14 wells in Q2. The performance from these 35 wells as well as our continued solid base performance gave us the confidence to increase our oil and condensate guide for the year to 206,000 barrels per day at the midpoint.Our execution across drilling and completions in the Permian continued to deliver improvements in cycle time, which will ultimately reduce the number of days on looking and lower costs.On the drilling side, our average drilling speed in the first quarter was roughly 5% faster than our 2023 program. As Corey mentioned, we recently added a sixth rig in the Permian. With respect to completions, our year-to-date Trimulfrac wells were completed 30% faster than our average speed in 2023 at an industry-leading 4,200 feet per day.We expect to utilize Trimulfrac on more than half of our program this year. This approach yields a 15% savings in completions cost per foot and essentially doubles the completed feet per day versus a traditional zipper frac. We have deep experience with Trimulfrac, having completed nearly 70 wells in more than 3,400 stages since we began deploying the technique over 2 years ago.We are also seeing industry-leading drilling and completion metrics in the Montney, where in the first quarter, we delivered an average of 1,750 feet drilled per day and over 4,100 feet completed per day. These results are in line with our Permian pacesetters and demonstrate the value of our culture of innovation and multi-basin portfolio to deliver learnings and transfer learnings in real-time.Despite the current weakness in gas prices, the economics on our Montney wells remain outstanding. Assuming $75 WTI and $2.50 NYMEX gas, we expect our Montney to generate a program level IRR of more than 60%. These returns are driven by our superior well productivity, low well costs and strong price realizations for both condensate, which generate -- which generally trades in line with WTI as well as natural gas.In fact, our Montney gas realized 103% of NYMEX in Q1 on an unhedged basis. This is the result of our physical transportation arrangements to markets in Eastern Canada Chicago, California and the Pacific Northwest. Our Montney program remains robust in both BC and Alberta as we have in hand, all of the permits needed to execute our 2024 plan and 100% of our water needs secured. Our performance in the play continues to demonstrate the expertise of our team and maximizing value from this incredible resource.In the Uinta, our continued focus on well cost reductions makes the play highly competitive in our portfolio as it generates a margin similar to our Permian operations. Our large contiguous land base of approximately 137,000 net acres has multiple benches across 1,000 feet of collective pay. It is greater than 80% undeveloped, which translates into a significant inventory runway.As Brendan mentioned earlier, the refinery turnarounds in Salt Lake City were completed at the end of the first quarter, allowing us to bring constrained production back online and return the local refining complex at our typical rates.Furthermore, our rail capacity to the Gulf Coast diversifies market exposure and supports future growth in the play. With our first quarter drilling program complete, we will continue to on getting the majority of our 2024 wells online through the second quarter.Moving to the Anadarko. Our 2024 drilling program commenced at the beginning of April. We are targeting the oiliest parts of our acreage to leverage the strong oil performance we saw in 2023, where the wells displayed first year oil cuts of more than 55%, with about 85% of first year revenue coming from oil.We plan to run 1 rig in the play for the remainder of the year and expect to see our first wells come online in the third quarter. The team has also managed our base production very effectively and we expect our 2024 Anadarko base decline rate to average an impressive 17%.I'll now turn the call back to Brendan."", 'Brendan Michael McCracken', ""Thanks, Greg. Our team delivered another strong quarter, meeting or beating all our targets, and delivering cash flow per share and free cash flow above consensus. Our focus remains on maximizing capital efficiency, generating significant free cash flow, reducing debt and continuing to bolster our premium return drilling inventory. We are well positioned to deliver consistent durable returns to our shareholders through our focus on operational excellence, disciplined capital and responsible operations.This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we're now ready to open the line for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Question comes from Neil Mehta at Goldman Sachs.', 'Neil Singhvi Mehta', ""A couple of questions for you. First, I would love your perspective, we spent a lot of time talking about the Permian over the last couple of quarters. But on the Montney specifically, and the progress you're making in the oil window. So if you could just spend some time talking about your plans for that over the course of the year, and what do you think that investors should be focused on from a strategic perspective there?"", 'Brendan Michael McCracken', ""Yes. Thanks, Neil. Really appreciate it. And where I'll start first is just with the resource itself. And I think this is a place that's getting more attention from our investors, but one of the things we've been flagging for a little while now is the -- everybody knows the Permian is the largest remaining premium oil resource in North America. And I think what a lot of people haven't realized until recently is the second largest remaining oil resource in North America is in the Montney, and it's sort of largely been thought of as more of a gas play. But where we've been focusing our capital and focusing our attention in the play has been on our acreage that's in the condensate window, which for us sells as a premium product and really prices just like our oil price in the U.S.And so that's been the strategic focus for us. And look, we're really pleased with the results. I think it's very consistent with our durable return strategy where we've built a culture and expertise that lets us leading on innovation and that showing up in both our cost and our productivity performance in the play. And as we run the business at a maintenance level as a company, that's the role that the Montney is playing within the portfolio. So investors should expect it to run relatively flat through the year and deliver free cash flow off the back of that."", 'Neil Singhvi Mehta', ""Okay. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up. We've got some questions this morning on just 2Q capital. It is a little bit higher than what would be implied for the full year. I'm guessing that's just lumpiness with the sixth rig coming up and the Anadarko kicking off, but just any perspective on just timing of CapEx in Q2?"", 'Brendan Michael McCracken', 'Yes, you got it, for sure, Neil. The sixth rig is part of that. And then we highlighted the TIL cadence, the turn-in-line cadence across the portfolio being a little lighter in 1Q and a little stronger in 2Q. And so where that will set us up is, if you look at it on a first half, second half basis as a company would be almost balanced on that capital and turn-in-line cadence, but a little bit shaded towards Q2 relative to Q1.', 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Arun Jayaram at JPMorgan.', 'Arun Jayaram', ""Corey, I'm wondering if you could just maybe elaborate on the $150 million expected cash inflow, it looks like you resolved a previous asset sale dispute, but maybe some details on that and maybe perhaps timing and any tax implications from that inflow?"", 'Corey Douglas Code', ""Yes. Just based on the agreement, we're not allowed to say a whole bunch more about it other than I can confirm it's a very old transaction. We should have minimal cash tax with it. And then maybe the only other clarifying point would be it's not going to show up in cash flow. So the full amount of it's going to go to reduce debt in the second half of the year."", 'Brendan Michael McCracken', ""And Arun, the only thing I'd add to it, we're very pleased to get this one resolved. As Corey said, it's an older item, not a recent one. And think generally, what that should reflect is the relentlessness that our team has to get value for our shareholders.And when you think about the $150 million from this settlement, combined with the work to roll off the REX payment this year, which actually is this month is our final REX payment owing that's almost $300 million or maybe call it, closer to $250 million of incremental value to the shareholders. And our team is just relentless about trying to unearth those opportunities and bring them all the way to the bottom line."", 'Arun Jayaram', 'Yes. Just to clarify, do you have a sense of timing? Is that a 2Q item, or is that second half of the year?', 'Corey Douglas Code', ""It will be second half. It's right around third, fourth quarter."", 'Arun Jayaram', ""Okay. Fair enough. My follow-up is just on the Trimulfrac completion scheme. Greg, I think you mentioned you participated now in 70 completions, but one of the questions we've got from investors is if you could give us a sense of the well productivity on the Trimulfrac completions versus the wells you're doing, either Simulfrac or zipper. And is there any trade-off before some of the -- that you're experiencing from some of the efficiency gains versus just overall performance or well productivity?"", 'Gregory Dean Givens', ""Thanks for the question. And we've been very pleased that all along over the past 2 years, as we've instituted these Trimulfrac's, we're seeing no degradation of well performance really at all. What we're seeing is lower treating pressures and the ability to pump these jobs faster, which should generates cost savings, which will flow straight to the bottom line. It also allows us to execute these jobs faster, which allows us to be more capital efficient. But the performance from these wells are very much in line with the other wells in the field.If you recall, we were doing this for a bit of time prior to even divulging that we were doing Trimulfrac and the results weren't showing up any differently during that time, and that continues to be the case today. So we're very pleased with Trimulfrac. We pump 1/3 of our jobs last year using that technique, this year will be a little over half. And I see no reason why we couldn't continue to push that up even higher in the future as we continue to use the technology."", 'Brendan Michael McCracken', ""Yes. I'd just add Arun. I'd just add Arun, in the rock doesn't know it's being Trimulfraced. So the way we design these completions, the rate of slurry sand and water that's going through each cluster is exactly the same in either a zipper, a Simul or a Trimulfrac. And so really, this is all about an aboveground efficiency gain and the reservoir feels the exact same frac it would otherwise.So that's why the result that Greg is describing on the well performance makes total sense that the wells would produce exactly the same because the completion downhole is exactly the same."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Neal Dingmann at Truist Securities.', 'Neal David Dingmann', ""My first question is on the D&C plan. Specifically, looking at your -- I guess, the second quarter guide, you all talked about adding that sixth Permian rig is -- I know you'd -- I already said suggested and started up the Anadarko program. I'm just wondering assuming you're maybe -- I don't know, Brendan question for you or Greg, if the operational efficiencies continue at this current pace, would you all continue with the same rigs, the 6 same rigs or which I think is about 60% the overall program? Or would you let maybe a Permian rig, or another rig go earlier than expected in the program this year?"", 'Brendan Michael McCracken', ""Yes, Neal, I think the way to think about that is based on what we're seeing today in terms of supply and demand fundamentals and the service price environment that we're working in, we're biased towards keeping that low-level program going with that sixth rig through the end of the year. And so that's what's reflected in the guidance that we issued today and additional asset level guidance in the material also shows that -- with that 60% of the TILs in the Permian coming in the second half."", 'Neal David Dingmann', 'Got it. Got it. Okay. And then just a quick -- do you have some, Greg.', 'Gregory Dean Givens', 'No, go ahead, Neal.', 'Neal David Dingmann', ""Okay. Then just a quick second one, just on capital allocation. Is it fair to say -- I don't know, Brendan, for your record, just when you look at the free cash flow, and we have that continuing to ramp up pretty nicely this year. Will that likely continue to consist of just -- continue to lean -- leaning into buybacks of the stocks or -- I'm just wondering, I guess, that versus variables or something else or if I could ask maybe one other second part of there. I mean do you all think of the stock value is based on a mid-cycle level, or what would cause you to continue leaning into this as you have?"", 'Brendan Michael McCracken', ""Yes. Great question, Neal. The approach we've taken, I think, will continue to be consistent with. And our view there has been to stay in this 50-50 allocation of free cash, where we're putting half of it to the debt reduction and then half of it to the incremental shareholder returns.And then on your question around how to do that incremental shareholder return, we continue to see buybacks as the right value choice and the way we get to it is exactly how you implied. So we look at what we think the intrinsic value of the business is, and we look at that through a mid-cycle lens. And for us, that's been $55 on TI (sic) [WTI] and $2.75 on NYMEX. And so we look at the business through that price lens, which sitting here today feels reasonably conservative on the oil side and probably balanced on the gas side.And so we like that as a discipline tactic to really manage that decision between staying in buybacks or shifting into something like a variable dividend. And so when we do that math and analysis, today, we're still very comfortable that the buybacks are the right return mechanism to choose for that incremental return to our shareholders."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Gabe Daoud at TD Cowen.', 'Gabriel J. Daoud', ""It's Gabe here from Cowen. Brendan, I was hoping maybe you could just provide a little bit more on the trajectory from here? You assume you get 8 KBD back in the Uinta and Permian tills, kind of accelerating from here with 60% in the back half. You're starting a rig in the Anadarko. Is Montney, I guess, declining still on the condensate basis? How do we think about that, I guess? And just some of the puts and takes at the asset level versus the corporate level guide that kind of assumes or implies maybe flattish to down in the second half on oil and condensate."", 'Brendan Michael McCracken', ""Yes. Maybe I can talk a little bit about the shape within the assets there, Gabe. So remember, the kind of the biggest factor for production shape for us this year has been really finishing off the integration of that acquisition in the Permian last year. And just as a reminder, I think everybody knows this, but just as a reminder, there was quite a number of wells in progress that we inherited there as we shifted from that asset being run for growth under the prior management to being run for free cash flow under our strategy.And so really, the shape that you're seeing through '24 is just finishing off that stabilization and integration. And so what you should expect is the Permian will stabilize in the back half of the year at a little under where it was in 1Q. Montney will be fairly flat through the year. Uinta grows a little bit more and Anadarko fairly flat to slightly down through the year until we start to bring on those wells in the second half."", 'Gabriel J. Daoud', ""Okay. Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then I guess as a follow-up, you did $190 million or so, I guess, in bolt-ons in 1Q. Just curious what the sites like for continued bolt-ons and if we should expect maybe that similar level of spend the rest of the year? Or do you think the $190 million is kind of it for this year?"", 'Brendan Michael McCracken', ""Yes. I think the thing to think about there is we've done a lot in this space over the last several years, and we've updated that outcome with the 1,650 net premium inventory additions that we've made over that time. And it was a combination of the smaller bolt-ons, like the ones that you referenced that we did earlier in 1Q, and then the larger transaction in the Permian last year and our organic efforts, right, converting nonpremium locations to premium on our existing acreage.And so look, I think that puts in a spot today where -- we're keeping it very opportunistic. We're not driven to have to transact in order to extend our inventory. We've got that in place. And so it lets us be very value-oriented and disciplined in the market that we're seeing today.And I think we'll stay opportunistic though. And when we see opportunities like we saw in 1Q to go grab some really high-quality inventory that bolts rate on to our existing acreage, we'll continue to do that, but we'll balance that with our ambitions on debt reduction and we'll be disciplined about value creation."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Scott Gruber of Citigroup.', 'Scott Andrew Gruber', ""Just following up on the Permian rig count question. Given the efficiency gains, I'm curious, the Permian rig count of 6 equivalent with a modest level of growth out of the asset relative to where it's going to stabilize in the second half?"", 'Brendan Michael McCracken', ""Well, I think that will be a '25 question, really, Scott, because today, what we're doing is, like I said, integrating that higher WIP activity that we inherited and whether that's leaving us is with the guidance that you've got there for both the company and the asset. And really the question around is 5 or 6 the maintenance level, that will be a '25 question that will come to as we get through the year.And really, what we're honoring there is the rate of change that the team is continuing to drive like as we just drill faster and complete faster. So we'll get a read on that as we get through the rest of the year and update that view for '25 when we get there."", 'Scott Andrew Gruber', 'Okay. And then just circling back on the $150 million gain on the resolution. Just checking, you guys will receive $150 million in cash in the second half. Is that correct? And how do we think about that in terms of cash distributions or that cash going to the balance sheet?', 'Brendan Michael McCracken', ""Yes. Yes, Scott, really appreciate the clarification. That is correct. So that's $150 million in cash coming to us. It will not be a cash flow item. And so our intention is to put that directly to debt reduction."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Greg Pardy at RBC Capital Markets.', 'Greg M. Pardy', ""I want to maybe just build a little on the balance sheet question. So that's -- the $150 million paydown is helpful. Corey, you had what -- I think a working capital headwind of $376 million or so in the first quarter bits. Do you expect some of that to unwind through the year. The bigger question is where is most of the progress made in the deleveraging getting to the $4 billion? Is that really -- is that predominantly going to be 2025 as you look at it?"", 'Brendan Michael McCracken', ""Yes. I'll let Corey chime in here, Greg. But really, the progress is the free cash generation from the business, driving debt down. But I'll turn it to Corey."", 'Corey Douglas Code', ""Yes, Greg. We'll start to see progress even as we get through the first quarter because we put that debt bridge in the appendix as to help people see some of these onetime items in the first quarter. So those included the bolt-ons here that were previously mentioned plus the actual cash payment of the 2023 tax bill for us. So our business will generate more free cash flow really starting in April after the first quarter and the debt starts to come down, and obviously accelerates as oil's 80-plus. So we'll start to see progress this year we don't know, we have to wait until 2025 to see that."", 'Greg M. Pardy', ""Okay. And then maybe just related, how are you thinking about your hedging program, particularly as the balance sheet continues to deleverage, is hedging something that you could see really moving away from? Or is that something you'd want to stay involved with no matter what?"", 'Brendan Michael McCracken', ""Yes. I think -- so the -- maybe I'll talk about the current state and then talk about the future. So really, what we've been doing with our hedging program is protecting the business against a long period of very low prices. And so with that has resulted in is us hedging on a quarterly basis about a year out in time, and hedging a brown 1/4 of production on both the gas and oil fronts. And with that will let us do is withstand a period of pricing as low as 40 on the oil and 2 on the gas, and still be free cash flow neutral or better after the base dividend. That's been kind of the principle of what we've been doing.And so as the debt comes down, I think there's kind of 2 things that happened. One, the interest expense comes down and so that balancing point on free cash flow neutrality is enhanced. And then the other is kind of your question, which is do you even feel the need to hedge at all. And I think that's something that we'll just continue to address as we work towards that debt reduction. But the direction of travel is as you suggested, which is as the business delevers the need hedge goes down."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Roger Read at Wells Fargo.', 'Roger David Read', ""Just really wanted to follow-up on, I guess, kind of thinking about it in the portfolio side. You've got a nice collection of assets here. You've obviously done some modest acquisitions. Is there anything at this point that it makes more sense to kind of put on the back burner potentially monetize as a way to accelerate debt repayment?"", 'Brendan Michael McCracken', ""Yes, Roger, I appreciate the question. Look, what we've done is built a portfolio that can be competitive for capital in every asset that we have. And so you can see from the capital allocation across the portfolio, the 2 biggest places where we're allocating capital are our 2 biggest assets, so this is kind of no surprise, the Permian and the Montney.But our returns that we're generating in the other 2 assets that Uinta and the Anadarko are very competitive for capital. And so we could move a rig around the portfolio and not have a change in corporate return. And that's been how we've designed and sort of trimmed the portfolio over the years is to have exactly that multi-basin portfolio where everything is competitive for capital.So I think that's what you should expect. I think we're excited about each of the assets in the portfolio and what our teams are doing to generate free cash flow and capital efficiency gains in each of them."", 'Operator', 'And the next question comes from Geoff Jay at Daniel Energy Partners.', 'Brendan Michael McCracken', 'Go ahead, Geoff, if your there. I think we might have lost him, operator.', 'Geoff Jay', 'My question is really about the multiyear outlook for the Montney. I guess, given the Trans Mountain expansion, obviously, conde is tight right now, and I wonder kind of how you sort of think about the incremental pool for condensate going forward and what the opportunity set is for you to either grow that asset or at least get maybe even better pricing up there?', 'Brendan Michael McCracken', ""Yes, Geoff, I appreciate the question. And this has been a dynamic that our teams follow very closely for quite a number of years, and our view has always been that the Montney condensate will stay a premium product and that view is really just informed by how the marginal pricing is being set. So today, the Canadian market is about 50% domestic short on condensate. So around half of the demand is actually being imported into the basin. And that's the price setting mechanism that creates the premium pricing that you're referring to.And so as the oil sands producers expand brownfield projects and get more market access, that just exacerbates that net shortage of domestic condensate supply. And so we see the fundamentals continuing to be strong there for years and years to come. And that's been the strategy of how we've deployed capital into the play is to chase that premium priced barrels.So -- and then to your question on growth, really, our Montney plan as it stands is maintenance level because as a company, we're a maintenance level. And so that's the role that, that asset has been fulfilling in the portfolio. But as we've highlighted over the recent years, we have the ability to modestly grow that if there is a market call for that growth."", 'Geoff Jay', ""That's super helpful."", 'Operator', 'At this time, we have completed the question-and-answer session. I will turn the call back over to Mr. Verhaest.', 'Jason Verhaest', 'Thanks, Joanna, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call today. This call is now complete.', 'Operator', 'Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference for today. We thank you for participating, and we ask that you please disconnect your lines.']"

I'll now turn the call over to Vicki."", 'Vicki Hollub -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Thank you, Jordan, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report on a strong start to 2024 driven by our persistent focus on operational execution. As we will detail in today's call, our oil and gas business delivered robust production results, essentially offsetting an extended third-party outage, while our Midstream and OxyChem businesses outperformed our first-quarter guidance. Today, I'll start by discussing our first-quarter performance, including highlighting our Delaware appraisal success and its contribution to Permian's development runway."", ""Then I'll discuss what's on the horizon for Oxy and how these initiatives are expected to generate significant value for our shareholders. Operational excellence is fundamental to everything we do at Oxy, and our capabilities were evident during the first quarter as our teams generated over $2.4 billion in operating cash flow before working capital. Though the third-party outage in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico made it a challenging start to the year, our teams delivered excellent performance in all areas of our portfolio. We concluded the first quarter by approximating the midpoint of our production guidance, and we restarted production from our Gulf of Mexico platforms affected by the outage in mid-April."", ""Taking a closer look at our production results, the first quarter benefited from strong new well performance in the Permian Basin and the Rockies, overcoming the impact of winter weather early in the year. In the Permian, we exceeded the midpoint of our production guidance due in part to better-than-expected secondary bench performance in the Delaware Basin. Our Delaware teams are achieving impressive performance results by applying the same proprietary subsurface workflows that have generated remarkable success in our primary benches and applying that to secondary benches. Through utilization of fit-for-purpose well design and reservoir characterization expertise, performance in our secondary benches is nearly matching Oxy's record-setting 2023 program average."", ""Not only that, first-year cumulative production from Oxy's 2023 secondary wells exceeds the Delaware industry average for all horizontal wells for the same period by more than 30%. We are driving financial returns for our shareholders by improving our ability to high-grade our near-term inventory and by extending our runway of tier-one locations. Meanwhile, use of our existing infrastructure yields meaningful capital efficiencies. We expect these efficiency benefits to become more impactful as secondary benches become a more substantial part of our development program."", 'Our Rockies asset outperformed the high end of our first-quarter production guidance, partly driven by strong new well performance in the DJ Basin, better production uptime, higher than expected outside operating volumes. And then internationally, we achieved record gross daily production in Oman North driven by new well performance and production uptime. Our teams continue to improve capital efficiency through a combination of innovative well design, exceptional execution, proactive supply chain, and management practices. In the DJ and Powder River Basins, our teams optimized casing and cementing plans, completion stage design, and profit utilization.', ""These fit-for-purpose well design enhancements resulted in tangible first-quarter well cost reductions of between $700,000 and $1 million per well, compared to the first half of last year. We're also starting to see cost reduction progress in the Delaware Basin. Our continuous drive for improvement not only leads to innovations that increase operational efficiencies, but in many instances, we're also able to reduce emissions and advance progress toward our net zero goals. I'm proud of our team's involvement in another oil and gas industry first, the deployment of a fully electric well service rig."", ""Oxy and Axis Energy Services deployed the first-of-its-kind rig into our Permian Basin operation. Expanding electrification is integral to Oxy's strategy because it increases operational efficiency, generates cost savings, improves safety, and helps reduce our emissions. Our midstream business significantly outperformed the high end of our guidance for the first quarter. Our performance was partly driven by gas marketing optimization across our portfolio where our teams captured value in regional pricing disparities."", ""Warmer than expected weather combined with various third-party midstream infrastructure maintenance resulted in disjointed prices in some regions. Midstream's first-quarter performance demonstrates how our teams realized value from these pricing abnormalities by leveraging Oxy's rich market intelligence along with our product storage and transportation portfolio. Looking back over multiple quarters, our marketing teams have frequently demonstrated the ability to outperform with our transportation optimization capabilities playing a major role. Over the longer term, we anticipate similar marketing opportunities, but we generally exclude those opportunities from our guidance because of the difficulty in predicting event occurrence."", 'Not only does our midstream business provide us with flow assurance for our marketed products, it also offers great diversification during periods of commodity price volatility as we saw in early 2024. Along with being one of the top performers for the products it manufactures, OxyChem is a consistent cash flow diversifier within our business due in part to its renowned focus on operational efficiency. During the first quarter, OxyChem benefited from improved demand from our marketed products, including PVC and vinyl chloride, as well as lower ethylene costs. This performance demonstrates how our diversified asset portfolio is well-positioned to deliver financial results for our shareholders throughout the commodity cycle.', ""In prior calls, we have reiterated our drive to increase value for our investors on an absolute and per-share basis through cash flow and earnings growth. Today, I'd like to provide an update on the specific projects that we mentioned in our last quarterly call. Some aspects of the OxyChem plant enhancement projects are complete, but there is more to be done, including the battleground project where the team held a ground-breaking ceremony on April 4th to kick off the site work. Employees, contractors, community partners, city leaders, and elected officials attended in support of the project."", 'The completion of the OxyChem projects and reductions in crude oil and transportation rates from the Permian to the Gulf Coast are expected to deliver incremental cash flow of approximately $725 million per year. In our midstream business, we expect that our ownership stake in Western Midstream, or WES, will also enhance our financial results. In February, WES announced an increase of over 50% to their distribution. Based on the current distribution, we anticipate that WES will contribute over $240 million of additional cash flow per year to Oxy.', 'Additionally, we intend to increase free cash flow by repaying debt as it matures. Repayment of existing debt maturities through 2026 will result in approximately $180 million of annualized incremental cash flow from interest savings that can then be applied to further strengthen our balance sheet. Overall, we expect more than $1 billion of cash flow improvements that are independent of commodity cycles. That figure does not include our oil and gas business, which is also poised for continued financial success.', ""As most of you know, at the end of last year, we entered into an agreement to strategically enhance our Midland Basin portfolio for the acquisition of CrownRock. The free cash flow accretion and portfolio high grading to be enabled by the CrownRock acquisition are expected to provide the potential for equity appreciation and acceleration of our shareholder return priorities. At our low carbon ventures businesses, we expect to generate cash flow detached from oil and gas, price volatility, and further strengthen Oxy's cash flow resiliency. Construction of our first direct air capture plant, STRATOS, is advancing on schedule, and during the first quarter, we were pleased to announce a multitude of carbon dioxide removal credit agreements with customers across a variety of sectors."", ""Throughout Oxy's portfolio, we are focused on expanding resilient cash flow and enhancing shareholder value for decades to come. I will now hand the call over to Sunil, who will cover our financial results and guidance."", 'Sunil Mathew -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', 'Thank you, Vicki. In the first quarter of 2024, we generated an adjusted profit of $0.63 per diluted share and a reported profit of $0.75 per diluted share. The difference between adjusted and reported profit was primarily driven by a litigation settlement gain related to the Andes arbitration and gains on sales included in equity income, partially offset by derivative losses. We exited the first quarter with nearly $1.3 billion of unrestricted cash.', 'We had a negative working capital change, which is typical for the first quarter and is largely due to semi-annual interest payments on our debt, annual property tax payments, and payments under our compensation plans. During the first quarter, we delivered over $700 million of free cash flow before working capital, despite third-party outage impacts to portions of our oily, high-margin production in the Gulf of Mexico. First-quarter free cash flow was underpinned by outperformance in our onshore domestic portfolio and our midstream and OxyChem segments. Looking ahead to the second quarter, total company production is expected to increase to a range of 1.23 million to 1.27 million BOE per day, compared to the first-quarter annual low of 1.17 million BOE per day.', 'The midpoint of second-quarter production guidance will be the highest quarterly production in over three years. The production increase is mainly due to U.S. onshore activity levels, the completion of annual plant maintenance at Dolphin, and the return of production in mid-April from the Gulf of Mexico outage. Our second-quarter Gulf of Mexico production guidance includes third-party outage impacts in April, as well as plant maintenance in the Central Gulf of Mexico.', 'Though we revised fully a Gulf of Mexico production guidance down as a result of the extended outage, it is fully offset by outperformance in the Rockies, and we are maintaining our total company production guidance for the year. The modified production mix is expected to impact annual total company oil cut. We had a strong start to 2024 in our chemicals business and anticipate modest price improvements during the second quarter, combined with higher volumes as we exit the usual period of seasonal subdued demand. Though lower gas prices are unfavorable elsewhere in our portfolio, OxyChem benefits from reduced energy costs and our midstream teams are well-positioned to capitalize on the gas marketing opportunities that Vicki highlighted.', ""Solid outperformance enabled us to raise midstream's fully guidance range by $110 million. Oxy's first-quarter performance demonstrates the benefits of a differentiated portfolio. Our diversified assets and distinguished operational capabilities offer our shareholders cash flow resiliency throughout the commodity cycle. In terms of capital spending, our first-quarter results were in alignment with the 2024 business plan and the capital program that is weighted toward the first half of the year."", ""On the last earnings call, we stated that approximately 40% of Rocky's capital for the year is associated with built and uncompleted wells, or ducts, carried in from 2023. We intend to continue completing these wells and reduce duct inventory through the first half of the year. Similarly, Permian capital is weighted toward the first half of the year due to working interest variability and the desire to high-grade rigs and increase utilization rates into the second half of the year. This U.S."", ""onshore capital profile, combined with Battleground Project ramp-up, is expected to result in second quarter being the highest quarterly capital for the year. I would like to close today by touching on the CrownRock acquisition. Our teams are working constructively with the FTC, and we anticipate that the transaction will close in the third quarter of this year. As a reminder, Oxy will benefit from CrownRock's activity between the transaction's January 1st, 2024 effective date and close, subject to customary purchase price adjustments."", ""Concurrent with the CrownRock acquisition, we announced a $4.5 billion to $6 billion divestiture program to be completed within 18 months of the transaction's close. The high-quality assets within our portfolio have garnered much interest, and our teams have commenced the early stages of the divestiture process. Sales proceeds will be applied to deleveraging until we reduce our principal debt to $15 billion or below. The near-term cash flow enhancements that Vicki highlighted are expected to deliver significant free cash flow growth per diluted share for our common shareholders and to enable us to accelerate the achievement of our debt target."", ""After our debt target is met, we intend to resume our share repurchase program and provide even greater value per common share. As we have discussed on today's call, we are well-positioned to build on a strong first quarter of 2024 and deliver a differentiated, long-term value proposition to our shareholders. I will now turn the call back over to Vicki."", 'Vicki Hollub -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you, Sunil. Before we move to Q&A, I want to tell you about a milestone our team celebrated last quarter. Oxy began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on March 3rd, 1964. On that day, our operations consisted of 252 oil and gas wells in six states.', ""Today, we're an international energy, chemicals, and carbon management company with the best portfolio in our history. But I believe that Oxy's employees are a true differentiator. Their expertise and drive to outperform continue to stretch the limits of what is achievable in our industry. Our employees are hard at work executing our strategy through superior operations and best-in-class assets."", ""Their efforts result in long-term shareholder value, and I look forward to showcasing more of their achievements on future calls. With that, we'll now open the call for questions. And as a reminder, as Jordan mentioned, Richard Jackson and Ken Dillon are with us today for the Q&A session."", '', 'Operator', '[Operator instructions] The first question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.', 'Roger Read -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', ""Yeah. Thank you, and good afternoon. I'd like to, if we could, maybe just dig in a little bit more on the Permian outlook here, probably including the Rockies. Maybe let's just call it the lower 48."", ""If we look at the capex and then we look at the forecast for the full year, I'm just a little curious why you didn't get a little more optimistic about total volumes. I recognize that within the year-over-year changes, we're looking at a little more EOR, maybe a little less shale wells. I was wondering if that's part of the difference we're seeing or maybe why we don't see production raised as well."", 'Vicki Hollub -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Richard?', 'Richard Jackson -- President, Operations, U.S. Onshore Resources and Carbon Management', 'Yeah. Thanks, Roger. Appreciate the question. Clearly, very pleased with our first-quarter results coming out of both the Rockies and the Permian.', ""Both had a beat on the quarter with Permian looking good on several fronts. I'll focus there first. I guess a couple of things just to kind of anchor the year on. As we think about going from first quarter to the second quarter, which Sunil mentioned, quite a big step up in terms of production."", ""But even looking at first half versus second half in the Permian, the implied increase is about 18,000 barrels a day, first half to second half. We're doing that while reducing rigs for in the Permian. We're getting more with less in terms of how we think about activity. Some of that plays through on the capital, as you mentioned, as we're a bit front load heavy both on rigs but also facilities as we're front loading the facilities in the first half of the year to take on that production increase starting next quarter."", ""The good news is things are performing well. When you look at the year and you think about the trajectory we're going on with things that are meaningful to our business, we highlight the new well production, not only the primary zones, which we've highlighted over the last couple of years, but now this quarter we really wanted to highlight the success of the secondary benches that play a meaningful role in our portfolio for the year. The other thing that we don't talk enough about is base decline. If you look at our Permian resources this year, we're improving our base decline from last year about 4% to 5%."", ""That's around 15,000 barrels a day. That's really come through not only better wells but a lot better operations. Our uptime is improving 1% to 2% in places like the Delaware. As we thought about full-year guidance, we certainly appreciated the results in the first quarter, but we wanted to see how this plays out over this steep production increase over the next couple of quarters."", ""Look forward to updating our milestones on progress to that. The last thing I would just say is behind that, as you think about capital, we are seeing capital efficiency. We highlighted some of the well cost improvements both in the Rockies and the Permian. I'm very pleased with our team's progress there."", ""That's being done through strong approaches with our service companies but also through well-design changes, which we noted. As we put that together, we look at this total year production versus capital. Our capital intensity this year has improved over last year, which is the goal. What we're spending dollars, millions of dollars per production added has improved year on year."", ""We'll stay focused on that. Look forward to more updates as we go this year to help put that piece together for our total year outlook."", 'Roger Read -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', ""OK. Appreciate that. I guess the other question I had, you talked about it on the intro there, Vicki, but the performance of the midstream. How much of that is something that we ought to think about as we're going to go forward over the next year and a half, two years? We'll have another period where we're probably constrained on being able to move oil and gas out of the base."", 'Just maybe a way to think about other opportunities coming forward for you all to capture a little bit better.', 'Vicki Hollub -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""For us, we don't have an issue moving oil or gas out of the Permian Basin. In fact, some of the positive impacts for our midstream performance are due to the fact that from a gas perspective, we have capacity elsewhere so that we can move molecules around too and trade molecules. We have ways to get gas to California and to other markets. From a gas marketing perspective, we're in really good shape and take away capacity in good shape there."", ""Oil, we're also in good shape. We have over capacity now to get barrels out of the Permian. When we talk about fluctuations in the midstream business with respect to crude marketing, normally some of that's associated with picking up the third-party barrels that are associated with the capacity that we need to fill with incremental barrels above and beyond our current production. That's the volatility mostly in the midstream business."", ""That along with the gas marketing does cause volatility, but normally that volatility is to the upside for us because of the fact that, as I just mentioned, we have the capability to move things around and to take advantage of situations where others are disadvantaged. While with WAHA, in the situation that it's in now, our upstream realizations are lower, but our midstream business is able to capture opportunity to offset that."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.', 'Paul Cheng -- Scotiabank -- Analyst', ""Thank you. Good morning. Vicki, or maybe, Richard, in Delaware, you're talking about the secondary branches, I think it's the Bone Spring. Is it widespread throughout your entire operation or specifically in certain counties? Is there any kind of characteristic that you can see in terms of the pattern that will lead to this really strong performance in wells from those branches or those areas? We're trying to understand how important it is to your overall operation or your overall inventory level."", 'Secondly, your DJ has been performing really well. It has been beating your own guidance for a number of quarters, at least for seven or eight quarters already. From that standpoint, your current estimate may be a little bit conservative for the remaining of the year in the DJ. Also, what are the primary reasons for the outperformance there? Thank you.', 'Richard Jackson -- President, Operations, U.S. Onshore Resources and Carbon Management', ""Thanks, Paul. I'll start in the Permian and get to the Rockies. I think the way we describe sort of our approach to primary benches and then it's turned into our secondary benches is really unique by area. We spend a lot of time, and we've talked about it in the past, really focused on the subsurface aspects, both from a geologic perspective and then as you think about it over time, from a reservoir perspective."", ""I think as we've continued to delineate and be more broad in terms of the zones that we put together in areas, we focus on how do we put these wells in space together in the subsurface to optimize that recovery. Of course, your stimulation design and these other factors play an important role. I don't think it's unique by area. I think it's the same approach that we've delivered in terms of the Midland Basin with the success we've had in the Barnett, what we're doing in the Delaware Basin, whether it's Upper Bone Springs or deeper Wolf Camp."", ""I think as we think about the Rockies, the same sort of approach there. In terms of the Rockies, they've had great performance over the last year plus. A lot of that started with this subsurface approach where we really spent time thinking about how do we approach lateral length, spacing, stimulation intensity. I think a lot of the early gains we were seeing there, I think what we're seeing today is a lot more operational."", ""We talk about how do we draw these wells down, so early time flow back and then longer term. What we're seeing is really improvements in both. In the early time performance, it's really having the facilities and the emissions handling to do that, not only at a correct rate, but to handle the emissions. Then long term, we've talked about the base recovery with things like our plunger lift assist AI."", ""These type of things are really what delivered the overperformance. I wish I could say it was conservative. I just think they've improved so much. When you're improving better than 20% year on year, that's sometimes tough to outlook."", ""I think they've gotten more mature in terms of some of these advancements over the last year. I think we've done a lot better job sort of narrowing the uncertainty of those outlooks. All the teams are still on the hook to outperform this year. We're optimistic, like I answered earlier, in terms of what we're doing in the Permian as well."", 'I appreciate the question. Hopefully, that helps.', 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.', 'Neil Mehta -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', 'Thank you, team. Thanks for the color so far. My first question is just around non-core asset sales, recognizing we still have some time before the deal closes. I would imagine you continue to have conversations around the divestments.', ""I'm just curious what your perspective is on the market right now and your confidence in the achievability of up to the $6 billion of non-core asset sales that many have anchored to."", 'Vicki Hollub -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""There's a lot of incoming interest. Once we announced that we were going to divest between $4.5 billion and $6 billion, Sunil started getting a lot of phone calls and letters. The interest is there, and it's very high interest. What we're hoping and expecting is that that high level of interest translates into appropriate levels of offers for the things that we might consider selling."", ""It all comes down to valuation, and that's going to make the difference for us because we do have options. As you know, lots of acreage. We're going to make the best value decision that we can, but we don't see that there would be any impediments, barring something that we haven't foreseen that would cause us to have issues with our divestitures."", 'Neil Mehta -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', 'Thanks, Vicki. The follow-up is just your perspective. Oh, sorry. Please, Sunil.', 'Vicki Hollub -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. What we were going to do is just, for those that haven't heard, Sunil is going to go through what we think about with respect to divestitures, just to give those who might be listening an idea of what we're looking at."", 'Sunil Mathew -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Hi, Neil. As we have said previously, we are evaluating our portfolio, the high-graded portfolio, and identifying what are the assets that does not fit in our development plan, near-term development plan, but that could be attractive to other companies. What is the strategic fit of that asset in this high-graded portfolio? Like Vicki mentioned, what is the value that we can get? Can we potentially accelerate the value by monetizing this asset? Like Vicki said, we're getting a lot of inbounds, even before the announcement and a lot more after the announcement, but this is a criteria that we're using to evaluate, is this an asset that we want to potentially monetize? Going back to your question about $4.5 billion to $6 billion, yes, we are fully committed to achieving the target within 18 months of closing. Between the proceeds from asset sales and organic cash flow, we want to get to the $15 billion of principal debt that we have outlined."", 'Neil Mehta -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', ""That's great perspective. Thank you, Sunil. The follow-up is just on Battleground. I just love your perspective on both the chlorine and caustic soda markets, and how do you think about the outlook there? Once the expansion comes online, do you think that changes the supply demand dynamics for any of these products?"", 'Vicki Hollub -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Just to go back and look at what OxyChem has been able to do the last few years, when we think about pricing of PVC and caustic soda, we've just come out of an incredible super cycle where in 2022 we achieved our highest annual earnings ever, our second-best earnings in 2021, and our third-best in 2023. Now that we're into 2024, prices don't seem to be quite at the bottom. As we were going through the first quarter, we started to see some strengthening in both caustic soda and PVC a little bit. But the reality is that inflation in the United States, along with very weak demand out of China, because they're basically overbuilt right now in both commercial and residential housing and buildings, we don't see China demand getting better anytime soon."", ""But we do believe that beyond this year, getting past our inflationary environment, that once there's some certainty around some reduction in inflation, we think the housing market is already primed for growth again. And so if we can get to an inflation level that is conducive for that, we'll certainly start seeing recovery in prices here in the United States. The international market, and we do export, so the international market impacts us, and so we'll continue to see some pricing challenges in that market. But ultimately, getting beyond this year and the next 18 months, I do believe that, driven by India and other places, that we'll see growth in demand again, and that we'll start seeing prices going back up."", ""So we're feeling like we're probably at a bottom right now."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from John Royall with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.', 'John Royall -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', ""Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So just thinking about the $400 million from midstream contract roll offs, how much of the better terms baked into those numbers are you modeling that's locked in today versus what you're just kind of expecting? And to the extent it isn't locked in, what's your level of confidence that the terms will move the other way as we get closer to the roll offs?"", 'Vicki Hollub -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""I'm sorry, could you repeat that question a little bit? We had some disturbance."", 'Operator', ""Mr. Royall, could you pick up, if you're on a speakerphone, pick up a handset by any chance?"", 'John Royall -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', 'Is this better? Can you hear me now?', 'Operator', 'I think that is better. Go ahead, sir. Please repeat your question.', 'John Royall -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', ""OK. Apologies for that, Vicki. So just thinking about the $400 million from midstream contract roll offs, how much of the better terms baked into those numbers is locked in today versus kind of what you're expecting? And what's your level of confidence that to the extent it's not locked in, that it might not go the other way before you have to renegotiate?"", 'Vicki Hollub -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""I have high confidence that we'll achieve the $400 million. And some of that we're already seeing today. And I do believe that we wouldn't, trust me, we wouldn't say it if we weren't pretty confident that we'll get it."", 'Sunil Mathew -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""And John, it's this confidence that actually helped us increase our cash flow, incremental cash flow from $350 million to $400 million."", 'John Royall -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', 'Fair enough. And then apologies if I miss anything on this, but I was hoping you could get into the 2Q opex guide a little bit, which is somewhat flattish with 1Q despite higher production with the GoM back up. So it looks like a numerator issue and not a denominator issue. Just maybe any color there on the opex guide.', 'Vicki Hollub -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""I think the opex guide was driven mostly by the impact of the Gulf of Mexico production and the production coming back on. Yet, I don't see any differential there."", 'Sunil Mathew -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""No. I think that's right. We're seeing improvement with Gulf of Mexico production coming back. But again, like I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the second quarter does include some impact from the pipeline outage."", 'And we also have a planned shutdown in Central Gulf of Mexico. So by the time you get to the third and fourth quarter, you should see an improvement in the operating cost.', 'Richard Jackson -- President, Operations, U.S. Onshore Resources and Carbon Management', ""Yeah, John. Just to add to that trajectory, Q1 actuals were at $10.31 for U.S. LOE, and we're out looking $10.10 in the second quarter."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Neal Dingmann with Truist. Please go ahead.', 'Neal Dingmann -- Truist Securities -- Analyst', ""Good afternoon. Thanks for the time. Vicki, my question is on your Permian D&C plans, particularly around slide 24. I like what you're showing there."", ""You all suggest, I guess, running about 21 rigs this year on average. This is kind of something you talked about after running, I think it shows, was it 24 in the first quarter? And I'm just wondering, trying to get a sense of the cadence, would it just be a sort of typical ramp down? And I'm also wondering if your operational efficiencies continue to be as good as they've been, would you let some rigs go and continue kind of with that production plan, or would you maybe just ultimately end up producing more?"", 'Richard Jackson -- President, Operations, U.S. Onshore Resources and Carbon Management', ""Yeah, perfect. Yeah, I appreciate the question. Like I mentioned earlier, the plan is to ramp down just sequentially kind of as we go into the second half of the year. And really that's been the plan since we poured it and came out."", ""So we are seeing good operational efficiencies. I'd say time to market really in every area is slightly improved. So we'll consider that as we go into the year to just kind of understand how that may accelerate any capital and how we want to respond to that. I would say one thing that has played out well, we noted these cost improvements."", ""And a couple of things to note, beyond just operational efficiencies, we are seeing some good outcomes as we work with our service providers like frac. And so we've been able to kind of as we relook and hit that more levelized, I'd say, balance and activity in the second half of the year, our utilization is going up about 10% on our frac core. So that's more pumping hours per year. And that's both good for us, but also good for our frac providers in terms of how they manage their business."", ""And so those type of things are delivering the savings, which we think will pace well, even with some acceleration in our operational efficiencies. So as the cadence goes this year, we're heavy on DNC to start the year and facilities as well. Like I mentioned, and really in that back half of the year, you'll see that capital drop and you'll see the production increase. And so looking forward to that."", ""And then that should set us up at a much more level loaded and optimized pace going into 2025. And so obviously we'll have options, depending on where Vicki wants to take us with our capital program. But that's sort of the thinking going into this year and into next."", 'Neal Dingmann -- Truist Securities -- Analyst', ""That's what I was looking for, Richard. And then, Richard, a quick follow-up on the Permian for my second. How do you view the typical, these days you're doing great on both, but your typical Delaware versus Midland well economics? Why I ask is just looking at the curves you all show on slide 25 and 29, which is, again, I think you're toward the top. I think you're showing around 450,000 BOE in the Dale after a year versus around 250,000 in Midland, which again, knowing that they're cheaper wells, just want to maybe in broad strokes, how you think about the difference in the economics?"", 'Richard Jackson -- President, Operations, U.S. Onshore Resources and Carbon Management', ""Yes, I mean, you're saying it right. I mean, I think, and it's the same way we think about these primary and secondary benches, even in the Delaware. The cost matters. And it's not only the drilling and completion costs."", ""You can look at a little bit shallower, a little bit, different drilling in the Midland Basin leading to lower drilling and completion costs. Same for the secondary benches in the Delaware. You get a little shallower into the Bone Springs, they're cheaper. And so certainly you see it play through on the D&C."", 'But the way the teams put together their development areas, they think about the impacts on facility costs. So one of the examples, I know we had reviewed here recently, we had some shallower Bone Spring wells that came on, I think, about three years after we drilled the Wolf Camp wells. And the returns for those secondary wells, even with lower production, was about double the primary. And that was because we were able to reutilize these production facilities.', ""And so that timing of how you put that production together can make a tremendous impact on the improvement of the economics. And so as you think about it in basins, we do the same thing. The advantages of being more balanced in the Midland Basin allows us to optimize all these facility costs, maintenance costs, all these things to make sure we're getting the most production per dollar spent, not just capital, but even opex. So appreciate the question."", ""And that's absolutely how we look at balancing the capital, looking for that full cycle return forward."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead.', 'Scott Gruber -- Citi -- Analyst', ""Yes. Good afternoon. Staying on the topic of the Permian, can you provide some color on what's included in the Permian unconventional inventory count when it comes to the secondary benches in the Bone Springs? And how does their success potentially push the inventory count higher?"", 'Richard Jackson -- President, Operations, U.S. Onshore Resources and Carbon Management', ""Yes, I'll just maybe give you some perspective on how we're thinking about our inventory in general in terms of how that's going, and I can address some of the Bone Springs. So the last couple of years, we've been able to more than replace the wells drilled with improvements in inventory, which come in two buckets. One is appraisal activity, which I'll give you a little color on in terms of Bone Spring to your question, but also production improvement and cost reduction. So both of those things not only add inventory, but they move it, we call it to the left, but gets us to less than 60, less than 50, and then ultimately what we're going for, less than $40 break-even inventory."", ""And so as we think about this year in the unconventional, we had a target of around adding 450 wells in the unconventional less than $50 break-even. A bulk of that will come from, we highlighted one of the highlights we had was this third Bone Spring target that we had on the slide highlighting the four wells with the greater than 780 MBOE or MBO. Those will add a bulk of our improvement this year in terms of that promotion of inventory. And so when I look at even the first quarter, just to give you some color, so we're aiming for this $450 million in the first quarter."", ""We had 90 adds less than $50 breakeven. That came, about half of that, from the Bone Spring wells that I mentioned but we're also getting things out of New Mexico and some of the shallower Bone Spring there. And so it's not only what we're drilling today, which is going up in terms of secondary benches as a percentage of our total drilled wells in the year, but it's really adding that low-cost inventory in the future. And so a lot of times, we'll get the so what of this inventory, and that's really it."", ""It's being able to extend this low-cost capital intensity as we prosecute our plan over the next few years."", 'Scott Gruber -- Citi -- Analyst', ""Got it. And then how do you think about potentially co-developing some of the Bone Springs, along with the core Wolfcamp? Or you're mainly looking at coming back and hitting those zones, leveraging the installed infrastructure as you mentioned?"", 'Richard Jackson -- President, Operations, U.S. Onshore Resources and Carbon Management', ""Yes. I think -- I mean that's a big part of, I'd say, the next few years is really optimizing how we put that together. Obviously, in the Midland, we do a lot more what we call co-development where you're doing these zones at the same time. One of the benefits in the Delaware is being able to sequence them, have a little bit more precision because of the frac barriers."", ""So we don't have to think about more of the cube or co-development opportunities, which gives us a great opportunity to really maximize the savings we get from reusing these facilities, like I described. So last year, I think we were around 20% secondary benches in the Delaware. This year, we're north of 30%. So you can see that sort of opportunity becoming more prominent in terms of our development plans."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Nitin Kumar with Mizuho. Please go ahead.', 'Nitin Kumar -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst', 'Hi. Good afternoon. And thanks for taking my question. I just want to start on CrownRock quickly.', ""You mentioned that you're still on track to close the deal in the third quarter. When we announced the deal, you had talked about 170,000 BOE per day of production from CrownRock. Just wanted to see if you could revisit that and see how things are trending there as you are getting closer to the close?"", 'Vicki Hollub -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""We don't really have any update on the -- either the production or any of the other metrics from CrownRock just what we've provided previously. We'll probably provide, we'll definitely provide an update when we have our next quarterly meeting. Because by that time, I believe, we will have closed, maybe not, but it's going to be certainly sometime in the third quarter."", 'Nitin Kumar -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst', ""Great. And just -- there's been some movement in Colorado around SB24, which requires a production fee on producers. Want to see what that would look like for Oxy? You're a big producer in the state, and sort of what your thoughts are around that initiative?"", 'Vicki Hollub -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Yeah. I think that the agreement that was reached in Colorado was a win-win for both the people of Colorado and the investments, the investors in Colorado. So we feel that paying the fee and along with paying the fee to have taken away some bills and some potential ballot measures that would have severely restricted what the oil and gas industry could do that when you take that together, all together, it provides a scenario for the governor and the government of Colorado to do something positive with the fees that will be collected. So we view this to be not overly burdensome for our operations.', ""We think it's actually going to be a doable scenario for us as we work toward doing some of the other things that will come along with this, which is working more on doing things that impact and help to reduce the impact on the ozone layer as well as doing some things that will help from an environmental justice standpoint. So it's a full package deal. It's not just a fee. And putting all that together, it's a good deal."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from David Deckelbaum with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.', 'David Deckelbaum -- TD Cowen -- Analyst', ""Good afternoon, Vicki and team. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask for a little bit more color just on the guide just so I'm clear on how numbers are progressing this year. The impact from the Gulf of Mexico, is that exclusively what's contributing to the 100-basis-point reduction in oil cut this year? Are you seeing some contribution from some gassier zones and some other of your core assets or perhaps the impact of the PSE in areas like Algeria?"", 'Vicki Hollub -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""No. It was almost entirely due to the Gulf of Mexico shutdown. There's really nothing else trending differently that we have in our portfolio."", 'David Deckelbaum -- TD Cowen -- Analyst', 'Appreciate that. And then maybe just a follow-up on the discussion around deleveraging and noncore asset sales. It sounds like on this call, you might be emphasizing more the cash flow returns that you would be otherwise receiving from some of these assets that maybe the market has flagged as the divestiture candidates. Is that the intention here in signaling that you intend to delever more organically in that noncore asset sales either theoretically would be higher in dollar value to reflect that cash flow contribution or might take longer to materialize?', 'Vicki Hollub -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""I don't think that's what we intended to say. That was not the message we intended to give. When we talk about the fact that we will evaluate everything from a value perspective. What we want to do is just ensure that we're making the right decisions and divestitures of noncore areas is something that we want to do."", ""And we believe that based on the interest that we're seeing that we should be able to achieve."", 'Operator', 'In the interest of time, this concludes our question-and-answer session.

GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with VRTX.', ""Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:VRTX), a leading global biotechnology firm, recently released its 10-Q filing on May 7, 2024, offering a detailed glimpse into its financial and operational performance. The company, renowned for its small-molecule drugs treating serious diseases, reported a significant increase in net income from $699.8 million in Q1 2023 to $1,099.6 million in Q1 2024. This impressive growth is reflected in the basic and diluted net income per share, which rose from $2.72 and $2.69 to $4.26 and $4.21, respectively. Product revenues also saw a healthy uptick, climbing from $2,374.8 million to $2,690.6 million. These financial metrics not only demonstrate Vertex's strong market position but also its ability to generate shareholder value amidst a dynamic healthcare landscape."", ""Market Leadership in Cystic Fibrosis Treatments: Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:VRTX) has established itself as the standard of care in cystic fibrosis (CF) treatments globally. The company's flagship drugs, including Kalydeco, Orkambi, Symdeko, and Trikafta/Kaftrio, have contributed to a robust product revenue growth of 13% year-over-year, as reported in the recent 10-Q filing. This growth is a testament to the company's ability to innovate and maintain a dominant market position. Vertex's commitment to addressing unmet medical needs in CF has not only enhanced its brand reputation but also solidified its competitive advantage."", ""Financial Resilience and R&D Investment: Vertex's financial statements reflect a strong balance sheet, with a substantial increase in net income and comprehensive income. The company's strategic investments in research and development (R&D) are evident in its expenses, which, while substantial, are indicative of a forward-looking approach to pipeline diversification and future growth. Vertex's financial prudence and commitment to R&D underscore its potential for sustained long-term growth and its ability to weather market volatility."", ""Dependence on Core CF Franchise: Despite Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:VRTX)'s success in the CF market, its heavy reliance on this core franchise could pose risks. The 10-Q filing reveals that a significant portion of the company's revenue is generated from its CF treatments. While this specialization has allowed Vertex to excel, it also exposes the company to potential vulnerabilities should new competitors or therapies emerge. Diversifying its portfolio beyond CF is crucial to mitigate this concentration risk and ensure long-term stability."", 'Cost of Sales and Operational Expenses: The recent 10-Q filing indicates an increase in the cost of sales as a percentage of net product revenues, from 11% to 13%. This rise, primarily due to costs associated with CASGEVY following its regulatory approval, highlights the challenges Vertex faces in managing production and operational expenses. While these costs are necessary for growth, optimizing them is essential to improve profit margins and maintain financial health.', ""Expansion into New Therapeutic Areas: Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:VRTX) is strategically positioned to expand its portfolio into new therapeutic areas. The acquisition of Alpine Immune Sciences, Inc. and the development of povetacicept for IgA nephropathy (IgAN) signal Vertex's intent to diversify beyond CF. The potential entry into Phase 3 clinical development for IgAN in the second half of 2024 presents an opportunity for Vertex to tap into a market with no approved therapies targeting the underlying cause of the disease, potentially leading to a new revenue stream."", ""Global Market Penetration: Vertex's 10-Q filing highlights the strong uptake of TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO in ex-U.S. markets, demonstrating the company's potential for further global expansion. By leveraging its existing CF treatments and pursuing label expansions, Vertex can increase its international footprint, catering to a larger patient population and driving revenue growth in untapped markets."", ""Competitive Pressure and Market Dynamics: The biotechnology sector is characterized by rapid innovation and intense competition. Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:VRTX) faces the constant threat of emerging competitors and novel therapies that could disrupt its market share. The company's focus on CF treatments, while a strength, also makes it susceptible to shifts in market dynamics and patient preferences. Staying ahead of the curve through continuous innovation and strategic partnerships is vital to mitigate these competitive threats."", ""Regulatory and Pricing Challenges: Vertex operates in a highly regulated industry where drug approvals and pricing are subject to stringent scrutiny. The company's ability to maintain and obtain adequate reimbursement for its products is crucial for its financial success. Changes in healthcare policies or adverse regulatory actions could impact Vertex's market access and profitability, as indicated in the 10-Q filing's discussion on commitments and contingencies."", ""In conclusion, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:VRTX) presents a compelling SWOT profile, with its strong market position in CF treatments, financial resilience, and strategic R&D investments serving as key strengths. However, the company must address its reliance on the CF franchise and manage operational expenses to maintain its competitive edge.

The index stayed below the 5,200 level it had briefly reached earlier in the week, reflecting a loss of momentum in the stock market. The day's trading was characterized by fluctuations, with notable declines in major technology companies such as Nvidia and Tesla. These losses played a role in tempering Wall Street's enthusiasm for stocks. Uber Technologies also suffered a sharp drop after reporting disappointing first-quarter bookings, while Intel saw a decline due to a downgraded revenue outlook in light of a U.S. ban on chip exports to Huawei Technologies. At the same time, oil prices reversed earlier losses after a decline in U.S. stockpiles suggested a tightening market. West Texas Intermediate crude traded above $78 a barrel as the Energy Information Administration reported a reduction of 1.36 million barrels in inventories. This shift in the oil market is seen as a bullish indicator amid generally bearish technical trends. These factors reflect an inflection point in the market, as investors reassess their positions amid evolving economic conditions, corporate performance concerns, and changes in the oil market. Futures positioning has raised doubts about the strength of the S&P 500's recent gains, suggesting that some investors are more cautious about the sustainability of the rally."", ""On May 8, an official from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expressed concern over the growing divisions between the United States and China, warning that their trade tensions could hinder global economic growth. The U.S. has heightened trade restrictions and sanctions on China, citing national security concerns and ongoing disputes in the South China Sea and around Taiwan, reported CNBC. IMF Deputy Managing Director Gita Gopinath noted that trade relations between the U.S.-led Western bloc and the China-aligned bloc have weakened since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Trade between these blocs has decreased by roughly 12%, and foreign direct investment has fallen by 20% compared to levels within these groups. The IMF estimates that, in the most extreme scenario, these divisions could cost the world up to 7% of its GDP. The pandemic and geopolitical strife have disrupted international trade patterns not seen since the Cold War, according to Gopinath. Increasingly, countries are focusing on economic and national security when making trade and investment decisions. This trend threatens to undermine a rules-based global trading system and the benefits of economic integration. However, while the global economy faces significant challenges due to fragmentation, the overall trade-to-GDP ratio has been relatively stable over the past two decades. This stability is partly due to the role of neutral countries like Mexico and Vietnam, which act as connectors for rerouting trade and investment between the U.S. and China. These non-aligned nations leverage their economic and diplomatic influence to help keep the world economy integrated. The presence of these neutral mediators may serve as a buffer against the full impact of the ongoing U.S.-China tensions, providing a pathway for continued international cooperation and trade."", 'On the stock market front, analysts are bullish on stocks such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), ServiceNow, Inc.

The firm maintained its Overweight rating on the shares due to a significant financial outperformance in the first quarter. The company exhibited strong results in both its top-line and bottom-line performance. Piper Sandler highlighted that despite a mention of some inventory benefits from international channels, the key focus of the story is on the company's advances in its late-stage pipeline. Specifically, Piper Sandler is optimistic about the submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) for vanza, with the potential for approval in January 2025. Additionally, progress on the rolling NDA for suzetrigine, targeting acute pain, is underway and is expected to be completed this quarter. The current market price for Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) stands at $422.52, and the new price target suggests an upside potential of approximately 11%.

HSBC's decision to increase the price target reflects its preference for Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) within the U.S. online travel market. The firm's analyst noted Booking's advantage in terms of scale and consistent execution, which distinguishes it from competitors in the space. The performance gap between Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) and its peers has become more pronounced, particularly in the first quarter, across various metrics. The recommendation suggests that Booking Holdings Inc.

The Company grew bookings on their platforms +16% and reported +22% growth in adjusted operating income during their fourth quarter of 2023. We think the market is cautious about the Company’s results for 2024 because they will be lapping very high levels of growth compared to those in 2023 (full year 2023 bookings growth +24%). However, Booking’s end markets continue to be quite healthy, outside of geographies affected by war because consumers still have plenty of wallet share to re-dedicate to travel compared to pre-COVID-19 numbers. We applaud the Company as they aggressively repurchase shares at valuation levels well below the market and peers.

The firm believes that D.R. Horton, Inc.

Horton, Inc.\xa0(NYSE:DHI), Inc., and Lennar Corporation – gained 39.4%, 41.8%, and 33.2%, respectively, in the most recent quarter, in part due to the continuation of strong quarterly business results, management optimism about 2024 prospects, and a more than 100 basis point decline in 30-year mortgage rates during the quarter.', '2023 was an excellent year for the public homebuilders. Housing fundamentals were resilient despite the affordability challenges of elevated mortgage rates and home prices. Several years of pent-up demand, fears that mortgage rates could move higher, a dearth of inventory in the existing home market, and an overall housing supply shortage drove home buyers off the sidelines to “stretch their wallet,” in part due to fears that they could miss out on the opportunity to buy a home.

In the past few years, there has been a significant rise in demand for telemedicine-focused online medical and artificial intelligence (AI)-powered technology services. Post-pandemic, many healthcare companies that were traditionally not technology-based transformed to survive in the market. Per a report by Precedence Research, the global home healthcare market was valued at $373.56 billion in 2023 and is anticipated to reach $1,469.92 billion by 2033 at a CAGR of approximately 14.8%. Another factor prompting these MedTech players to embrace digital healthcare is the skyrocketing healthcare costs.', 'On a positive note, rising dependence on telehealth and AI is likely to help the industry thrive in the near term. DaVita Inc. DVA, Encompass Health Corporation EHC, Option Care Health, Inc. OPCH and The Pennant Group, Inc. PNTG are likely to gain from the prospects.', 'Industry Description', 'The industry comprises companies that offer ambulatory care in an outpatient setting or at home. They use advanced medical technologies for diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation services. The players include operators of HMO medical centers, kidney dialysis centers and other outpatient care centers. After navigating a tough pandemic era, the payers and providers have been seeing steady growth on the back of innovation in services. This buoys optimism about prospects over the next few years, although persistent inflation in consumer prices could dent the outlook. The potential for scaling up innovation, prompted by the pandemic’s pressure on the healthcare system, is an added plus. Also, the acceleration of value-based care models and the increasing application of technology across the healthcare industry are likely to continue in the long run.', 'Major Trends Shaping the Future of the Outpatient and Home Healthcare Industry', 'Cost Effectiveness: The primary advantage of outpatient clinics is cost-effectiveness. Outpatient medical care clinics do not retain patients for long hours (overnight) or charge exorbitantly. Modern-day outpatient clinics offer a broad spectrum of treatment and diagnostic options and even minor surgical procedures. Financial incentives like health plans and government program payment policies supporting services in lower-cost care settings have also been driving outpatient care.Additionally, with value-based models of care steadily emerging as the future of healthcare, the shift from fee-for-service (FFS) to alternative payment models (APM) is an ongoing parallel trend. FFS will be crucial to care organizations as a benchmark through which providers can assess APM.', 'AI’s Dominant Role: AI has been a roaring success in healthcare. Outpatient companies prefer bots and automated techniques for managing health information. With the help of AI, hospitals have been achieving better outcomes, with patients receiving more efficient and personalized care. The outpatient industry has been generating huge profits from electronic health records (EHRs) and ePrescriptions.', 'Virtual Healthcare Assistants: Virtual assistants and chatbots can help patients by answering questions about their care and connecting them with the information they need to make more informed decisions about their care. Increasingly, they will interface with EHR systems and be used to book and schedule appointments. They can also help patients stay compliant by reminding them to take medications or exercise.', 'Dependence on Telehealth: The pandemic has accelerated healthcare innovation. Home healthcare can gain from the benefits provided by Medicare (and several other payers) that comprise a broad range of services that can be delivered in a patient’s home, including post-operative and chronic wound care. Home healthcare has seen a surge in the utilization of the telehealth platform in response to the pandemic. With a rise in the elderly population and the increasing costs of in-person health care, the demand for home-based health care is on the rise. People with chronic illnesses and disabilities also require home-based care.Currently, Internet of Things (IoT)-powered virtual hospitals and telemedicine are quite popular. This trend includes both telemedicine and wearable devices connected to the global network, known as the IoT. By using connected devices to remotely monitor patients and provide communication channels for healthcare professionals, more elements of care can be delivered remotely.', 'Staffing Shortages: The U.S. healthcare industry has been experiencing a severe shortage of workers at every level. Among support personnel, there is a laxity of home health aides. The increasing international migration of health workers may aggravate health workforce shortfalls, especially in low-income and lower-middle-income countries. Another reason for the acute staffing shortage is high burnout due to physical, emotional and mental exhaustion. Thus, these overworked employees are leaving the profession at an accelerating rate.Healthcare staffing shortages lead to poor patient outcomes that can include hospital-acquired infections, patient falls and increased probabilities of death. With a lesser number of staff available in hospital settings for patient care, there has been a gradual shift toward home healthcare for non-critical patients who can be monitored remotely.', 'Zacks Industry Rank', 'The Zacks Medical - Outpatient and Home Healthcare industry falls within the broader Zacks Medical sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #81, which places it in the top 32% of nearly 250 Zacks industries.', 'The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects.

Reported EPS is $1.34, expectations were $1.33. Sempra isn’t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).', ""Operator: Good day, and welcome to Sempra's First Quarter Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn it over to Glen Donovan. Please go ahead."", ""Glen Donovan: Good morning and welcome to Sempra's first quarter 2024 earnings call. The live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation are available on our website under our Events and Presentations section. We have several members of our management team with us today, including Jeff Martin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Karen Sedgwick, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Trevor Mihalik, Executive Vice President and Group President, Sempra California; Justin Bird, Executive Vice President and Chief Executive Officer of Sempra Infrastructure; Allen Nye, Chief Executive Officer of Oncor; Peter Wall, Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer and other members of our senior management team."", ""Before starting, I'd like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement we make today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K filed and 10-Q filled with the SEC. Earnings per common share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call for reconciliation to GAAP measures. We also encourage you to review our 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024."", ""I'd also like to mention that forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only of today May 7, 2024 and it's important to note that the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. With that, please turn to slide 4 and let me hand the call over to Jeff."", ""Jeff Martin: Thank you, Gle,n and thank you all for joining us today. We're pleased to report our first quarter financial results. It's a great start to the year and sets us up well to provide strong financial performance for 2024. In addition to the strength of our financial performance, the market backdrop for energy infrastructure continues to be very constructive. We're seeing strong macroeconomic fundamentals supporting US energy demand with the economy continuing to grow at a steady pace with manufacturing production gains, easing of supply chain constraints and continued job creation. We previously discussed the view that our industry is experiencing a super cycle of growth and believe Sempra's strategy and portfolio are well-positioned to benefit from current trends."", ""In addition to the long-term demand from reshoring and electrification of transportation, artificial intelligence and data centers are driving new growth in digital infrastructure with demand estimates tripling from 2.5% of total US electric consumption to 7.5% by 2030. Growth in Texas is also particularly remarkable with ERCOT recently raising its forecasted peak demand by the end of the decade to over 150 gigawatts. Of note, that's 65 gigawatts higher than the all-time record in the state. Against the backdrop of strong industry fundamentals, Sempra offers several competitive advantages. First in California we're at the forefront of the energy transition, serving 25 million consumers in the country's largest economy and one of the largest manufacturing bases in the US."", ""And through our general rate cases, we're expecting to make new investments that support electrification and decarbonization while also improving affordability, safety and reliability. Turning to Texas, we're seeing diverse industrial, C&I and residential growth, which is creating jobs, increasing electricity demand and requiring significant investments to modernize and expand the electricity grid. With economic expansion, the safety and resilience of the grid becomes even more critical, and in part, that's why Oncor's recently filed system resiliency plan is both timely and important. Al will speak to this in greater detail later in today's presentation. And finally, at Sempra Infrastructure, we're supporting global demand for energy security are in the midst of a second wave of LNG developments expected to support over 700 million tonnes per annum of demand by 2050."", ""Our dual coast LNG strategy is contributing to this push with approximately 16 million tons per annum of new export capacity currently under construction, which would more than double our existing LNG operating footprint. The key takeaway is we're excited about the opportunities ahead and Sempra Infrastructure looks to provide cleaner and more reliable sources of energy to its customers while charting a course for attractive built-in growth through the end of the decade. It's also important to note that Sempra Infrastructure's growth forecasts are based solely on projects that have reached FID and are under construction and doesn't yet include expected upside from a series of other projects still in development. Turning now to our financial results."", ""We reported first quarter 2024 adjusted EPS of $1.34. In addition, we're pleased to also affirm our full year 2024 adjusted EPS guidance range of $4.60 to $4.90 and 2025 EPS guidance of $4.90 to $5.25. As a reminder, when you look at our adjusted EPS guidance range from 2023 to 2025, it reflects approximately 7% annual growth, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth expectations of 6% to 8%. Please turn to the next slide where I'll turn the call over to Karen to provide several business updates."", ""Karen Sedgwick: Thank you, Jeff. We've previously said that 2024 will be an important year of execution at each of our growth platforms, and I'm excited to provide an update on our progress. At Sempra, California, we continue to see constructive regulatory outcomes. In March, the CPUC issued a proposed decision supporting the updated return on equity that was implemented this year as part of the CCM trigger. The commission agreed that current cost of capital mechanism operated as designed, and the recently established returns on equity at SDG&E of 10.65% and at SoCalGas of 10.5% should remain in place through 2025 unless market conditions result in a trigger. Importantly, this improves regulatory certainty by affirming the protection that the CCM provides to customers and shareholders."", ""And the key takeaway is that this is another constructive data point for California's regulatory framework. Another example of this is rate reform. Improving affordability for all of our utility customers is a top priority and I'm pleased to share that a proposed decision was issued at the CPUC in March to implement a fixed charge for residential electric customers. As currently proposed, this will reduce volumetric rates, support a more fair rate structure, and help California meet its clean energy goals. A final decision is expected in the second quarter of 2024, and the fixed charge would then be expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2025. During the quarter, we also made a joint filing with the other California utilities to develop projects that successfully demonstrate blending hydrogen into the natural gas system."", 'These projects will begin blending at up to 5% on isolated sections of the natural gas system and incrementally increase the hydrogen concentration based on safety and technical feasibility. Hydrogen blending has been demonstrated safely and reliably around the world for decades. And we look forward to working with our partners to support new and improved ways to expand decarbonization efforts here in the state. Turning to the GRC, we expect a proposed decision in the second quarter and a final decision this year. Once the final decision is obtained it will be retroactive to the beginning of the year. As a reminder, after we receive a final decision, we will have a clear regulatory pathway for execution on our utility-focused capital plan through 2027.', ""Lastly, Cal ISO updated SDG&E that it was not selected to move forward on the Imperial Valley transmission line and substation. It's important to note that we were financially disciplined in how we developed our bid and we look forward to supporting the project's successful development as well as building the other transmission projects that were directly awarded to SDG&E by Cal ISO. Turning to Texas, we continue to see significant growth across Oncor's service territory. Just last month, ERCOT issued an updated transmission planning report, forecasting approximately 40% higher load in 2030 than in last year's report. And yesterday, Oncor made its inaugural SRP filing, which includes approximately $3 billion of capital investments. In addition to SRP, the 2023 legislative session was particularly constructive for the state's utilities."", ""We're already seeing the positive impacts at Oncor in terms of the planning and execution that support the state's priorities and improve the timing of the company's returns on capital. Moving to Sempra Infrastructure. We're very excited about the opportunity to help deliver cleaner energy to our customers and partners. Recently, we declared a positive FID at our Cimarron Wind Expansion project. This project demonstrates our ability to generate attractive returns while utilizing existing company-owned transmission capacity to serve the California market and targeting O&M efficiencies based on locational advantages. Additionally, we're making great progress at ECA LNG Phase 1 and Port Arthur LNG Phase 1. ECA is roughly 80% complete and remains on target to start commercial operations in the summer of 2025."", ""Port Arthur also remains on schedule with significant ongoing construction activity including excellent progress around soil stabilization, new foundations, and the commencement of concrete pouring and structural steel work. Turning to our marketing efforts. The LNG market is long-term by nature and while the DOE pause has received a lot of press, we remain confident in our ability to deliver projects that offer long-term, secure, and cleaner energy to customers. Sempra Infrastructure benefits from experienced project development teams that continue to make progress on critical work streams including permitting, engineering, and commercial negotiations. Moreover, the referenced pause does not impact our confidence in the overall competitive positioning of our development projects and we're strategically utilizing this time to steadily advance our opportunities."", ""Also of note, even if you only take into consideration projects that have reached FID, Sempra Infrastructure has incredible built-in growth. With 16 million tonnes per annum of LNG export facilities, associated infrastructure, and a new wind project under construction, we're improving visibility to attractive earnings growth through the end of our planning period in 2028. And that's all, before taking into account our development project pipeline, which Jeff referenced earlier and offers notable upside. We can now turn to the next slide, where Allen will discuss ERCOT's new planning processes."", 'Allen Nye: Thank you, Karen. As we have been discussing for several quarters now, Texas continues to experience strong demand growth. Oncor now serves close to 13 million customers and has now surpassed over four million meters. ERCOT is adapting to this growth, with a recently announced new planning process, to account for higher expected electricity needs in the future. In April, ERCOT announced that peak load is expected to reach 152 gigawatts in 2030, nearly double the record set last year of 85 gigawatts. This load growth is coming from a wide range of industries across the state, including new and expanded C&I, electrification of oil and gas operations, data centers, manufacturing and residential. To put this growth in context, the change from 2023 to 2030 would be like adding load greater than the size of the entire California power market.', 'Currently, we anticipate that approximately 40% of the new load, will come from Oncor service territory. So from our perspective, as one of the premier builders of T&D infrastructure in America, we are excited about the opportunity to continue to scale our investments in electric infrastructure. Since 2018, Oncor has constructed approximately 13,000 miles of transmission and distribution lines, approximately six miles per day. We have an active planning process underway and are confident in our ability to secure the materials and labor, necessary to serve our customers in the ERCOT market. Please turn to the next slide. Given the growth in the state, resiliency is more critical than ever. In 2023, the Texas legislature passed House Bill 2555, which allows electric utilities to file system resiliency plans, proposing capital and operational expenditures to improve overall grid resiliency.', 'We made our first filing yesterday, for approximately $3 billion of new capital expenditures and just over $500 million of operating expenditures, to be made over a period of three years. This investment would address overhead and underground system resiliency and modernization, flexible and self-healing distribution system, vegetation management, wildfire mitigation and cyber and physical security. To provide some additional color, the majority of our proposed spend is in the modernization and hardening of the older parts of our distribution system, by adding lightning protection, stronger class poles and cross arms and addressing capacity constrained parts of the grid, during extreme temperatures. Furthermore, we are proposing significant technology and infrastructure investments that will help enable, the automated reconfiguration of our system when extreme storms hit, quickly restoring service to customers on undamaged segments by intelligently rerouting power.', ""I would also like to highlight, that we have invested in wildfire mitigation for many years including, effectively partnering with industry leaders like SDG&E and the Texas A&M Forest Service. Now, thanks to HB 2555, Oncor has an additional opportunity to further accelerate our wildfire mitigation strategies across our service territory. We estimate that approximately $900 million of the total proposed spend including both CapEx and OpEx will focus on expanding our wildfire mitigation tools and implementing our grid modernization and hardening measures in wildfire-prone areas. Procedurally, the SRP statute provides 180 days for the PUCT to review the filing, and we anticipate having a decision by the end of the year. The SRP program with approximately $3 billion of capital expenditures if approved would be incremental to Oncor's $24.2 billion of planned CapEx announced earlier this year for the five year period 2024 to 2028."", ""We believe our proposed SRP creates an opportunity to fundamentally improve customer reliability and overall customer service during and after extreme weather events while also helping to mitigate other risks. I will now turn the call back to Karen to walk through Sempra's financial update."", 'Karen Sedgwick: Thanks, Allen. Earlier today, Sempra reported first quarter 2024 GAAP earnings of $801 million or $1.26 per share. This compares to first quarter 2023 GAAP earnings of $969 million or $1.53 per share. On an adjusted basis, first quarter 2024 earnings were $854 million or $1.34 per share. This compares to our first quarter 2023 earnings of $922 million or $1.46 per share. Please turn to the next slide. Variances in the first quarter 2024 adjusted earnings compared to the same period last year can be summarized as follows at Sempra California, we had $24 million primarily from higher net interest expense and lower income tax benefits and $12 million of lower CPUC base operating margin, net of operating expenses, offset by higher authorized cost of capital.', 'As a reminder, because our GRC is still pending, our CPUC revenues in first quarter 2024 are still based on 2023 authorized levels. This is important because any true-up later this year will be retroactively applied to January 1 when the final decision is approved. Turning to Sempra Texas. We had $56 million of higher equity earnings attributable to rate updates, increased embedded capital, and consumption, partially offset by higher interest and operating expenses. At Sempra Infrastructure, we had $13 million of lower transportation revenues and higher O&M, partially offset by higher power results, and $27 million of lower asset and supply optimization, partially offset by lower net interest expense due to capitalized interest, lower taxes and other.', ""As a note, beginning this year, the waterfall numbers are presented after non-controlling interest to improve comparability. At Sempra Parent, the $48 million quarter-over-quarter change is primarily due to higher taxes from the interim period application of an annual forecasted consolidated effective tax rate, which is expected to turn around over the course of the year. Please turn to next slide. Before we close out our prepared remarks, I want to outline Sempra's value proposition as we execute our corporate strategy. At Sempra, our management team is committed to challenging the status quo in all aspects of our business operations. We offer exposure to growth in some of North America's largest economic markets. Our position as a leader in the infrastructure development in these markets translates into a record $48 billion capital campaign through 2028."", ""In addition, we make energy infrastructure investments that target attractive mid-teens returns on equity and we understand that disciplined capital allocation is central to our success. And we understand the importance of returning capital to our owners and expect to continue growing our dividend. Of note, we've successfully grown our dividend at a rate of roughly 7% annually over the last 10 years. This is particularly noteworthy given the expected strength of our future earnings growth. To conclude, the role of our industry is becoming increasingly important to society and at Sempra we're excited about the prospects ahead of us. Sempra is competitively positioned to capitalize on opportunities and we'll continue to invest in our people, prudently manage risks, efficiently finance our businesses and be good stewards of the capital entrusted to us."", ""We thank you for joining us and I'd now like to open the line for your questions."", 'See also', '12 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy Now According to Wall Street Analysts and', 'Insiders are Buying These 10 Undervalued Bank Stocks.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus."", ""Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases."", 'Cincinnati Financial in Focus', ""Based in Fairfield, Cincinnati Financial (CINF) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of 13.28%.

Focus on becoming a one-stop insurance destination, catering to customers opting for a combination of home and auto insurance, augurs well for the company's growth.

Competitive pricing to retain current customers and address customer needs with new offerings should continue to drive policy life expectancy.

of bare minerals and Laura Mercier.Thanks so much for being here.Thank you for having me.Now You guys are a private company, but we have a number of publicly traded beauty companies, and it's sort of been all over the map in terms of what we've been hearing from them.Ulta, the retailer, kind of came out with a disappointing forecast and really shocked many who were covering the company.But then you've had some of the manufacturers and even a competitor like Sephora that have done OK.So what are you seeing in your business amidst that sort of murky environment?Yes, I mean, we're seeing a very strong Q one in the prestige cosmetic space.That's where we typically play, and particularly in this sort of skin, we're very complexion based.So we saw, you know, comps in Q, one that were double digit, strong, double digit and double the rate of category growth.But if you sort of talk about the broader market, and this is a sort of, you know, the lipstick effect that people often talk about in beauty.We are seeing that prestige is growing at a much faster rate than the mass beauty market, I think in Q one, or it was 9% growth versus 2% for the Mass.So those at the higher price points and more luxury positioning and iconic products such as ourselves continue to do well.And that's really interesting, because we have been hearing not necessarily in beauty but sort of across consumer discretionary that some of the lower income consumers are not.They're not seeing as much demand, but it sounds like it's holding up at the upper end.Is that true across geographies as well?It is for us.But then, of course, beauty is often distorted by these viral moments that one has.So we had one in January of this year with our real flawless foundation, which a lady called glam zilla did a post and we had 50 million, uh, 50 million views, 1.5 million likes, and suddenly it's a sensation.And so this is one thing I really love about beauty.You can go from, like trend overnight to this sort of sensational sales mix.And did you guys have a partnership with glam zilla or was she just kind of, you know, in fact, that product, um, had existed for a year?It's a beautiful product.I highly recommend it, but it really speaks to this idea of sort of skin very breathable.24 hours hydration and, uh, a very kind of rough and ready post from glam Zilla who's amazing kind of kicked off not just in the USA, a viral sensation, but globally.And what do you do when that happened?I mean, did you have enough supply to meet the surge in demand that you saw?We Thankfully, we did have a lot of supply from the launch the previous year.Not as much as we would have liked, obviously, because one can't kind of deal with these 500% up surges, but we're now back in stock and shipping globally.But it just shows how powerful platforms like tiktok have become.Yeah, definitely.And you mentioned sort of channels as well.When you've got to ship that out to people, what are you seeing in terms of that in terms of demand through, say, department stores or Sephora versus the direct consumer channel.I mean, beauty has been incredibly resilient in that we are seeing growth in all channels.ECommerce growth is now sort of 12%.But for example, Amazon has become a force in beauty, and we launched bare minerals there last year and have doubled our sales already this year.But alongside that, the specialist channels like you mentioned Sephora Alta continue to do brilliantly and obviously globally, particularly in Asia.We see department stores with double digit growth.That's interesting as well, because that had been a channel that waning in some in some ways, um, you mentioned the prestige is doing well.I'm curious.If there is any price sensitivity right, have you been able to raise prices?Have you gotten any kind of push back from customers, or is it just sort of They're happy to pay it.I think whenever you have iconic products and we have several that have been around for 30 years, like our original loose foundation or our secret camouflage for Laura Mercier, you have to be careful because customers buy you kind of every couple of months.They love your product, and they are very aware of the pricing.But one thing I would say is when you have these heritage iconic products, people really trust you for quality, particularly Laura Mercier or with bare minerals.We see people who want, like no to or limited ingredients five ingredients in our products.So therefore, it's hard to switch, and so you mustn't kind of abuse the customer's trust around that.But you can pass on some inflation, and we have done, uh, we're always very sensitive to what is reasonable for our customers.Right?Nela, Thanks so much for coming in.Thank you.Appreciate it.""]"

Dividend growth is a powerful indicator of a company’s financial strength and commitment to rewarding shareholders. Businesses that can maintain and grow their dividends over decades demonstrate stability, predictability, and the ability to weather economic challenges. In this article, we’ll introduce three reliable companies with impressive dividend growth streaks spanning more than 50 years.', 'A long track record of increasing dividends is a positive sign for investors for several reasons. First, it reflects the company’s financial stability and predictability. Consistently growing dividends suggest that the business generates steady, reliable cash flows that can support higher payouts over time. Second, a history of dividend growth bodes well for future increases, potentially leading to compounding returns for long-term investors. Finally, rising dividends can serve as a hedge against inflation, as the income stream from these stocks often outpaces rising prices over the years.', 'Current yield: 2.43%', 'Procter & Gamble is a consumer staples giant with a diverse portfolio of well-known brands, including Tide, Pampers, and Gillette. The company boasts an astounding 67 years of consecutive dividend growth, making it a true Dividend King. P&G’s dominance in its core markets and focus on innovation have enabled it to generate consistent profits and reward shareholders with rising dividends for over six decades.', 'Current yield: 3.34%', 'Johnson & Johnson is a healthcare behemoth with a presence in pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and consumer health products. With 62 years of consecutive dividend increases, JNJ is another Dividend King with a proven commitment to shareholder returns. The company’s strong brand recognition, diversified business model, and consistent product pipeline contribute to its reliable cash flow generation, which supports its impressive dividend growth streak.', 'Current yield: 3.1%', 'Coca-Cola is a global beverage icon with a strong presence in markets worldwide. The company has increased its dividend for an impressive 61 consecutive years, earning it a place among the elite Dividend Kings. While KO’s dividend growth has been more modest in recent years compared to the other examples, its strong brand, global reach, and dominant market position still make it a reliable dividend payer for income-seeking investors.', 'Companies with a long history of consistently increasing dividends can be attractive options for income-focused investors. As long as the company continues increasing its payout, the yield on your original investment will keep growing over time. Furthermore, reinvesting your dividends today can result in even greater income down the road.', 'The three Dividend Kings discussed in this article – Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson and Coca-Cola – have demonstrated their ability to reward shareholders with rising payouts for over five decades. However, it’s essential to conduct thorough research and consider your individual investment goals before making any investment decisions. By exploring companies with a proven track record of dividend growth, investors can potentially build a reliable, growing income stream to support their financial objectives.', 'Real estate has historically been one of the most reliable sources of income for investors but is traditionally far from a passive investment when you consider all of the management responsibilities involved. However, a company backed by Amazon.com Inc founder Jeff Bezos has created a real estate investment platform that allows retail investors to buy shares of carefully selected rental properties. The best part is you can invest with as little as $100.', 'Arrived takes on all of the landlord responsibilities while investors simply collect monthly dividends from the rental income while the properties appreciate in value over time.

My name is MJ, and I will be your operator for today's call. This call is being recorded for replay purposes. All lines are in a listen-only mode. Our speakers will address your questions at the end of the presentation during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Steven Borenstein, Executive Vice President and Corporation Counsel. Please go ahead."", ""Steven Borenstein: Welcome to Vornado Realty Trust's first quarter earnings call. Yesterday afternoon, we issued our first quarter earnings release and filed our quarterly report on Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents, as well as our supplemental financial information packages are available on our website, www.vno.com, under the Investor Relations section. In these documents and during today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in our earnings release, Form 10-Q, and financial supplement. Please be aware that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties, and other factors."", ""Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for more information regarding these risks and uncertainties. The call may include time-sensitive information that may be accurate only as of today's date. The company does not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements. On the call today from management for our opening comments are Steven Roth, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Franco, President and Chief Financial Officer. Our senior team is also present and available for questions. I will now turn the call over to Steven Roth."", ""Steven Roth: Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. We've been busy. Let's start with Bloomberg. As a reminder, 731 Lexington Avenue, the mixed-use tower, whose 950,000 square foot office condo is Bloomberg's global headquarters, is owned by Alexander's, a separately traded public REIT. Vornado owns 32.4% of Alexander's. The background facts are Bloomberg lease expires in February 2029, $500 million -- and $500 million of debt on the office condo is due next month, June 2024. Yesterday, we announced that we renewed and extended the Bloomberg lease for an 11-year term to begin in February 2029 and take us through February 2040. So, 16 years of term from now. As you can imagine, every developer in town tried to poach Bloomberg."", ""And of course, they looked at every opportunity, as they must. We are delighted that they chose to stay with 731 Lexington. By the way, the Bloomberg -- the building is as much Mike's creation as mine. He had significant input into the design of the original building. The design of the building and Bloomberg's internal fit-out are on a par with what we would have built today, but of course, now they don't need to. The terms of the lease are spilled out in yesterday's SEC filings. Tenant concessions in the form of TIs and free rent have been established, and the net rent will be the subject of an appraisal in 2029 with the then rent adjusted up or down no more than 10% either way, based on the then market conditions. We're in the process of refinancing this asset, but I must say I am not excited about paying today's market rate of 7% or even 8% for debt with all the trappings of leasing reserves, cash sweeps and such, which are admittedly protective of the lender, but don't do much for our equity value."", ""As we speak, my personal favorite is to pay the debt down and maybe even pay the debt off, we shall see. Now, let's focus on our credit lines. Traditionally, we've had two separate but similar credit lines with staggered maturities. One credit line for $1.25 billion has been renewed through 2027 and the renewal of the second credit line was finalized last Friday at a reduced amount of $915 million with the term extended to April 2029. As expected in these times, several banks dropped out. We use our credit lines very sparingly, generally for short-term requirements with a known source of repayment, and rarely have we exceeded 25% drawdowns. Now to 280 Park Avenue. We own 50% of 280 Park Avenue. Since our joint venture partner has already reported, I'm guessing you are all pretty much up to date on the details."", ""What we did here was extend the maturity of the senior loan for four years, keeping the rate constant with no paydown, but posting significant cash reserves for future leasing. Several analysts have commented that the loan and the equity value pretty much cancel out. And that fact allowed us to DPO the mezz loan at $0.50 on the dollar, realizing a $31.3 million gain at share, which we will recognize in the second quarter. This is not yet a big win, but it does create a cheap warrant on a wonderful asset located in prime Park Avenue, where there is already a very low 7% vacancy and a shortage of space. We think it's a first-class bet. By the way, we are leasing very well here. We continue to protect our balance sheet with interest rate caps and swaps, but when a 3% loan matures into a 7% market, there really is no place to hide."", ""We continue to prospect for good real estate in distress, where our best-in-class operating platform can be helpful to the lender. We expect these opportunities to accelerate. The gold rush on the part of the luxury brands to own, control, and dominate the very best locations is accelerating and the knock-on effect on prime New York City retail space is palpable. It should be noted that in New York, we have much more prime retail space than anyone else by a wide margin. Some commentators have noted that the Fifth Avenue and Times Square values seem to have recovered to the pricing of our retail JV sale five years ago. It would seem so. I continue to strongly believe the contrarian bull case I made in my annual shareholders letter that basically with frozen supply, i.e., no new developer office starts and none in -- on the horizon, tenant requirements picking up and vacancies shrinking, I couldn't be more optimistic about the future."", ""And also note that while the New York market has a huge 422 million square feet, when you cancel out the non-prime space, we really only compete in a much smaller 177 million square foot market. Great things are happening in our PENN District. Come by and take a look. Our team here at Vornado couldn't be more optimistic. Now, over to Michael."", ""Michael Franco: Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. As expected, the financial results for the quarter were down from last year due to items that we previously forecasted. First quarter comparable FFO, as adjusted, was $0.55 per share compared to $0.60 per share for last year's first quarter, a decrease of $0.05. This decrease was primarily driven by lower NOI from higher net interest expense and no move-outs, partially offset by lower G&A expense. We have provided a quarter-over-quarter bridge in our earnings release and our financial supplement. Our overall New York business same-store cash NOI was down 5.1%, primarily due to the aforementioned expirations. As we indicated on our last earnings call, we expect our 2024 comparable FFO to be down from 2023 comparable FFO of $2.61 per share, primarily due to higher projected net interest expense of about $0.30 per share and the impact of known vacancies at certain of our properties, primarily at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, 770 Broadway, and 280 Park Avenue."", ""We anticipate the impact of these expirations in 2024 to be roughly $0.25 to $0.30 per share. We expect this impact to be temporary as we have already leased up a good chunk of this space, but the GAAP earnings from these leases won't begin until sometime in 2025. We then expect earnings to increase as income from the lease-up of PENN and other vacancies comes online and as rates trend down. Now, turning to leasing markets. The New York office market continues to show signs of strengthening. While first quarter office leasing in New York took a bit of a breather from the strong year-end, there is a healthy backlog of activity with a number of large deals in the works. Overall, tenant space requirements continue to trend upward, sub-lease space continues to fall, best-in-class renovated and amenitized product located in transit hubs continues to dominate leasing and the new supply pipeline is close to zero."", 'These dynamics set the table for continued improvement in conditions in the upper tier of the market, which we are already experiencing in our best-of-class portfolio. Overall, asking rents are stable, even rising in the top-tier properties, but concessions remain stubbornly high across all submarkets. The financial services and legal sectors are continuing to drive the leasing activity, as both are in growth mode. We are also seeing the first signs of life in the tech sector again after a couple of years of being on pause or downsizing. And our experience is, when they grow, they tend to lease big chunks of space. The Midtown and New West Side markets are outperforming as leasing activity in Midtown is strong, not only on Park Avenue, but also on Sixth Avenue and the Fifth Avenue, Madison Avenue corridor.', ""On the West Side, tenant demand continues apace. If you walk from Seventh Avenue to the Hudson River, you will see why. Turning now to our leasing activity. After completing a slew of large leases in December 2023 and finishing last year with a market-leading 2.1 million square feet of deals, we expected a more muted first quarter of completed transactions, given where our deal pipeline stood in the negotiation process. In the first quarter, we leased 291,000 square feet at a healthy $89 per square-foot, reflecting the overall quality and premium locations of our properties. The highlight of the quarter was our 125,000 square foot headquarters lease with Major League Soccer at the new PENN 2. MLS had been in the market for some time, looking mainly in the Midtown core until late in their process when they toured PENN 2 and were wowed by what we've done with the building and the district."", ""The project is now complete and really shows terrifically. Our new town hall events space is open. By the way, we hosted our first event just two weeks ago, attended by 300 people. And the rooftop pavilion and park are truly spectacular. Tenants are responding positively to everything that we've done and what's still to come. We have a significant pipeline at PENN 2 and are busy negotiating proposals with tenants across a variety of industry sectors. In addition to the significant Bloomberg lease renewal of almost 1 million square feet we just completed, our leasing pipeline is strong, with 370,000 feet of leases in negotiation and another 2.5 million feet of proposals out on the street in different stages. Much of this activity is not only addressing current vacancy, but also forward-looking expirations."", ""As discussed on the fourth quarter call, we foreshadowed an occupancy decline due to the known Q1 move-outs at properties such as 1296 Avenue and 280 Park. We are pleased to report that we have already taken care of half the 2024 and 2025 expirations in these properties, with more activity on the horizon at each. Turning to retail. The retail leasing market continues to recover. As we discussed on our last call, Prada and Kering's blockbuster retail deals on Fifth Avenue that occurred in December demonstrated their long-term commitment to Manhattan and has further energized the market. And there are other potential sales rumored to be in the works. Vacancy rates are now below pre-pandemic 2019 levels in most Manhattan submarkets, and retailers are willing to pay top dollar for the best locations."", ""Our retail leasing activity has picked up meaningfully in the last couple of quarters, with almost all our assets seeing significant interest. As evidence of the rebound, this quarter, in addition to signing many leases in the PENN District, we completed an important long-term renewal at one of our Times Square assets at the highest annual dollar rent we've achieved in our portfolio since pre-COVID, over $15 million per year. Turning to the capital markets now. While the financing markets still remain challenging, we are starting to see some stability for high-quality product. The CMBS market has begun to selectively reopen for office, lending at conservative metrics on quality assets with long weighted average lease term. Unsecured bond spreads for office continue to tighten."", ""The market is much more open for high quality retail. That being said, coupons are still high. Banks remain on the sidelines and generally in workout mode, and there's more pain to come for all lenders, given the volume of office maturities in the next few years. This will create opportunities for us. We have been and continue to be very active on the capital markets front. In addition to the recent extensions on 280 Park and 435 Seventh, we're also in the process of extending our other 2024 maturities, which we expect to complete soon. Finally, and importantly, as Steve mentioned, just a few days ago, we finalized the recast of our revolver that was scheduled to mature in 2026 for $915 million. Completing this refinancing solidified a key portion of our liquidity through 2029 and gives us significant runway to deal with any challenges over the next few years."", ""It also highlights the continued support of our key banks in this challenging environment. We thank them for their support. Our balance sheet remains in very good shape with strong liquidity. Pro forma for the new revolver size, our current liquidity is a strong $2.7 billion, including $1.1 billion of cash and restricted cash and $1.6 billion undrawn under our $2.17 billion revolving credit facilities. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A."", 'See also', '15 Countries with the Highest Life Expectancy in Asia and', '30 Countries that Receive the Most Aid from UNDP.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

Handel Saint, just senior equity research analyst at Mizuho cover reits alongside Gregory.Cool global real estate portfolio manager at Janice.He Henderson investors.Welcome to you both.And Greg, maybe I'll start with you.Um uh Listen, we talked reeds, obviously a lot of very interesting verticals, Greg to get into there, but maybe you saw a big picture 30,000 ft view.Uh Greg, how are you thinking about reeds in general?Are you, are you general broadly bullish here, Greg?Hi, thanks for having me.You know, I I would say yes with the right time frame.So I think what's really important to remember about res is uh you know, this is an in interest rate sensitive asset class.Um And as we talk about listed res we reprice every day in the market versus maybe private real estate.That doesn't.Right.So the good news there is that as we've seen a huge shift in fed policy and underlying interest rates over the last couple of years, we've seen listed res repriced downwards to reflect that.And you kind of reference that in your opening comments as we look forward.I think we're pretty optimistic that assuming we are done in terms of uh fed rate hikes and higher rates listed reach today, our price for the interest rate environment that we have, which means they can do well.And just to give you a sense, you know, since the beginning of 2021 our sector is down roughly 20% on a total return basis at the same time, re cash flow per share has grown in the, in the mid teens cumulative on that on that time period.So it's not an issue of fundamentals, it's purely an issue of valuation which we think we're getting towards the end of.And I would ask your opinion on the sort of relationship between rates and these stocks as well because even if the fed has done hiking, if rates are going to continue to sort of hover at these levels for a while, is that going to be problematic for the sector?Uh Yeah, absolutely.I think that there certainly has been a concern that with rates appearing to be set, you know, higher for longer, we came into this year with expectation of five or six rate cuts.Now we're down to maybe basically zero.But if we have rates that are higher for longer with stickier inflation and a slowing growth backdrop, uh there have been some concerns raised that, you know, that is an ideal uh for, for real estate.So certainly that's something that's on investors' minds.Um And, you know, we, we would point people to, you know, sectors where there's clear demand, tail winds, you know, apartments, health care, uh data centers and stocks are names with uh pricing power, uh better than average earnings growth to alleviate some of those concerns.And Greg, I wanna bring you back here and actually go, go right there when you kind of lift the hood here, Greg.What parts of the market do you find attractive here?Right now?I is it housing health care data center office?I think all of those are attractive on a long term basis maybe with the, you know, potential exception of office, but even office at the right price can be interesting.And you've seen actually office stocks do really well, you know, I think to highlight a few that we really like at the moment, uh I would say some of the more specialty property types, something like self storage res where, you know, we think that uh we're in the process of a bottoming out there on a fundamental basis.And that's a really good long term business that we like uh with really low Capex Handel mentioned health care, you know, we also like that quite a bit.The the demographic story of kind of the 80 years and over demographic paints a really positive picture for demand for health care reps. At the same time, supply of assisted living and and senior housing.Uh it is is almost as low as it's been in, in, you know, a decade.So that's really good.And then, you know, the the third area I highlight is maybe more of a specialty situation.Um you know, at the right price, even something like malls can be interesting.So we, you know, one stock that we like in particular is Macerich, which trades at a very large discount to its only public tier in, in Simon.There's a new management team at that company Malls is a business that we don't think is particularly great long term, but we also think it's not terrible if you own the best malls.And so that's a specific situation where the public markets are giving you something at a really good price in our view.Um And maybe something else that is counterintuitive to a broader narrative is multifamily and gel.There you like a couple of stocks um in that subsector.Why, why multifamily, what and for for the late people, multi family is what we'd like to call apartment buildings where you have a lot of families living.What, why is that a good area to look right now?Sure.Sure.So, yeah, we've all lived in apartments at some point or another in our lives.But, uh, it's a subsector that's underperformed the last couple of years as, you know, the earnings growth of fundamentals.We're slowing, we're getting to the near the end of that.Actually, we've seen an inflection in the road ahead.There have been pockets of, you know, oversupply in certain regions, the sunbelt, in particular, Seattle certain markets around the country.So that concern is still out there, but there's been really strong job growth this year.So the absorption of those excess units has been a bit better than feared.And so we think that with getting past the peak supply and we're about to pass that either second or third quarter depending on which market you're looking at plus the inflection uh with better rents and then eventually earnings growth in the road ahead and thinking about where the stocks are trading today at meaningful discounts that are long term averages to the private market values.And that's by the way, is on trough revenue and trough earnings uh that the sector could be at the beginning of a multi year recovery and stepping back thinking about the alternatives in the marketplace, uh there is generally a shortage of housing in this country.Uh demographics uh certainly support uh an immigration uh demand for uh for, for housing, but thinking about the affordability of single family housing with the mortgage rates near 7%.So that's an additional uh tail winner support for the renter ship side of the business.Greg bringing back in here, I'm interested internationally any opportunities, Greg, any spots China Europe or, or no, you'd rather stay here in the US.Yeah, I think there's plenty of opportunity internationally in, in a couple of areas, you know, China is one that, that we've probably shied away from a little bit more in recent years.But you know, the opportunities are are a little bit different in Europe and Asia.So I think in Europe, you have stocks that trade at really interesting valuations, you maybe have less of the quality compounding growth stories there.Although they do exist to us, that's a valuation story and, and that's pretty interesting at the moment and then Asia is somewhat similar, it's a bit a bit in between the US and Europe in terms of a mix of valuation and also really high quality kind of growth with within res.The biggest thing though, maybe to think about in those markets is just the overall maturity of the listed reed space in the US versus XU reeds have been around a lot longer in the US.It's a lot more mature business than it has been outside the US.And if you think back to sort of the nineties and the, and the earlier part of the two thousands owning the stocks through that maturation process to where we are today in the US has been a really good experience for, for investors.We think the same thing can be said for X US uh in the decades ahead, Greg Handel.Thank you guys both so much for joining the show today.That was a great chat.Appreciate it.Thanks for having us.Thank you.""]"

The index stayed below the 5,200 level it had briefly reached earlier in the week, reflecting a loss of momentum in the stock market. The day's trading was characterized by fluctuations, with notable declines in major technology companies such as Nvidia and Tesla. These losses played a role in tempering Wall Street's enthusiasm for stocks. Uber Technologies also suffered a sharp drop after reporting disappointing first-quarter bookings, while Intel saw a decline due to a downgraded revenue outlook in light of a U.S. ban on chip exports to Huawei Technologies. At the same time, oil prices reversed earlier losses after a decline in U.S. stockpiles suggested a tightening market. West Texas Intermediate crude traded above $78 a barrel as the Energy Information Administration reported a reduction of 1.36 million barrels in inventories. This shift in the oil market is seen as a bullish indicator amid generally bearish technical trends. These factors reflect an inflection point in the market, as investors reassess their positions amid evolving economic conditions, corporate performance concerns, and changes in the oil market. Futures positioning has raised doubts about the strength of the S&P 500's recent gains, suggesting that some investors are more cautious about the sustainability of the rally."", ""On May 8, an official from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expressed concern over the growing divisions between the United States and China, warning that their trade tensions could hinder global economic growth. The U.S. has heightened trade restrictions and sanctions on China, citing national security concerns and ongoing disputes in the South China Sea and around Taiwan, reported CNBC. IMF Deputy Managing Director Gita Gopinath noted that trade relations between the U.S.-led Western bloc and the China-aligned bloc have weakened since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Trade between these blocs has decreased by roughly 12%, and foreign direct investment has fallen by 20% compared to levels within these groups. The IMF estimates that, in the most extreme scenario, these divisions could cost the world up to 7% of its GDP. The pandemic and geopolitical strife have disrupted international trade patterns not seen since the Cold War, according to Gopinath. Increasingly, countries are focusing on economic and national security when making trade and investment decisions. This trend threatens to undermine a rules-based global trading system and the benefits of economic integration. However, while the global economy faces significant challenges due to fragmentation, the overall trade-to-GDP ratio has been relatively stable over the past two decades. This stability is partly due to the role of neutral countries like Mexico and Vietnam, which act as connectors for rerouting trade and investment between the U.S. and China. These non-aligned nations leverage their economic and diplomatic influence to help keep the world economy integrated. The presence of these neutral mediators may serve as a buffer against the full impact of the ongoing U.S.-China tensions, providing a pathway for continued international cooperation and trade."", 'On the stock market front, analysts are bullish on stocks such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), ServiceNow, Inc.

We think the market is cautious about the Company’s results for 2024 because they will be lapping very high levels of growth compared to those in 2023 (full year 2023 bookings growth +24%). However, Booking’s end markets continue to be quite healthy, outside of geographies affected by war because consumers still have plenty of wallet share to re-dedicate to travel compared to pre-COVID-19 numbers.

Even better, those rewards are often easy to earn through credit cards. Here are just a few of the ways your cards can get you to Italy."", ""The simplest way to make your Italy trip happen with travel credit cards is to redeem your points through the issuer's travel portal. These are the four most popular programs:"", 'Featured offer: save money while you pay off debt with one of these top-rated balance transfer credit cards', 'American Express Membership Rewards', 'Capital One Venture Rewards', 'Chase Ultimate Rewards', 'Citi ThankYou Rewards', ""This method is nice because you don't need to look for special award tickets; you can simply choose the flights (and hotel, and rental car) that works for you and use points to pay for it. Plus, it's great for keeping your out-of-pocket costs to a minimum since you can typically cover all of the costs -- right down to the fees -- with your rewards."", ""The downside here is that you won't be maximizing the value of your points. Transferring your credit card rewards to an airline frequent flyer program, then redeeming those miles for travel, can often score you a higher per-point return."", ""The most popular way to fly for free is through airline miles, either transferred from a travel card or earned directly (by flying or with a co-branded airline credit card). Every airline I've come across has a frequent flyer program that lets you book flights using rewards."", ""The potential for fees: If you're using airline miles to book a flight, be prepared to pay at least a small amount in cash to cover applicable taxes and fees. Often, it's nominal; you might pay $5 or $10. Other times it's ridiculous. For instance, most flights to or from (or even through) the UK have outlandish surcharges: I've seen them reach $1,000 or more on a one-way business flight."", 'The cheapest flights to Italy came from American Airlines. I found nonstop business class availability this fall going to Rome and Milan from a few U.S. hubs for just 65,000 AA miles plus $5.60 in fees.', ""Unfortunately, AA isn't a regular transfer partner of the four credit card programs. That said, you can earn AA miles through any AAdvantage co-branded airline cards. AA offers both personal and business cards."", 'American Airlines is part of the Oneworld airline alliance, which also includes British Airways and Ibera. As such, you can book AA flights through the BA or Iberia websites using Avios points. Amex and Chase will transfer to both airlines, giving you a roundabout way to use transferable points to book American Airlines.', ""The consideration here is you may need to fork over both more rewards and more cash if you go this route. For instance, the above flight from AA would run you 77,250 Avios plus $232.80 in fees when booked through Iberia. If you want an option that lets you transfer points, however, it's definitely still a great deal for business class to Europe."", 'Another decent deal was from United Airlines with business class flights (with various layovers) starting at 88,000 United miles plus $12.50 in fees.

And none of the major programs transfer to ITA Volare, either."", ""However, last year, Virgin Atlantic and ITA announced a partnership that would let you cross-book the airlines via the other's rewards.

Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.', ""So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Eaton (NYSE:ETN).

This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value."", ""For growth investors, Eaton's raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night.

Growing dividends for half a century demands significant dedication and financial stability. Hence, only 54 out of 4,000 publicly traded companies in the US have managed to accomplish this feat of sustained dividend growth. Moreover, these companies have raised and maintained their dividends despite enduring seven recessions over the past five decades, including the Black Monday in 1987, the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, and the Coronavirus Crash of 2020. The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) are some of the best dividend kings with decades-long dividend growth streaks.', 'Companies that have the ability to raise their dividends have shown resilience and stability over time. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks the performance of companies with 25 or more consecutive years of dividend growth, has outperformed the S&P 500 since its inception in 2005. According to a report by ProShares, the initial investment of $10,000 made in 2005 in the index could have potentially grown to over $61,000 by March 2021. Moreover, the index has surpassed the broader market in performance during eight out of the ten most significant quarterly downturns since 2005. The report also mentioned that the companies in the Dividend Aristocrats Index have grown their dividends at an annual average rate of 8.3% between 2005 and 2022, compared with a 6.7% annual average dividend growth rate of the S&P 500 companies.', 'Investors have been actively seeking dividend growth stocks because of their capacity to provide consistent and increasing income over time. As corporate balance sheets are showing strength, many companies in the US are steadily growing their dividends. According to the latest data from S&P Dow Jones Indices, the companies in the S&P 500 distributed $151.6 billion in dividends in the first quarter of 2024, up from $146.8 billion during the same period last year. The report further mentioned that total dividend increases were $22.7 billion for the quarter, compared with $19.7 billion in the first quarter of 2023. Howard Silverblatt, Senior Index Analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, has given a strong outlook for dividend growth this year, especially for large-cap companies. Here is what he said:', '“Absent an economic or geopolitical event, dividend growth is expected to selectively continue. S&P 500 large caps appear to be weathering uncertainty and volatility better. The index is expected to post a 6% increase in payments for 2024 compared to its 5.1% increase in 2023 and the 10.8% increase seen in 2022.""', ""Generating income from dividend stocks is not a quick process; it mainly requires patience and a long-term investment approach. Dividend stocks are ideal for long-term investors as these equities have outpaced inflation over the years. Morningstar cited data from Yale University's Robert Shiller and revealed that since 1871, dividends per share in the S&P 500 have increased at an annualized rate of 1.6 percentage points faster than inflation. In addition to this, the advantage of dividend growth over inflation has strengthened in recent years.

But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus."", ""While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns."", 'American Water Works in Focus', ""American Water Works (AWK) is headquartered in Camden, and is in the Utilities sector. The stock has seen a price change of -0.13% since the start of the year. The water utility is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.71 per share, with a dividend yield of 2.15%.

American Water Works has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 8.72%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. American Water Works's current payout ratio is 57%. This means it paid out 57% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend."", 'Looking at this fiscal year, AWK expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 is $5.24 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 6.94%.', 'Bottom Line', 'Investors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.', 'High-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, AWK is a compelling investment opportunity.

However, net income attributable to common stockholders saw a decline to $473 million from $663 million in Q1 2023, influenced by higher income attributable to noncontrolling interests, particularly in its Indonesian operations.

These costs represent a financial burden that the company must manage effectively to improve its net income margins."", ""Dependence on Copper Market Fluctuations: FCX's heavy reliance on copper sales makes it susceptible to price volatility in the global copper market.

A delivery giant is searching for a new CFO.', 'UPS (no. 37 on the Fortune 500) announced on Monday that Brian Newman, CFO since 2019, will leave the company on June 1, for medical reasons.', '“I am honored to have served as CFO of such a storied company with so many great leaders around the world,” Newman said in a statement. “I am confident in the company’s continued success and growth trajectory. My near-term priority is to focus on my health.”', 'Before joining UPS, Newman spent 26 years with PepsiCo serving in finance leadership roles such as EVP for PepsiCo’s Global Operations, and launching initiatives like PepsiCo’s global e-commerce business. Newman, a dual citizen of the U.S. and Ireland, began his career as an investment banker working for PaineWebber in New York City.', 'UPS CEO Carol Tomé said in a statement that Newman has been “a great partner"" and helped to guide the company through unprecedented economic conditions. She added that Newman has left the company “well-positioned"" as UPS continues to implement its ""1+2 strategy,"" focusing on sales and profit growth and increasing operating margins.', 'UPS said in the announcement that they will evaluate internal and external CFO candidates to replace Newman. The new finance chief will become the strategic partner to Tomé, who is a former longtime CFO. Before UPS, she had spent nearly 25 years at Home Depot, where she held the CFO title for 18 years.', ""Tomé retired as CFO of Home Depot in 2019, keeping the board seat she has held at UPS since 2003. But in 2020 as the pandemic raged, she came out of retirement to run UPS as the first woman CEO in the company's history. The move gave the company a powerhouse chief executive, who earned a spot on Fortune’s Most Powerful Women list."", ""During her tenure as CFO at Home Depot, Tomé is credited with helping to deliver a 450% increase in the company's shareholder value, and guiding the company through the 2008 recession.\xa0“I learned that the answer to really all of the strategic questions facing a company can be found by listening,” Tomé told Fortune in 2020. “In my free time, in the evenings, on the weekends, I would put on an apron and work in [Home Depot] stores.”"", 'So Tomé’ will seemingly play a major role in the UPS search for a new CFO. “Having former CFOs on the board is a huge asset whether or not a company needs a new CFO,” Shawn Cole, president and founding partner of Cowen Partners, a C-suite-focused executive search firm, told me.', 'But there’s also a potential drawback. “Former CFOs have a habit of emulating themselves,” Cole said. That could be counterproductive if it doesn’t fit the CFO candidate profile the company requires, he said. Having an open mind is key, Cole said.', 'Whoever is chosen as the next CFO of UPS will have much work to do. The delivery giant released its first-quarter earnings report on April 23, and the company’s “overall performance was in line with our expectations,” Newman said in a recent LinkedIn post. Revenue was $21.7 billion, down 5.3% compared to the first quarter of 2023. Profits for the quarter were $1.43 per share, down 35% below the same period last year.', 'The company narrowly avoided a labor strike last year by brokering a contract that gave UPS workers higher wages and improved working conditions. (In the first quarter of 2023, prior to union negotiations, revenue crossed $100 billion for the first time since its founding.) UPS plans to cut 12,000 mostly management positions. By 2026, the company aims to grow revenue to between $108 million and $114 billion, and an operating margin above 13%.

The trial’s secondary endpoints include hearing improvement, measured using auditory brainstem response (ABR) and behavioural audiometry with pure-tone audiometry (PTA).', 'At 24 weeks, the younger child observed improvement of hearing to normal levels, with an average 80 decibels (dB) improvement from baseline.

The surgical procedure and the gene therapy were well tolerated, with no treatment-related adverse events or serious adverse events.', 'DB-OTO is an adeno-associated virus gene therapy designed to restore hearing in patients with congenital otoferlin hearing loss.

(NYSE:AMP) reveals that 94% of couples have shared retirement goals, and observe the same financial values, but overlook the importance of delving into the intricacies of such an important phase of life. The Ameriprise Financial, Inc.

Some couples avoid discussing these topics because they feel overwhelmed – especially knowing that unexpected events can happen at any time – but putting it off can lead to challenges down the road.”', '- Marcy Keckler, CFP®, CRPCTM, RICP®, Senior Vice President of Financial Advice Strategy at Ameriprise Financial, Inc.

Nearly two-thirds of American workers risk outliving their retirement savings anyway, according to a 2024 BlackRock Read on Retirement™ survey by BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK).

And yet the industry has focused on helping people understand they need to save – but not how to manage spending in retirement, even as companies have shifted from defined benefit to defined contribution plans. With this solution, we’re rethinking retirement. And part of that was working across the industry to build something new”.', '-Anne Ackerley, Head of Retirement at BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK)', 'With solutions like these, Americans are more likely to be stressed about their retirement savings, as they will have a better understanding of their retirement income.

For many retirees, living in states with higher costs of living could become a more viable option with the assurance of a steady income stream.', ""There are many pros and cons of retiring to New York State. Some of the advantages include age-friendliness, walkability, and culture. However, retirees don't appreciate it because of its cold winters and high cost of living.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Vlad."", 'Vladimir G. Shmunis', ""Good afternoon, and welcome to our first quarter conference call. We had a solid start to the year. In Q1, Total revenue rose 9% to $584 million, above the high end of our outlook. ARR rose 10% to $2.4 billion, with enterprise up 13% for the fourth consecutive quarter. Consistent with our strategy of driving profitable growth, we delivered a record quarter of profitability with operating margin rising to approximately 21%, which was well above our outlook for Q1. I am also proud of the material progress we have made on reducing stock-based compensation as we have delivered another quarter of year-over-year improvement in SBC as a percent of revenue. Our execution in driving profitable growth has already resulted in an approximately 4x year-over-year increase in non-GAAP operating profit less SBC. Improvements in SBC, combined with our share repurchase program, is expected to result in our full year fully diluted share count declining year-over-year for the first time in our history. Speaking of making history. I'm excited to share that in Q1, we signed our largest UCaaS seat deal ever. We won a competitive RFP and sold 40,000 seats to a Fortune 500 retailer with over $20 billion in revenue. With RingCentral, this customer will be able to address their main pain points, which include dropped call, long hold times, inadequate call reporting and lack of advanced voice features. In this megadeal win, RingCentral will be replacing their legacy solution, Skype for Business, demonstrating our ability to win against Teams Phone while operating within the Team's ecosystem. In fact, the majority of our enterprise customers have Teams. And in Q1, more than half of our large $1 million TCV deals were to customers that are utilizing our solutions integrated with and alongside Microsoft Teams. Importantly, this win was in one of our gold verticals, which include health care, financial and professional services, retail and public sector. We are mission-critical in this vertical and we win given our unmatched reliability, ability to solve complex use cases, our integrated UCaaS and CCaaS platforms and our thousands of available integrations. This vertical has been a key growth driver, especially in enterprise. And we believe that there are at least 100 million seats in this vertical that we can convert over time. Let me now give you more color on why we win, which is centered around our guiding principles of trust, innovation and partnerships or TIP as we call it. First, trust. We achieved 5 NICE uptime for the 23rd straight quarter. In fact, over the past year, we've reached a new milestone of 6 NICE. Our cloud platform is carrier-grade, secure, standard compliance and battle-tested and continues to be a wide competitive moat and the key differentiator. Another core strength is our ability to solve complex use cases and integrate into customers' commonly used horizontal and vertical-specific applications, especially in our gold verticals. We offer these customers a large breadth of business communications API as well as industry-specific integration, workflows and certification. For example, within the health care vertical, we integrate into patient data management applications such as EPIC and Cerner as well as [meet], HITRUST and HIPAA compliance requirements. These customers can create workflows based on their specific needs of their businesses. For example, health care providers can use RingCentral's API to send prescriptions directly to the pharmacy system electronically and automatically trigger appointment reminders via SMS. Additionally, our market-leading UCaaS solution integrated with the CCaaS platform supports a wide variety of use cases and is also a vital differentiator. With RingCentral, companies have the ability to streamline workflows with our advanced tools and integration. This was the key factor in why Sanitas, a Fortune 500 operator of medical centers in the U.S. selected RingCentral this quarter to power its communications platform. With RingCentral, Sanitas will be able to provide their customers with the unified, seamless experience across interactions such as scheduling, billing and general inquiries. We believe this should drive increased revenue and patient retention from improved customer experiences as well as lower cost from the increase in employee efficiencies that our industry-leading integrated UCaaS and CCaS platform provides. These are just 2 examples of our robust progress in new customer acquisition activity in Q1. But equally as important is our ability to retain existing customers and maximize customer lifetime value. On this point, our renewed focus on customer care is resulting in improved gross retention and better NPS scores. The combination of better gross retention, improving macro trends and the introduction of our new products should drive higher net retention going forward. Now on to innovation. This past quarter, we announced a name change of our flagship industry-leading UCaaS solution from MVP to RingEX, which stands for RingCentral Employee Experience. With this change, we are signaling our commitment to continuous innovation based on emerging generative AI technologies. We started off on a high note with RingEX with RingSense AI as we won the overall best of Enterprise Connect Award in March. One key reason we won is because of our differentiated industry-first, real-time AI for voice interaction. With this feature, users are able to capture key decisions and track action items in real time, enabling on the spot referencing and heightened accuracy. It is early days, but users are already seeing significant time savings. For example, one customer highlighted that for an average 20-minute call, real-time notes saved them 5 minutes post call, while also keeping all their notes attached to the context to allow for easy referencing in future interactions. Voice-driven data historically has been largely inaccessible at scale as the data has been siloed. With RingSense AI now being an integral part of RingEX, we empower customers to take advantage of the billions of minutes of conversations that take place on our platform. Our customers will now be able to automate manual tasks, unlock deeper insights and create more streamlined employee and customer workflows. Continuing on the theme of innovation, let me now share progress on our new products. First, RingCX, our AI-powered contact center, which is simple to use and easy to deploy and which provides agents with all-in-one capabilities across 20-plus digital channels, automatic screen pops, contact matching the CRM, case and ticket creation and interaction logging for all voice and digital interactions, all from an intuitive user interface.We now have over 200 RingCX customers, almost double versus fourth quarter 2023. RingCX is now available in 6 countries: the U.S., Canada, the U.K., France, Germany and most recently, Australia. In fact, one of our newest RingCX customer is from outside the U.S. Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council in the United Kingdom, they purchased over 200 RingCX seats and over 3,000 RingEX licenses in Q1. Two key factors for our win. One, our unmatched reliability as their prior cloud provider had consistent outages; and two, our fully integrated RingEX and RingCX solution. They will be using RingCX to provide a range of services for their almost 300,000 residents, including addressing income and social care planning, housing and business regulation and enforcement questions. We are rapidly innovating with RingCX. We added over 300 features in Q1, bringing the total to over 1,000. Among the new features of RingCX are native integration into Salesforce, HubSpot, ServiceNow, Zendesk and Microsoft Dynamics. We have also opened the RingCX platform to enable a growing ecosystem of partners such as Google, Dialogflow, Cognigy, Yellow.ai, Balto and Calabrio. Our strength in voice, ease of deployment, use and maintenance and our attractive pricing and packaging give us confidence that we will continue to see positive results from RingCX going forward. We also continue to see good traction with RingSense for Sales, our first product in the RingSense portfolio. We have more than doubled our customer count sequentially in Q1 to over 600. Many customers are benefiting from the automated interaction summaries, follow-up notifications, call scoring, sentiment analysis and performance management. This frees up sales people's time, allowing them to focus on selling versus performing administrative tasks. For example, an insurance agency in the Midwest is using the AI-driven insight for RingSense for Sales to gain visibility into what's working and not working in the agency's sales and client services practices. RingSense is able to monitor and glean insights from all their voice data, tone, word choice, energy sentiment, helping the customer identify valuable insights they would not have caught by listening to a random selection of agent conversations. And within our own sales organization, we are seeing RingSense for Sales, deliver both productivity and efficiency gains. Our employees are now able to save at least 2 hours a week or about 1 full workday a month from using RingSense's automated note summary features. That is one extra day to speak with customers and potentially win more deals. Lastly, events, which provides us with the opportunity to expand into new personas outside of our typical base, including line of business decision-makers. RingCentral Events saw a roughly 25% sequential increase in new logos in the first quarter. New AI features for Events such as AI-writer and Q&A categorization further enhance the value that customers receive. These features also continue to differentiate RingCentral from the competition and were important contributors to customers such as the Detroit Pistons, Vanderbilt University, a Fortune 50 technology company and one of the largest media companies in the world, selecting RingCentral Events during the first quarter. Last but not least, partnerships, which are a key to continue to scale our multiproduct business. We have a diverse network of partners, which includes over 15,000 channel partners, a number of large strategic OEM partners, AWS and some of the largest global service providers, which include AT&T, BT, Charter Communications, Deutsche Telekom, Telus and Vodafone. We also continue to expand this network and announced our new partnership with Optus, Australia's second largest provider of telecommunication services during the first quarter. GSPs are a key growth driver for RingCentral and are growing above our overall growth rate. We saw good traction with this cohort in Q1, including with Vodafone, where we won a 1,000 seat-plus deal with a large European retailer. Regarding Avaya, they continue to be the world's largest holder of on-prem UC and CC seats. RingCentral continues to be Avaya's exclusive UCaaS provider. And in Q1, we extended the term of our multiyear agreement and enhanced our GTM and innovation collaboration model. We expect to work even more closely with Avaya to position, market and sell Avaya Cloud Office by RingCentral to the million of existing Avaya on-prem users. Stay tuned for additional joint product announcements at the upcoming Avaya ENGAGE conference next week. We believe that as a whole, our broad partner network will be an important contributor to our continued profitable growth. In closing, Q1 was solid. We are executing on all our strategic priorities. Our core growth is stabilizing, our new products are demonstrating traction, our SBC is improving, and our free cash flow is expanding, demonstrating the strength of our business and its inherent profitability. I'm very excited about our future. With that, let me turn the call over to Sonalee."", 'Sonalee Elizabeth Parekh', ""Thanks, Vlad. I'll provide highlights from the first quarter and then discuss our business outlook for the second quarter and full year. In Q1, subscription revenue of $557 million was up 10% year-over-year, above the high end of our guidance range. ARR of $2.37 billion was up 10% versus last year. On a year-over-year basis, currency was neutral while on a sequential basis, currency represented an almost $10 million headwind. Enterprise ARR continues to perform well and rose 13% versus last year, to $1.02 billion. We saw good traction with large customers, winning many $1 million-plus TCV deals in our gold verticals. As Vlad highlighted, this includes a new Fortune 500 retailer that has committed to spending more than 8 figures with us over the next few years. Now moving to profitability. I'll be referring to non-GAAP results unless otherwise noted. Subscription gross margin was 82%, consistent with prior quarters. Overall ARPU was again above $30. Our new product ARPUs are solidly higher than current overall ARPUs. Over time, we expect new products to become increasingly accretive to overall ARPU and retention. Operating margin rose 350 basis points versus last year to 20.7%, solidly above our guidance of 19.5%. The outperformance was driven by upside to our revenue guidance as well as the timing of certain operating expenses. Importantly, we continue to remain disciplined in our spending in particular, within sales and marketing. Moving to free cash flow. We are now reporting and will guide to free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capitalized expenditures. This more closely reflects the cash flow generation of our business in a given period and includes cash paid for interest and other nonrecurring items, such as restructuring, which we will call out separately. In the first quarter of 2024, we generated free cash flow of $77 million. This is net of cash paid for interest of $23 million and nonrecurring payments of $15 million as well as $10 million of cash received from certain strategic partners. Excluding the impact of interest and these nonrecurring items, free cash flow would have been $105 million compared to $61 million in the first quarter of 2023, representing over 70% growth. Moving to stock-based compensation. As a percent of total revenue, stock-based compensation fell to 15.6%, down 340 basis points versus last year. We also remain disciplined on stock grants to both new and existing employees and continue to expect new grants, net of forfeitures, in 2024 to be about half of 2023 levels. Moving to our balance sheet. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.4 million shares for $80 million under the plan previously authorized by our Board of Directors. Recently, our Board increased our repurchase authorization by an incremental $250 million. We currently have approximately $375 million remaining on our total authorization. Given our current valuation, strong and growing free cash flow, and the significant progress we have made to bring down our leverage, we believe that share repurchase provides an attractive relative return. Moving to our convert. We had [161 million] of our 2025 convertible notes outstanding on March 31. There is no change in our plan shared last quarter to utilize our existing liquidity sources and a portion of our free cash flow to retire the 2025 convert prior to its maturity date in March 2025. Our net leverage ratio which declined year-over-year by over 1 turn to 2.5x at the end of Q1 2024, continues to trend downward as we expand our adjusted EBITDA and reduce gross debt. Our low and improving leverage ratio, strong BB credit rating, significant liquidity and strong free cash flow growth gives us flexibility and a range of alternatives for addressing our 2026 convertible notes. Now let me turn to guidance. Embedded in our guidance is the expectation that the macro environment and current business trends remain relatively stable with no further material improvement or deterioration in conditions. With that backdrop, for the second quarter of 2024, we expect subscription revenue growth of 9%; total revenue growth of 8% to 9%, non-GAAP operating margin of 20.7%, flat versus the first quarter of 2024 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.87 to $0.88. For the full year, we are raising our revenue outlook to reflect our Q1 revenue outperformance. We now expect subscription revenue of $2.267 billion to $2.287 billion, representing growth of 8% to 9% and total revenue of $2.379 billion to $2.399 billion, representing annual growth of 8% to 9%. We continue to expect non-GAAP operating margin of 21% and stock-based compensation as a percentage of total revenue of approximately 16%. We are raising our non-GAAP EPS to $3.59 to $3.67, up from $3.50 to $3.58, as we now expect 96 million to 97 million only diluted shares outstanding in 2024, down from 98 million to 99 million shares previously. Regarding free cash flow, under our updated definition, we expect free cash flow of $385 million to $390 million. Our outlook for $385 million to $390 million includes cash paid for interest of $60 million and cash paid for nonrecurring restructuring and other items of $20 million as well as $25 million of cash received from certain strategic partners. Excluding interest in these nonrecurring items, we are raising our free cash flow outlook from $415 million to $420 million to $440 million to $445 million, up $25 million from our prior outlook. Our updated free cash flow guidance reflects the benefit we are seeing from better cash collections and lower commissions. We are also benefiting from a shift to annual upfront billings for some contact center customers. In summary, we had a strong start to the year and are raising our revenue and free cash flow outlook. Our leading differentiated products and unique go-to-market combined with our scale and laser focus on driving profitability and free cash flow position us well for creating long-term shareholder value. With that, let's open up the call for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) First question comes from Kash Rangan of Bank of America.', 'Kasthuri Gopalan Rangan', ""With Goldman Sachs. Vlad, question for you. It looks like enterprise ARR is growing faster than the overall company. It looks like that's an area of relative strength for the company as evidenced by the 40,000 UCaaS deals that you signed. Can you tell us what is driving the strength in the enterprise, be it product or competitiveness or execution standpoint? One, if I could slip in, certainly, you raised free cash flow guidance by a pretty meaningful amount. Can you tell us -- congratulations. Then can you tell us how sustainable is the free cash flow growth rate of the company going forward?"", 'Vladimir G. Shmunis', ""Okay. To the first question, look, we have a good product. It continues to be an industry-leading product. We continue innovating. As we mentioned, we have just and for the first time ever, won best of the show overall award at Enterprise Connect. That's a big deal, and we won specifically on the strength of our differentiated AI offering. With respect to both enterprise as a whole, but this one particular for instance -- this deal in particular, look, what are we known for? We're known for reliability, we're known for -- and this is bulletproof, knock on wood. It's multiple, multiple years of Five9 availability. And now I think with about 1.5 years of Six 9s. That has not been matched, I don't think in history. I can tell you, it does not come by accident. There was a lot of blood, sweat and tears that went into this over many, many years by many people, okay? [Eventually [we were left to] (inaudible) We are uniquely positioned to come -- to address complex use cases. As noted in the prepared remarks, we will chosen in this particular case, our reliability as well as use cases and some of the examples, ability to handle messages and just call times in general, call times what's happening during the call is a big deal for many enterprises.This one, in particular, is a meaningful retailer. They also have, as part of their retail establishment, the [Hall's Pharmacies]. So what's happening during on hold times its incredibly important, and we just have better ways of handling that. But I want to turn the mic over to Sonalee here in a sec, but I also want to give you the big picture. The big picture is why we're winning in enterprise, is again, good product, a robust, reliable, fully featured. But very importantly, a huge amount of greenfield still left. I really want people to internalize the fact that in spite of all of the rhetoric about, oh, video is taking over, messaging taking over, cloud taking over, which by the way we have all of those modalities as well. But voice continues to be the primary mission-critical medium of communications for people. And especially in our gold verticals, which includes retail, includes health care, includes financial, et cetera, we can easily see 100 million seats out there. Salesforce has just published a report saying that prevalent modes of [C2B] communications are voice and e-mail, and it is not [video messaging]. And this is where we shine. And largely by far not least, why we continue winning there and we have stabilized our growth in double digits still is focus. There was rhetoric as you know, relatively recently that RingCentral is abandoning enterprise. Well, this is our way of showing that is not quite. We're not abandoning enterprise, we're doubling down on enterprise. We absolutely see our right to win there. And I'll tell you what, as we have focused on enterprise and we'll continue focus, we will also be redoubling our efforts on SMB. It's been relatively underperforming in a very challenging macro for SMB, but we think that there is still a lot of juice left there. We also have a very strong position in the -- very strong and protectable right to win. So let's say, I'm cautiously optimistic that we'll be showing good results there as well moving forward. Sonalee?"", 'Sonalee Elizabeth Parekh', ""Thanks, Vlad. And thanks, Kash, for the call out on free cash flow. Yes, we are very, very proud of what we delivered. So as you know, last year, we took really important steps to transform the profile of our cost base, and we expanded operating margins by nearly 700 basis points year-over-year. And the efficiencies and productivity benefits realized are now reflecting in a big way, not only on operating margin, but we're seeing it in free cash flow, with -- if you look at where I've guided today, our unlevered adjusted free cash flow is expected to grow 34% this year. And free cash flow margins are expanding by about 370 basis points based on that updated guidance. So free cash flow margins are really starting to converge with operating margin. This is a trend that we sort of telegraphed because we're realizing the positive impact of the lower intensity of deferred commissions that we're amortizing over the last couple of years through the P&L. And we've also realized significant working capital efficiencies and shifting more of our long-term contractual commitments to upfront payments. So the power of the growing free cash flow, coupled with our focus on driving SBC down, which hopefully you know this as well, provides a real opportunity to drive significant free cash flow per share growth and driving that growth in excess of both revenue and overall free cash flow growth. So this year, we expect based on the midpoint of our guide on free cash flow, that our free cash flow per share will grow about 36%, and that outlook has improved by about 10 percentage points since we last reported last quarter. So given the improvements in our free cash flow and the updated outlook we've given you on share count, which we now expect to reduce year-over-year, we hope that you will judge us on the strong free cash flow per share growth that we will continue to deliver on a sustainable basis."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Samad Samana of Jefferies.', 'Samad Saleem Samana', ""Also honored to go after Kash. So I love the order of the Q&A. I hope you guys are doing well. Maybe first question, just Vlad, as I think about the largest deal, it's obviously small in the overall context of the millions of seats that RingCentral has. But when I think about -- that's got to be one of your larger individual deals. So could you help us maybe double-click into what the time line looked like in terms of winning the deal, what led it maybe in terms of like the features, so on and so forth? And what the expected roll out of a deal of this size looks like just given how big the deal is, and it's a signature win? And then certainly, just -- I'll squeeze in a stub question for you upfront as well, which is on the upfront billing, does that -- is there any discounting that's going on to drive the upfront collections? Or is that just the customers who are agreeing to that and the timing doesn't really matter to them?"", 'Vladimir G. Shmunis', ""Samad, okay. Yes. Glad to have you in your pole position here on the Q&A list. Okay. So as far as the deal, it wasn't one of the largest, it was the largest. So this is especially interesting, given, again, all of especially more recent rhetoric about our positioning in enterprise and Teams and all of them. Look, as far as how long, these types of deals are generally 1 to 2-year cycles. This particular one happened to be right in the middle, 18 months, okay? And it's -- I already mentioned some of the differentiated features. This customer is rotating out of Skype for Business. So it was a competitive RFP process. We don't always know who else is involved, but you can probably imagine the usual suspects. And as I already mentioned to Kash, it really has to do with reliability and features, okay?And again, we don't think that this is such an aberration [for these seat] deals, there are only so many of them out there to be had. But we do have other large installments. We have 20% of GTK which is -- which we count as part of our enterprise segment, so they're spending more $100,000 ARR with us. So we are very much active in large accounts. We continue this, but we believe that this -- we have a good chance to continue this being the case. And they really want to say this one more thing, again, this is getting all back into enterprise and Teams and how do we co-exist there. And we need to understand that there is Teams and then there is Teams Phone. We compete with Teams Phone. And as you can see, we have some success competing against Teams Phone. We work and partner with Teams itself, okay? So we are an integral part or extension to Teams via available APIs. We provide or support the single pane of glass and that's a major strength. We have really what we believe one of the best, if not the best Teams integrations on the market today. So I hope that answers the question."", 'Sonalee Elizabeth Parekh', ""Yes. And Samad, Sonalee here. On your question with respect to the accounting, no, there's nothing to call out there. It's really a mix shift. So as we grow in enterprise and the composition of enterprise's total increases in our overall revenue, it tilts us to more upfront billings and longer-term contracts. And that's obviously much more common in enterprise to bill upfront than say, SMB, which is often month-to-month. ."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Ryan MacWilliams of Barclays.', 'Ryan Patrick MacWilliams', 'Also continuing with the trend or the 2-part question, one for Vlad, one for Sonalee. For Vlad, just given the macro uncertainty, how does your pipeline look like for the rest of this year? And have you noticed any trends in the pipeline, whether between SMB and enterprise or UCaaS and CCaaS opportunities? And then for Sonalee, nice revenue result and free cash flow step up. But looks like the non-GAAP, where your operating margin guide was maintained. Could we just use this as a conservatism really to the start of the year? Or are you leaving room for more additional sales and marketing and R&D investments this year?', 'Vladimir G. Shmunis', ""Okay. Look, pipeline. So you see how we guided, we had a good quarter and what we believe is a strong guide as well. And so that should tell you that we feel relatively good and optimistic about the pipe. You asked between enterprise and SMB, they're very different because enterprise, again, is a year-plus cycle. SMB could be easily under 6 months in many cases, 1 to 3 months. So pipe there is a lot less -- it's not, not important, but it's just a very different dynamic there. But again, overall, we feel that we are finding bottom, if you will. And you have seen our enterprise rates stabilize over multiple quarters. You have not yet seen this from us in SMB, but we are optimistic that we're not far from that as well. And given the size of the greenfield opportunity, which is still -- we're still under 10 million seats ourselves, right? And we're is the lead by pure seat counts according to third-party research. Some of you may have caught our Wall Street Journal ad recently, which details are on the research. With the overall opportunity just in the enterprise, okay, being the $100 million, that's a long way to go. And given that we are still doubling and tripling down on innovation, we're infusing AI across the entire portfolio and not just limiting it to our new products, for example. Again, we are [100%] optimistic that we will continue holding our own and not to disappointing people. Okay. I think that was the question."", 'Sonalee Elizabeth Parekh', ""Yes. So on the margin question. So overall, we're really happy with the improvements we've driven in profitability over the last 2 years or so, margins have gone from 10% to, as you say, 21%, to where I've held the guide today. I think really, we feel we need to balance growth versus profitability and we need to maintain some flexibility to be able to go after attractive investments in either product innovation on the marketing side. We talked about the gold verticals, vertical-specific campaigns. Yes, we really see it as a balancing act. And on operating margin, I would say that I've guided closer to the pin. Hopefully, what you've seen is that we took up free cash flow margins from 17.5% to 18.5%. That's adjusted unlevered. So hopefully, that answers the question"", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho.', 'Sitikantha Panigrahi', 'I wanted to ask you about the new products that you expect to hit $100 million ARR by end of next year. Which one do you feel more excited about between the RingCX, RingSense and RingCentral Events? And also, how do you -- as you keep adding features to RingCX, how do you try to position your product versus your partnered product within their installed base?', 'Vladimir G. Shmunis', ""Yes, sure. Okay. Well, for those of you with multiple kids, it's like asking which daughter you like best. So there's no politically correct answer to that. We like them all or else probably we would not be investing in some of them. As far as -- they're very different. So we're talking about 3 products, one of which is really not the product but the family of products. So it's RingCX, which is our [CCaaS] Contact Center, it's RingCentral Events and its RingSense for Sales, but it's the first in a family of products for us because we expect to be introducing RingSense for other verticals and industry-specific solutions.I think it's easiest to quantify RingCX because the CCaaS market is relatively well covered and well understood. And this is getting to the second part of your question, RingCX differentiates on ease of use, pricing and packaging. And very importantly, it's an AI-native product. So AI is infused there from day 1. And of course, it seamlessly integrates with RingEX, which is our flagship UCaaS product. So we have internal projections, which we are not going to share at this point. But suffice to say that we feel confident that our goal of $100 million ARR across all 3 products is achievable, okay? We mentioned some numbers, we have approximately doubled or even more than doubled customer counts on both RingCX and RingCentral Events and that's just quarter-over-quarter. So, what was obviously a very strong growth, there is strong demand for the both of them. Events. I think -- what did we share, Sonalee? We said -- well, we can do it in, I think we got 25% quarter-over-quarter growth, which is still very, very strong. So again, it's very early for all of them, but very promising, okay? And I tell you what, I like having multiple forces in [the trades]. They all tell each other when we have an event sale, for example. It absolutely opens opportunities for us with CX, with RingSense and with EX itself, so it's a virtuous cycle."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Meta Marshall of Morgan Stanley.', 'James Eugene Faucette', 'This is Jamie on for Meta. I think maybe just following up on that last point, great to see the traction you guys are getting with RingCX. Are you able to provide any detail on how much of that base comes from existing customers versus new? And then just as a follow-up to that, have you seen any conflicts with the partnership that you guys have with NICE? Are you running into any challenges in terms of what to present to the customer? Or have you seen NICE try to take any of those customers direct?', 'Vladimir G. Shmunis', ""To your last question, look, it would not be in the spirit or for that matter, letter of the agreement for them to take them direct. So we hope not, okay? As far as base or not, when you say base, some of them are coming from our base, but not necessarily from the -- RCC, which is in [concert-base], NICE base. We're not trying to convert those to CX. Again, the 2 products are very different, in many ways complementary. RingCX is much simpler to use, install, very different price points, more aggressive price points. Of course, we have owner economics on it. So margins are healthy. But it's really just designed to address simpler use cases, more mass market, if you will, as opposed to the RingCentral Contact Center, RCC, which is flagship industry-leading Gartner and (inaudible) product that NICE had. So again, we have very clear rules of engagement, self-imposed internally. When we get an inquiry or a lead, we qualify which products to present it to or which products will be presented to the customer. And once we do, we will be -- we'll walk into that fast, okay? So it's rare to see a tug-of-war between EX [and CC first]."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer.', 'Timothy Kelly Horan', ""Two also, if I might. On RingCX, do you think you're expanding the number of agent seats out there or are companies adding contact center capabilities? Or is it kind of more of you taking market share from existing? And then secondly, on Microsoft Teams, do you have a sense of what percentage of Teams users now are using it for external phone calls and maybe a sense of where that can kind of go to? Do you maybe just have a rough sense of what percent Microsoft has versus other outsourcers like yourself?"", 'Vladimir G. Shmunis', ""No. I mean, Microsoft, they have their own numbers. Our use within Teams, I mean I think it's a well-known fact that people use Microsoft more for internal than external. Our gold vertical -- so let me answer it this way, our gold verticals all tend to be B2C, okay? So whenever you have a consumer needing to access their brands, okay, whether it be health care or financial or retail, these are just some of these, what we call, gold verticals. This is where we shine, okay? And this is very, very large market sale and huge amount between greenfield still left there. Sorry, what was the CX part of the question?"", 'Timothy Kelly Horan', ""Trying to understand, do you think the number of agents are growing in CX? Or are they shrinking? Your price point is pretty low and easy to use. Do you think you're enabling people to kind of go into this business for the first time if you're a small business, but maybe didn't have this capability before?"", 'Vladimir G. Shmunis', ""Absolutely. So if your question is, well, our count of agents is, of course, growing, very rapidly because we are early in that cycle, and we are just -- I think we have been doubling quarter-over-quarter, obviously, we're growing quite nicely. But if your question is about overall number of agents in the industry growing? That's a really interesting question. And obviously, there is this line of thinking that AI will replace agents. For now, we are seeing more AI augmenting agents. I do believe that over time, overall number of humans in the industry will stabilize and be decreasing. I also subscribe to that. And for that reason, we're building AI and agent assist copilot and even agent-replace capabilities into CX. So this is absolutely taking place. It will always be the case and already is the case that the bot is much cheaper than a human being. It's not as good yet, not a versatile, and this is across the industry or else there wouldn't be any agents left. You made an interesting point about small businesses, they didn't have access to this type of functionality before. That's -- I would agree to that, that [largely -- likely] true. I can tell you from my personal interactions with small and medium type businesses, many of them actually pride themselves on the fact that they provide human assistance and not -- if you hide behind bots, and this is their way of differentiating and kind of showing the human touch and human TLC. I do expect that to stay for the foreseeable future as well. So there are different dynamics here. As a business and at the high level, how we approach it is saying, look, the customer. If you want to have a good, solid cost effective solution of empowering and lighting up your human agents, here is the solution. As you are ready, here is a simple and relatively seamless path of augmenting their experience, your agents' experience and the customers' experience. And as you get more comfortable, if you feel that you can start reducing the number of agents, that's just fine as well because here is this technology, which will allow you to do that without leaving the platform. Okay? So it's more of an evolution than the revolution as well we see and we're [tractioning] that road map."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Brian Peterson of Raymond James.', 'Brian Christopher Peterson', ""Congrats on the quarter. So Vlad, the tone in GSP was notably strong this quarter. I'm curious, is that a broad-based comment? Or are there a couple that are really driving that strength? And how are you thinking about that growth profile through that channel over the next couple of years?"", 'Vladimir G. Shmunis', ""With GSP. So yes, thank you for asking that. Look, (inaudible) and actually, I'm surprised that not more people asked this question and concentrate on this. Because this is one area where we really have built a practice that is unrivaled in the industry. If you think about historical terms, a few years ago, BroadSoft, which was an on-prem provider, really had licensed something like 700 carriers worldwide, which is really almost all of them. And they provided them with software licensees. In many cases, they were perpetual licenses, okay, which carriers have just bought in bulk. And it sounded wonderful and the company has a nice exit and Cisco now owns them. The thing here, this platform has not been innovated on in a number of years now. It is still on-prem. There is not a natural path to the cloud and telcos are -- and when I say telcos, it's not just telcos. It's telcos and cable providers as well, okay, for example, Charter Communications is a very valued member of our GSP partners. And they're doing extremely well, okay, with our product. So they are just increasingly realizing that they have to move on this day and age really almost unsupported software that's out there with BroadSoft, which has seen it prime, and there are mass migrations underway. So we are very bullish about the channel. We are seeing both growth from, call it, same-store sales where each and every individual GSP is growing nicely as well as we are adding new major logos. We just announced Optus, Australia's second largest, I believe, owned by Singtel. So you can imagine that -- there are conversations across the board there. And look, BroadSoft, we have a number of very good people from what used to be BroadSoft. We know the playbook. We know who the accounts are. We also are well aware of the fact that out of the 700 that they have, we have approximately 2% of those. So low runway there. And we will be -- we expect to be sharing more in this later in the year and perhaps at our Analyst Day. But it is definitely an area of strength and a very nice competitive model for us"", 'Operator', 'And our last question comes from Terry Tillman of Truist.', 'Robert William Dee', ""Great. This is Bobby Dee on for Terry. I'm curious with the RingEX rebrand. I'm curious how the go-to-market organization has reacted and evolved with the change. Are there potentially some productivity gains on the table for more of a multiproduct platform selling approach?"", 'Vladimir G. Shmunis', ""Yes. I think people understand the reason for this. I think general reception has been quite positive. They understand that by remaining from MVP, which was message video phone, to RingEX. It does not mean that we're bundling the multimodal strategy. It just means that we are redoubling on the experience part of it. It's more about any modality, in particular, but more about integration of all modalities together. But even more importantly than that, is infusion of AI and semantic capabilities across the entire portfolio and across all modalities. And this is what people are excited about. This is what won us as Best of Show at Enterprise Connect. And look, we're in beta, we're in close beta here, but expect that we will be showing and showcasing these capabilities even to this group, our coverage universe in the relatively near future. I can tell you that we are using these products internally and it's a game changer. It's just amazing what you can do with AI if you apply it to a large network, just what kind of results can be achieved."", 'Operator', 'And this concludes our conference call.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price."", 'The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 15. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This seller of routers, switches, software and services is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.83 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -17%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $12.47 billion, down 14.4% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.96% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.', 'Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.', 'Earnings Whisper', ""Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction)."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cisco?', ""For Cisco, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.58%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.', 'So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Cisco will beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Cisco would post earnings of $0.84 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.87, delivering a surprise of +3.57%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported."", ""Cisco doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release."", 'Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
