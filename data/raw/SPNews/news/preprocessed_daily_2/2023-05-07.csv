The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. This means that investors who purchase Charles Schwab's shares on or after the 11th of May will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 26th of May.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.25 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$1.00 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Charles Schwab stock has a trailing yield of around 2.0% on the current share price of $49.24. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Charles Schwab's dividend is reliable and sustainable. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. View our latest analysis for Charles Schwab Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Charles Schwab is paying out just 24% of its profit after tax, which is comfortably low and leaves plenty of breathing room in the case of adverse events.Companies that pay out less in dividends than they earn in profits generally have more sustainable dividends. The lower the payout ratio, the more wiggle room the business has before it could be forced to cut the dividend.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. For this reason, we're glad to see Charles Schwab's earnings per share have risen 18% per annum over the last five years.Story continuesThe main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Charles Schwab has lifted its dividend by approximately 15% a year on average. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see.The Bottom LineIs Charles Schwab worth buying for its dividend? Companies like Charles Schwab that are growing rapidly and paying out a low fraction of earnings, are usually reinvesting heavily in their business. This is one of the most attractive investment combinations under this analysis, as it can create substantial value for investors over the long run. Overall, Charles Schwab looks like a promising dividend stock in this analysis, and we think it would be worth investigating further.In light of that, while Charles Schwab has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock.

Each of these non-GAAP financial measures is either adjusted from GAAP results to exclude certain expenses or derived from multiple GAAP measures, which are outlined in the “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” tables, attached, and the “Additional Selected Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations” tables, attached.In managing Qorvo's business on a consolidated basis, management develops an annual operating plan, which is approved by our Board of Directors, using non-GAAP financial measures. In developing and monitoring performance against this plan, management considers the actual or potential impacts on these non-GAAP financial measures from actions taken to reduce costs with the goal of increasing gross margin and operating margin. In addition, management relies upon these non-GAAP financial measures to assess whether research and development efforts are at an appropriate level, and when making decisions about product spending, administrative budgets, and other operating expenses. Also, we believe that non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors and enable investors to analyze the results of operations in the same way as management. We have chosen to provide this supplemental information to enable investors to perform additional comparisons of our operating results, to assess our liquidity and capital position and to analyze financial performance excluding the effect of expenses unrelated to operations, certain non-cash expenses and stock-based compensation expense, which may obscure trends in Qorvo's underlying performance.We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures offer an additional view of Qorvo's operations that, when coupled with the GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of Qorvo's results of operations and the factors and trends affecting Qorvo's business. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.Our rationale for using these non-GAAP financial measures, as well as their impact on the presentation of Qorvo's operations, are outlined below:Non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin.  Non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin exclude amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring related charges and certain non-cash expenses. We believe that exclusion of these costs in presenting non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin facilitates a useful evaluation of our historical performance and projected costs and the potential for realizing cost efficiencies.We view amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s research and development efforts, trade names, and customer relationships, as items arising from pre-acquisition activities, determined at the time of an acquisition, rather than ongoing costs of operating Qorvo’s business. While these intangible assets are continually evaluated for impairment, amortization of the cost of purchased intangible assets is a static expense, which is not typically affected by operations during any particular period. Although we exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets from these non-GAAP financial measures, management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase price accounting and contribute to revenue generation.We believe that presentation of non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin and other non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of stock-based compensation expense assists management and investors in evaluating the period-over-period performance of Qorvo's ongoing operations because (i) the expenses are non-cash in nature, and (ii) although the size of the grants is within our control, the amount of expense varies depending on factors such as short-term fluctuations in stock price volatility and prevailing interest rates, which can be unrelated to the operational performance of Qorvo during the period in which the expense is incurred and generally are outside the control of management. Moreover, we believe that the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense in presenting non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin and other non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors to understand the impact of the expensing of stock-based compensation to Qorvo's gross profit and gross margins and other financial measures in comparison to prior periods. We also believe that the adjustments to profit and margin related to restructuring related charges and certain non-cash expenses do not constitute part of Qorvo's ongoing operations and therefore the exclusion of these items provides management and investors with better visibility into the actual revenue and actual costs required to generate revenues over time and facilitates a useful evaluation of our historical and projected performance. We believe disclosure of non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin has economic substance because the excluded expenses do not represent continuing cash expenditures and, as described above, we have little control over the timing and amount of the expenses in question.For the three months ended April 1, 2023, non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin also exclude charges associated with a long-term capacity reservation agreement. We elected to apply the remaining pre-paid refundable deposit against portions of monthly purchase commitments for the term of the amended agreement in lieu of ordering certain additional silicon wafers. This election was made to better align component inventory with the timing of the forecasted finished goods demand. This resulted in an impairment to the prepaid refundable deposit recorded in our cost of goods sold. We believe these non-cash charges are not reflective of the performance of our ongoing business.Non-GAAP operating income and operating margin. Non-GAAP operating income and operating margin exclude stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, acquisition and integration related costs, gain or loss on assets, asset impairments, start-up costs, restructuring related charges, charges associated with a long-term capacity reservation agreement and certain non-cash expenses. We believe that presentation of a measure of operating income and operating margin that excludes amortization of intangible assets and stock-based compensation expense is useful to both management and investors for the same reasons as described above with respect to our use of non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin. We believe that acquisition and integration related costs, gain or loss on assets, asset impairments, start-up costs, restructuring related charges, charges associated with a long-term capacity reservation agreement and certain non-cash expenses do not constitute part of Qorvo's ongoing operations and therefore, the exclusion of these costs provides management and investors with better visibility into the actual costs required to generate revenues over time and facilitates a useful evaluation of our historical and projected performance. We believe disclosure of non-GAAP operating income and operating margin has economic substance because the excluded expenses are either unrelated to ongoing operations or do not represent current cash expenditures.Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share exclude the effects of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, acquisition and integration related costs, gain or loss on assets, asset impairments, start-up costs, restructuring related charges, charges associated with a long-term capacity reservation agreement and certain non-cash expenses, gain or loss on investments, other expense (income) and also reflect an adjustment of income taxes. The income tax adjustment primarily represents the use of research and development tax credit carryforwards, deferred tax expense (benefit) items not affecting taxes payable, adjustments related to the deemed and actual repatriation of historical foreign earnings, non-cash expense (benefit) related to uncertain tax positions and other items unrelated to the current fiscal year or that are not indicative of our ongoing business operations. We believe that presentation of measures of net income and net income per diluted share that exclude these items is useful to both management and investors for the reasons described above with respect to non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin and non-GAAP operating income and operating margin. We believe disclosure of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share has economic substance because the excluded expenses are either unrelated to ongoing operations or do not represent current cash expenditures.Non-GAAP operating expenses (research and development and selling, general and administrative). Non-GAAP research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses exclude stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets and certain non-cash expenses (primarily acquisition and integration related costs). We believe that presentation of measures of these operating expenses that exclude amortization of intangible assets and stock-based compensation expense is useful to both management and investors for the same reasons as described above with respect to our use of non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin. We believe that acquisition and integration related costs and certain non-cash expenses do not constitute part of Qorvo's ongoing operations and therefore, the exclusion of these costs provides management and investors with better visibility into the actual costs required to generate revenues over time and facilitates a useful evaluation of our historical and projected performance. We believe disclosure of these non-GAAP operating expenses has economic substance because the excluded expenses are either unrelated to ongoing operations or do not represent current cash expenditures.Free cash flow. Qorvo defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities during the period minus property and equipment expenditures made during the period, and free cash flow margin is calculated as free cash flow as a percentage of revenue. We use free cash flow as a supplemental financial measure in our evaluation of liquidity and financial strength. Management believes that this measure is useful as an indicator of our ability to service our debt, meet other payment obligations and make strategic investments. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Additionally, our definition of free cash flow is limited, in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our entire statement of cash flows.EBITDA. Qorvo adjusts GAAP net income for interest expense, interest income, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and intangible amortization expense, stock-based compensation and other charges that are not representative of Qorvo's ongoing operations (including asset impairments, investment activity, acquisition-related costs, restructuring-related costs and certain charges associated with a long-term capacity reservation agreement) when presenting EBITDA. Management believes that this measure is useful to evaluate our ongoing operations and as a general indicator of our operating cash flow (in conjunction with a cash flow statement which also includes among other items, changes in working capital and the effect of non-cash charges).Non-GAAP ROIC. Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a non-GAAP financial measure that management believes provides useful supplemental information for management and the investor by measuring the effectiveness of our operations' use of invested capital to generate profits. We use ROIC to track how much value we are creating for our shareholders. Non-GAAP ROIC is calculated by dividing annualized non-GAAP operating income, net of an adjustment for income taxes (as described above), by average invested capital. Average invested capital is calculated by subtracting the average of the beginning balance and the ending balance of equity plus net debt, less certain goodwill.Net debt or positive net cash. Net debt or positive net cash is defined as unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments minus any borrowings under our credit facility and the principal balance of our senior unsecured notes. Management believes that net debt or positive net cash provides useful information regarding the level of Qorvo's indebtedness by reflecting cash and investments that could be used to repay debt.Inventory days on hand. Inventory days on hand is defined as (a) average net inventory for the period, divided by (b) the result of non-GAAP cost of goods sold for the period divided by the number of days in the period.Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures.  Our earnings release contains forward-looking free cash flow, gross margin, income tax rate and diluted earnings per share. We provide these non-GAAP measures to investors on a prospective basis for the same reasons (set forth above) that we provide them to investors on a historical basis. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures without unreasonable effort due to variability and difficulty in making accurate projections for items that would be required to be included in the GAAP measures, such as stock-based compensation, acquisition and integration related costs, restructuring related charges, gain or loss on assets, asset impairments, gain or loss on investments and the provision for income taxes, which could have a potentially significant impact on our future GAAP results.Limitations of non-GAAP financial measures. The primary material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool compared to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are these non-GAAP financial measures (i) may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in our industry, and (ii) exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance, thus limiting their usefulness as a comparative tool. We compensate for these limitations by providing full disclosure of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the corresponding GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, to enable investors to perform their own analysis of our gross profit and gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, net income per diluted share and net cash provided by operating activities. We further compensate for the limitations of our use of non-GAAP financial measures by presenting the corresponding GAAP measures more prominently.Qorvo will conduct a conference call at 5:00 p.m. ET today to discuss today’s press release.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read Top 5 High Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Analysts. Dividend stocks have been on investors’ radars for quite some time now because of their ability to generate stable and regular income, lower risk, and tax advantages. Companies in the US also registered investors’ inclination toward dividend equities and steadily boosted their payouts over the years. According to a report by McKinsey &amp; Company, US companies returned 78% of their net income on average in dividends and share repurchases between 1995 and 2021, up from 60% on average between 1965 to 2008. This has boosted investors’ confidence, who are increasingly loading up on dividend stocks, especially during periods of market downturns.High inflationary periods have previously been beneficial for dividend equities because they have the potential to offer higher yields. This is more appealing for investors seeking income that can keep up with inflation. In our article titled 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we reported that dividends accounted for 54% of the market’s returns during decades of high inflation. The report also mentioned that during the 1940s, 1960s, and 1970s, dividends represented 67%, 44%, and 73% of the market’s returns, respectively. During these decades, inflation averaged above 5% with total returns averaging below 10%.When investing in dividend stocks, investors also pay attention to dividend yields as they indicate the amount of income an investor can expect to receive from a dividend-paying stock concerning its price. High dividend-yielding stocks are often considered risky investments because they signal financial distress or underlying problems within a company. However, overall financial health and a solid balance sheet of the respective company can mitigate the risks associated with high yields. Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO), Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), and British American Tobacco p.l.c. (NYSE:BTI) have above-average dividend yields but also have strong dividend histories. For safe investment purposes, investors should focus on dividend growth streaks along with dividend yields.Story continuesThe S&amp;P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats, which tracks the performance of companies with over 20 years of consistent dividend growth and has an average dividend yield of 3.5%, delivered a total return of 590.3% from December 1999 to June 2019, compared with a 215.2% return of the S&amp;P Composite 1500, Insider Monkey reported.Top 20 High Dividend Stocks To Buy According To AnalystsPhoto by Ruben Sukatendel on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we used the Finviz stock screener to identify dividend stocks with yields above 6%, as of May 4.

(NYSE:CWH), down from 22 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a collective value of over $171.8 million. With over 5 million shares, Abrams Capital Management was the company's leading stakeholder in Q4.19. Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)Upside Potential as of May 4: 21.3% Average Price Target Based on Analyst Ratings: $114.3 Dividend Yield as of May 4: 5.39%Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is an American multinational tobacco company that sells its products around the world. The company currently offers a quarterly dividend of $1.27 per share for a dividend yield of 5.39%, as of May 5. It is one of the best dividend stocks on our list as it has raised its dividends consistently for the past 14 years.Stifel initiated its coverage on Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) in April with a Buy rating and a $114 price target, calling the company one of the top ideas in the space. The firm also believes that the company offers superior growth potential.As of the close of Q4 2022, 47 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database owned stakes in Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), worth over $6.2 billion collectively.Artisan Partners mentioned Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Our top individual contributors were Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), EOG Resources and Merck. Despite being US-based, tobacco company PM derives all its sales from outside the US. As a result, foreign exchange impacts can be an important driver of near-term returns, and the recent weakening in the US dollar should provide a strong tailwind for earnings due to translation effects. However, our investment case is not tied to currency movements. By virtue of its globally known brands, PM is the best-in-class operator with a well-diversified business, particularly by geography. We believe its next generation heat-not-burn product IQOS should gain share as consumers continue migrating to safer tobacco delivery systems. The company is progressing toward its acquisition of Swedish Match, a Swedish tobacco and nicotine products maker, which was previously held in the portfolio. The deal is a good fit for PM as it reduces PM’s dependence on cigarettes—a category in steady decline—and accelerates the company’s transition to smokeless “reduced-risk” products (RRPs)—a category that has experienced rapid growth over the past five years. PM can also leverage its global scale to generate significant revenue synergies from these complementary product sets, as well as quickly gain access to the US market—the world’s largest market for RRPs and one where regulators have embraced RRPs and other less harmful nicotine products. Looking at PM through our margin-of-safety criteria, the business trades for an undemanding valuation and has extraordinary business economics and a strong credit profile.”18. Coterra Energy Inc.

Here is what the firm has to say:“U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) shares are ensnared in the bank-run panic that began late in the quarter. Two large banks failed in early March as depositors rushed to withdraw money on concerns that the banks would suffer from liquidity problems. That’s a self-fulfilling prophecy, of course, but in the case of the two banks, it was prompted by the revelations of utter mismanagement of their securities portfolio. Bank models are, essentially, to borrow short and lend long. This sounds dangerous of course, and it would be if not for the deposit guarantee provided by the FDIC. The history of the U.S. banking system can be divided into two eras – pre-FDIC, when bank runs were fairly common, and post-FDIC, when bank runs have been close to non-existent. However, FDIC protection has its limits, and it remains incumbent on management to properly manage its assets and liabilities. The two banks in question didn’t do that. By taking down the share prices of all banks, we think investors are shooting first and asking questions later; they are not distinguishing between the strong and the weak.U.S. Bancorp, as one of the largest and best-managed banks in the country, appears to be a net beneficiary so far of the panic among some depositors, with a pick-up in net deposit inflows in recent weeks. We don’t dismiss the probability of industry contagion – in a true nationwide panic, the big banks will suffer along with the small banks, and the well-managed ones will suffer along with the badly-managed ones. But we think the odds of that are quite small, and recent steps by federal regulators confirm that they will do everything in their power to prevent such a scenario, given the calamitous impact that it would have on our economy. We tightly manage this risk by limiting our exposure to the banking sector.”6. Telephone and Data Systems, Inc.

This payment means that the dividend yield will be 2.3%, which is around the industry average. Check out our latest analysis for CF Industries Holdings CF Industries Holdings' Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWe like to see a healthy dividend yield, but that is only helpful to us if the payment can continue. However, prior to this announcement, CF Industries Holdings' dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.EPS is set to fall by 51.4% over the next 12 months. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio could be 22%, which we consider to be quite comfortable, with most of the company's earnings left over to grow the business in the future.historic-dividendCF Industries Holdings Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.32 total annually to $1.60. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 17% per annum over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. CF Industries Holdings has impressed us by growing EPS at 52% per year over the past five years. Earnings have been growing rapidly, and with a low payout ratio we think that the company could turn out to be a great dividend stock.We Really Like CF Industries Holdings' DividendOverall, we think that this is a great income investment, and we think that maintaining the dividend this year may have been a conservative choice. The company is generating plenty of cash, and the earnings also quite easily cover the distributions. If earnings do fall over the next 12 months, the dividend could be buffeted a little bit, but we don't think it should cause too much of a problem in the long term. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

For a deeper dive into how we make our Pro Picks, read more here.Vertex Pharma roars aheadVertex Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:VRTX), which develops treatments for cystic fibrosis, has been very good to investors: Its return on common equity comes in at around 25%, and InvestingPro’s fair value estimate predicts it has nearly 20% more upside from here. Its eye-popping 3.76 InvestingPro financial health score is thanks to the company firing on all cylinders: Its profitability, earnings growth, and cash flow are all blazing, and shares have strong price momentum as well. And with the company’s spectacular 50% margin on EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), Vertex investors should sleep well at night. Shares are up some 22% for the year to $348.09.Gilead could be a buy on the dipBiotech behemoth Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) has rock-solid profitability that props up its excellent 3.06 InvestingPro financial health score, and it has also delivered a wonderful 27% return on common equity for investors.

(NYSE:WMT) has announced that it will be paying its dividend of $0.57 on the 5th of September, an increased payment from last year's comparable dividend. The payment will take the dividend yield to 1.5%, which is in line with the average for the industry. View our latest analysis for Walmart Walmart's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWe aren't too impressed by dividend yields unless they can be sustained over time. The last dividend was quite easily covered by Walmart's earnings. This means that a large portion of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 68.0%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 32% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendWalmart Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $1.88 total annually to $2.28. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 1.9% per annum over that time. While the consistency in the dividend payments is impressive, we think the relatively slow rate of growth is less attractive.Walmart Could Grow Its DividendSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. We are encouraged to see that Walmart has grown earnings per share at 5.6% per year over the past five years. Shareholders are getting plenty of the earnings returned to them, which combined with strong growth makes this quite appealing.Walmart Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Walmart is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one.

9,4b77f705-acd4-3037-ae04-619863b04a7f,JWN,2023-05-07,San Francisco’s ruin is a warning to ultra-Left officials everywhere,The Telegraph,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/san-francisco-ruin-warning-ultra-110000287.html,1683457200,STORY,['JWN'],"[Vacant shops are becoming a more common sight in San Francisco - Jason Henry/BloombergIts tech industries are still booming. It is the financial hub for the whole of California, with the state now the fifth largest economy in the world. And it is home to some of the world’s biggest companies.Add it all up, and San Francisco should be one of the best retail centres globally; an easy place to sell every kind of luxury good, fashion essentials and high end electronics. The money is there, as well as the people to spend it.Yet this week, the department store Nordstrom announced it was shutting its locations in the city, joining a growing exodus of big name retailers. Household brands are in despair over the damage inflicted by an ultra-woke local government.There is a warning here for many British cities, not least as left-wing parties consolidate their dominance following another set of disastrous local elections for the Conservative Party. Push businesses too hard, let crime run out of control, and eventually they will simply up and leave. It is happening in ultra-wealthy California, and very soon it could be happening in London, Bristol or Cardiff.Nordstrom’s announcement was yet another blow for San Francisco’s battered retail industry. The company told employees it would not be renewing its leases at the Westfield Mall, nor at the Nordstrom Rack across the street, due to the “changed dynamics” in the city.The “deteriorating situation in downtown San Francisco,” Westfield Mall told the Washington Post, has left both customers and staff unsafe.The retailer is hardly the first to put up the “closing down sale” signs. The upmarket grocery chain Whole Foods has shuttered a flagship store; the H&amp;M, Gap and Banana Republic have all left. While some British high streets risk becoming boarded-up wastelands, they could soon look positively vibrant compared to what used to be known as “the golden city”.There is no great mystery here. Under its ultra-woke Mayor, London Breed, San Francisco has been testing out a wide array of faddish, progressive policies. In the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests, Breed was one of the first to jump on the “defund the police” bandwagon, cutting $120 million from the law and order budget.Story continuesSales and corporate taxes have been pushed up. Homelessness has been tolerated right across the city centre. Motorists reportedly leave car windows and doors unlocked to deter overnight break-ins.Last summer, a groups of business officials wrote to officials threatening to stop paying taxes if politicians failed to clear litter from the streets and stop people from openly taking drugs. And the city was shocked by the death of tech entrepreneur Bob Lee last month. The revered executive was stabbed in a neighbourhood not far from Google and Instagram’s city offices.Bob Lee was fatally stabbed near Google's San Francisco city office - AP Photo/Jeff ChiuThe quality of life has deteriorated steadily in San Francisco, not least for those who cannot afford to escape to the wealthier suburbs. Businesses are shunning the city, perhaps deterred by an increasingly unfavourable local tax, social and regulatory environment.In 2021, foreign direct investment into new projects in San Francisco fell to their lowest level since 2009. And as shops close, real estate prices are tumbling. Let’s not forget that one of the big reasons the San Francisco based First Republic Bank had to be rescued was because of expected losses on property loans. The city is slipping into a vicious cycle of decline from which it is hard to see any exit.San Francisco’s problems might seem a long way away, but they could soon be mirrored here in the UK. We have no shortage of ultra-woke local councils, and devolved administrations, which are more interested in left-wing virtue signalling than providing decent services, keeping taxes down, or making sure the streets are safe and the rubbish collected.In London, the mayor Sadiq Khan has launched a war on motorists with his Ulez charges, ignoring the fact that tradesmen need vans. The transport system is suffering catastrophic losses, in large part because of Khan’s economically damaging, if politically expedient, decision to freeze TfL fares in 2017. Violent crime is increasing. Climate protesters appear to have free rein to harass companies that are operating legally, and individuals as they go about their day-to-day business.In Bristol, graffiti is almost everywhere you look. In Brighton, the rubbish remains uncollected for weeks at a time, while popular shopping areas have been closed to everyone apart from cyclists.In Wales, the devolved administration has been bombarding retailers with demands for politically-correct measures, such as proposed ban on meal deals, which apparently are not healthy enough, even though to many students or people on low incomes they might be the only way of staying fed during a cost of living crisis.Meanwhile, up in the SNP’s Scotland, companies have faced a blizzard of legislation, such as an absurdly complex charge for returning bottles, that along with higher and higher taxes, are steadily putting many of them out of business. The list goes on and on, and as Labour and Liberal Democrat councillors take power in more councils – and let’s keep in mind here that the Lib Dem are often far more woke than even their Labour rivals – it is only going to get worse and worse.There is a lesson in the closure of Nordstrom in San Francisco. It is one of the wealthiest places in the world. It has a per capita income of $160,000 (£126,000), according to figures from the Federal Reserve. That is way above anywhere in the UK, even for the ritzier parts of London and the Home Counties.It is often complacently assumed that businesses will just take any amount of punishment so long as there are still customers with money to spend. You can push taxes up to any level you like, let crime run out of control, turn the streets over to vagrants, and impose as many virtue-signalling rules and regulations as you can think of, and they will stoically put up with it all because they need the market. San Francisco is a warning that that is simply not true.There is always a final straw. That was true of Nordstrom and the golden city. And very soon it may be true of many cities in the UK as well. Ultra left local governments can destroy even successful cities – and once it starts it is almost impossible to reverse.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

Given the exceptionally strong businesses that the companies chosen for this column have, the lucrative sectors in which they operate and their lack of vulnerability to competition, you can hold these names until you retire. What’s more, they probably won’t cost you any sleep at night. In fact, here are those seven best forever stocks to buy and hold in 2023.GMGeneral Motors$33.08NOWServiceNow$443.68ONON Semiconductor$79.17AMZNAmazon.com$103.63MGMMGM.$45.95MCDMcDonald’s$298.07JPMJPMorgan$138.92General Motors (GM)An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""Source: PX Media / ShutterstockOn April 26, I identified General Motors (NYSE:GM) as one of several “growth stocks with huge return potential for long-term investors.” As reasons for my bullishness, I cited the automaker’s “beat-and-raise” first-quarter results, and its ability to benefit from strong travel trends in its two major markets, the U.S. and China. In the past, I’ve also been upbeat about the company’s upcoming electric vehicles and its autonomous vehicles subsidiary, Cruise.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMaking me more bullish on the long-term outlook of GM stock, one of the  most well-respected auto-stock analysts, Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas, upgraded the shares to “overweight” from “equal weight.” The analyst wrote that the automaker’s gasoline-powered vehicles had surpassed his expectations, while GM has reduced its spending. Jonas believes that the company’s EV strategy is prudent, as the company is giving itself the opportunity to either accelerate or decelerate its transition to Evs. He set a price target of $38 on the name.ServiceNow (NOW)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is one of the great forever growth stocks to own because it does not have a great deal of competition. It’s growing rapidly. It’s profitable. It saves its customers a great deal of money, and, not surprisingly, NOW’s customers are very loyal to it.Story continuesThose characteristics helped the company report extremely strong first-quarter results on April 26. NOW’s top line soared 22% year-over-year to $2.1 billion, while its backlog climbed 25% YOY, excluding currency changes. On the bottom line, its net income jumped 100% to $150 million. Finally, NOW hiked its fiscal 2023 subscription sales outlook to $8.47 billion to $8.52 billion versus its previous guidance of $8.44 billion to $8,5 billion.Also noteworthy is that 85% of the company’s net new backlog is derived from its current customers.Deutsche Bank responded to the results by raising its price target on NOW stock to $545 from $525. The bank is upbeat on the tech firm’s “execution” and believes that NOW “is being prioritized by customers in a volatile macro environment,” The Fly reported.ON Semiconductor (ON)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON) is another name I’m bullish on. In my April 4 column on “stocks to buy for the massive rally ahead,” I expressed bullishness about ON due to its high leverage to the quickly growing automotive and industrial chip markets.ON’s first-quarter results demonstrated that the chip maker is indeed a big beneficiary of the large increases in the number of semiconductors being utilized by automakers and industrial companies.Specifically, its automotive revenue jumped a huge 38% year-over-year last quarter, enabling its top line to come in $30 million above analysts’ average estimate. The company’s industrial sales increased 1% in Q1 versus Q4, even though Q4 is much seasonally stronger than Q1.Amazon.com (AMZN)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Many investors are concerned that Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) cloud unit revenue climbed just 11% year-over-year last month and increased only 16% year-over-year in its fiscal Q1. However, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy noted that AWS is intensively utilizing AI, and is incorporating technology from a number of top AI startups in its cloud offerings. As a result, I’m bullish on the longer-term outlook of AWS.Making me even more upbeat on Amazon’s longer-term potential, Morgan Stanley thinks that AWS can benefit from exploiting the “largely untapped” public clouds market. The bank estimates the total value of this sector at an incredible $2.5 trillion.On the e-commerce front, Amazon should benefit in the medium-to-long term from the normalization of consumers’ goods-to-experiences spending ratio. Moreover, its dominance in e-commerce throughout much of the Western world is unlikely to be challenged in the foreseeable future.Also encouragingly, Jassy reported that the company’s prescription drug business, Amazon Pharmacy launched in 2020, is “off to a good start” and “continuing to grow.” Staying with the healthcare space, I agree with Jassy’s assessment that the company can use the network of clinics that it acquired, together with Amazon Clinic, to build a sizeable, needle-moving healthcare business.MGM (MGM)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comIn line with my previous predictions, MGM (NYSE:MGM) is clearly clicking on all cylinders as both Las Vegas and Macau casinos make big comebacks.MGM reported standout first-quarter results, as its top line soared 36% versus the same period a year earlier to $3.87 billion, $280 million above analysts’ average estimate. The casino operator’s property EBITDAR, excluding certain items, climbed 41% year-over-year to a record $1.1 billion.Conventions are returning to Las Vegas, and the city and MGM will benefit from many other positive catalysts, including the popular  Formula One auto race later this year, the city’s relatively new NFL team, and, potentially, a Major League Baseball team down the road.MGM’s gross gaming revenue from Macau came in at 78% of the levels of Q1 2019, and its revenue from the region should climb meaningfully as China’s travel boom continues. MGM’s online betting joint venture, BetMGM reported that its revenue jumped 76% year-over-year last quarter, while its overall market share was a significant 17%. MGM expects BetMGM to become profitable by the end of this year. As more parts of the U.S. allow online betting and BetMGM’s brand strengthens, the joint venture’s profit should jump tremendously.McDonald’s (MCD)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comMcDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) is clearly a very popular institution, and that status is unlikely to change in the years ahead. Moreover, due to its relatively cheap offerings, MCD stock will not drop drastically during economic downturns.Its tremendous popularity is reflected by many data points, including the fact that its traffic rose in all of its operating regions last quarter, despite the significant price increases that it implemented, while its global same-store sales jumped 12.6% year-over-year. As a result of those price hikes and traffic gains., MCD expects to generate a healthy operating margin of roughly 45% this year.In the wake of McDonald’s Q1 results, BMO Capital raised its price target on the stock to $325 from $300 as the bank believes that the restaurant chain’s “strong momentum” and market share increases should continue going forward. BMO kept an “outperform” rating on the shares.JPMorgan (JPM)image of businessperson and bar graph with dollar signs to represent undervalued stocksSource: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.comAfter acquiring First Republic’s attractive assets in a “sweetheart” deal, JPMorgan has become very attractive to conservative, long-term investors.According to my estimates, the transaction will give JPM $62 billion of net new deposits ($92 billion of deposits less $25 billion that JPM will refund to other large banks that put money in FRC in March and $5 billion that JPM placed in First Republic).  The deal is expected to raise the bank’s bottom line by an estimated $500 million annually. All while it paid $10.6 billion for “$18B in net assets ”The deal will also add a meaningful number of new, very rich wealth management clients to JPM’s roster and many other high net worth clients. Moreover, the FDIC has agreed to ” cover 80% of credit losses over the next seven years for the residential mortgages  [of First Republic’s assets acquired by JPM]and the next five years for the commercial loan portfolio.”JPM’s EPS is now expected to climb to $14.87 in 2025, up from $12.09 last year. Given the fact that JPM has said its estimates of its profits from the First Republic deal are conservative and I believe that many analysts are underestimating the strength of the U.S. economy, I wouldn’t be surprised if its EPS comes in at around $17 in 2025.If my estimate proves correct, the shares are trading for eight times its 2025 EPS, which is an attractive valuation.As of the date of publication, Larry Ramer owned shares of MGM.

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Microchip Technology's (NASDAQ:MCHP) returns on capital, so let's have a look.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Microchip Technology:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.24 = US$3.1b ÷ (US$16b - US$3.1b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).So, Microchip Technology has an ROCE of 24%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Semiconductor industry average of 14%. Check out our latest analysis for Microchip Technology roceIn the above chart we have measured Microchip Technology's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsThe trends we've noticed at Microchip Technology are quite reassuring. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 24%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 112%. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at Microchip Technology thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.The Bottom LineA company that is growing its returns on capital and can consistently reinvest in itself is a highly sought after trait, and that's what Microchip Technology has. Since the stock has returned a solid 74% to shareholders over the last five years, it's fair to say investors are beginning to recognize these changes. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Microchip Technology can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.Story continuesOne more thing to note, we've identified   2 warning signs  with Microchip Technology and understanding these should be part of your investment process.If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?

You can skip our detailed analysis and head straight to our article on 5 Countries With The Highest Taxes on High Incomes.Taxation is a fundamental pillar of modern societies, enabling governments to generate revenue and fund essential public services. Among the various forms of taxes, high-income taxes play a pivotal role in addressing income inequality and ensuring a fair distribution of wealth. These taxes, levied on individuals with significant earnings, serve as a means for governments to secure funds for social welfare programs, infrastructure development, and other public expenditures.According to the Tax Foundation's analysis, the highest-earning Americans bear the greatest tax burden in the US when considering combined federal, state, and local taxes. The top quintile, representing individuals earning $130,001 or more annually, contributed a substantial $3.23 trillion in taxes.In contrast, the bottom quintile, comprising individuals earning less than $25,000 annually, paid significantly less, totalling $142 billion in taxes. This disparity in tax payments highlights the progressive nature of the U.S. tax system, where higher-income individuals contribute a significant portion of the nation's tax revenue.Why fairer progressive taxation is the need of the hour?The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) significantly changed US tax laws, primarily benefiting high-income individuals. It reduced the top tax rate from 39.6% to 37% for couples earning over $600,000 or individuals earning over $500,000. Pass-through businesses were granted a 20% income deduction, predominantly benefiting high-income individuals.The TCJA also weakened the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) and doubled the tax-free exemption for wealth transfer from $11 million to $25.8 million. These changes heavily favoured the wealthiest Americans, with the top 0.1% receiving an average tax cut of $193,380, while middle-income households saw an average reduction of $930.Story continuesWhile the TCJA is set to expire in 2025, discussions regarding its extension are ongoing. This highlights the importance of implementing a fairer progressive taxation system to ensure a more equitable distribution of tax burdens. President Joe Biden has proposed tax reforms to address these disparities and promote a more just tax code.Global trends observed in taxationDigital ReportingIn 2023, the trend of implementing digital reporting requirements will continue to strengthen, impacting businesses globally. The expansion will focus on three main systems:a)     SAF-T, which involves exchanging tax data in XML format.b)     E-invoicing would standardize invoice transmission in XML format, andc)     Real-time reporting, which would mean automatically submitting tax data to tax authorities in real-time.Countries like Portugal, Romania, and Italy are mandating these digital reporting measures, while others like France, Spain, and Germany are also moving towards implementation. This ongoing shift highlights the increasing significance of digitalization and its implications for businesses and tax professionals worldwide.Frequent VAT changes Some countries have implemented changes to VAT rates, such as Finland reducing the rate for electricity supply and Singapore increasing the standard rate. Others have introduced new VAT regimes like Suriname, replacing its turnover tax regime with a 10% standard VAT rate. Additionally, certain countries have adjusted specific sectors, such as Tunisia applying a higher VAT rate to non-commercial professions.Overall, this demonstrates a dynamic landscape where governments are actively recalibrating VAT systems to optimize revenue and address economic challenges like inflation with efforts to align with international standards.Simplifying Tax Filing and Enhancing Compliance - Digital TransformationGovernments worldwide increasingly adopt digital transformation in tax administrations to enhance tax compliance, collect revenue, and simplify tax filing processes. The global volume of data from digital sources is projected to nearly triple from 2020 to 2024, driven by the rise of big data.E-commerce is also growing rapidly, projected to expand 24% from 2020 to 2025, becoming a significant part of the tax base. The use of cashless payments and mobile devices is further fueling this trend. Digitalization not only eases administrative burdens for tax authorities but also simplifies procedures and reduces compliance costs for taxpayers. Research shows a potential 19% reduction in compliance costs in certain countries.It is important to highlight that companies like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) demonstrate the evolving tax landscape for multinational companies operating globally. They address the need for effective tax planning and compliance in an increasingly complex regulatory environment.For instance, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and The Unilever Group (NYSE:UL) have raised concerns about double taxation and withholding taxes in the OECD consultation on pillar one, emphasizing the need to ensure taxpayers are not subjected to additional levies and that Amount A accurately allocates residual profits.15 Countries That Have The Highest Taxes On High IncomesOur methodologyWe ranked the 15 countries that have the highest taxes on high incomes based on the top tax rate of the highest income brackets observed in 2023. The information has been gathered from reputable sources of PWC Tax Summaries for each individual country. All the countries listed observe progressive taxation structures. They are presented in ascending order, starting with the countries with the lowest tax rates, and progressing to the ones with the highest tax rates.15. GermanyTop income tax rate: 42%To address the issue of cold progression, which is the additional tax burden resulting from rising prices, adjustments are being made to the German income tax system. Starting in 2023, the top tax rate of 42 per cent will apply to annual incomes reaching $70,415, compared to the previous threshold of $65,692 in 2022.To provide relief, the basic tax-free allowance (Grundfreibetrag) will also be raised from $11,600 in 2022 to $12,229 in 2023. Only the income exceeding the basic allowance will be subject to taxation. Due to the efficient tax collection structure in the country, Germany was placed on the second rank in the article on 25 countries with the highest standard of living in 2023.14. FranceTop income tax rate: 45%For households, income up to $12,082 is not subject to any tax, resulting in a 0% tax rate. In the next bracket, from $12,082 to $30,804, a tax rate of 11% is applied. As income increases, individuals and households earning above $189,455 face the highest tax rate of 45%.13. ChinaTop income tax rate: 45%The income tax system is structured on different levels based on taxable income amounts subject to cumulative withholding. The first level applies to incomes up to $5,210 and is subject to a withholding rate of 3%. For incomes ranging from $5,210 to $20,800, the second level comes into effect with a higher withholding rate of 10%.12. AustraliaTop income tax rate: 45%An individual resident of Australia must pay income tax on their earnings from both Australian and foreign sources, with certain exceptions for temporary residents and specific types of foreign income and gains.However, non-resident individuals are only liable for Australian income tax on income sourced within Australia, excluding interest, royalties, and dividends, which are generally subject to withholding tax. There are no additional surtaxes, alternative taxes, or other income taxes on personal income in Australia.11. IcelandTop income tax rate: 46.25%In Ireland, personal income is a net income tax base with a progressive state and municipal tax. For annual income between $36,362 and $65,857, the income tax rate increases to 23.28%. The municipal tax remains the same at 14.67%. Consequently, the total tax rate for this range becomes 37.95%.Hence, any income exceeding $65,857 falls into the highest income tax bracket. In this bracket, the income tax rate is 31.85%. The municipal tax rate of 14.67% continues to apply, resulting in a total tax rate of 46.25%.10. SpainTop income tax rate: 47%In 2022, the Spanish Government proposed increasing the tax rates for ""savings income,"" including dividends, interest, and capital gains. It aimed to introduce a new 27% rate for income between $224,800 and $337,200 and a new 28% rate for income exceeding this threshold.Furthermore, taxpayers earning salaries below $16,800 (previously $15,680) will no longer be required to file a tax return, and effective tax rates will be reduced for salaries below $22,071.75.9. PortugalTop income tax rate: 48%For tax purposes, Portugal residents are subject to progressive income tax rates ranging from 14.5% to 48% in 2023. This applies to their worldwide income.On the other hand, non-residents are only obligated to pay income tax on income derived from Portuguese sources. This includes the portion of their earnings attributed to activities conducted in Portugal and remuneration paid by a Portuguese company or permanent establishment (PE). In 2023, non-residents are subject to a flat income tax rate of 25% on their taxable remuneration, regardless of the amount.8. NetherlandsTop income tax rate: 49.5%As part of the approved 2023 Tax Plan in the Netherlands, the Dutch Ministry of Finance has introduced several tax changes. Notably, there will be a reduction in the basic rate of individual income tax from 37.07% to 36.93% for income up to $81,679. The top rate will remain unchanged at 49.5%. These new rates apply to individuals subject to state social security contributions.7. IsraelTop income tax rate: 50%Individuals in Israel are subject to graduated income tax rates reaching up to 47%. Moreover, a 3% surtax on annual taxable income surpasses $192,000, resulting in a maximum income tax rate of 50%. Non-residents are taxed at the same rates as residents. The annual tax brackets are determined by aggregating the monthly brackets, which are adjusted periodically to account for inflation.6. BelgiumTop income tax rate: 50%Belgium imposes income tax on its residents, regardless of their nationality, based on their worldwide income. Non-residents, on the other hand, are only taxed on income derived from sources within Belgium.The calculation of personal income tax (PIT) involves determining the taxable income and applying progressive tax rates to different portions of that income. For the income year 2023, the federal tax rates in Belgium range from 0% to 50%.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Countries That Have The Highest Taxes On High Incomes. Suggested Articles:23 countries Without Income Taxes15 States with the Lowest Business Taxes15 States with the Highest Tax Revenue per CapitaDisclosure: None. 15 Countries With The Highest Taxes On High Incomes is originally published at Insider Monkey.]"

""I think old-fashioned intelligence works pretty well.""AI has taken center stage on Wall Street since OpenAI launched the latest version of ChatGPT in late November. Since then, tech companies have grown increasingly interested in AI as ChatGPT became the fastest-growing app on record, and stocks such as Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and C3.ai. (AI) have skyrocketed.AI has been the focus of earnings calls as tech companies wage an AI war on one another. Alphabet said its AI efforts lost $3.3 billion during the first quarter while Microsoft believes it can help it win market share amid “a generational shift in search.”Microsoft has risen as a leader in the space, investing $10 billion in OpenAI.

22,466ed4e2-f516-3ad1-a2f0-9b0ede2ca934,PH,2023-05-07,Is It Smart To Buy Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) Before It Goes Ex-Dividend?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smart-buy-parker-hannifin-corporation-121832485.html,1683375512,STORY,['PH'],"[Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. In other words, investors can purchase Parker-Hannifin's shares before the 11th of May in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 2nd of June.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.48 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$5.32 to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Parker-Hannifin has a trailing yield of approximately 1.6% on its current stock price of $333.3. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. See our latest analysis for Parker-Hannifin If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Parker-Hannifin paid out a comfortable 45% of its profit last year. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Fortunately, it paid out only 29% of its free cash flow in the past year.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. This is why it's a relief to see Parker-Hannifin earnings per share are up 9.7% per annum over the last five years. Management have been reinvested more than half of the company's earnings within the business, and the company has been able to grow earnings with this retained capital. We think this is generally an attractive combination, as dividends can grow through a combination of earnings growth and or a higher payout ratio over time.Story continuesAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Parker-Hannifin has delivered an average of 12% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.Final TakeawayIs Parker-Hannifin an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Earnings per share growth has been growing somewhat, and Parker-Hannifin is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow as dividends. This is interesting for a few reasons, as it suggests management may be reinvesting heavily in the business, but it also provides room to increase the dividend in time. We would prefer to see earnings growing faster, but the best dividend stocks over the long term typically combine significant earnings per share growth with a low payout ratio, and Parker-Hannifin is halfway there. Overall we think this is an attractive combination and worthy of further research.With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. For example - Parker-Hannifin has 3 warning signs we think you should be aware of.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Sysco (NYSE:SYY), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Sysco with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. See our latest analysis for Sysco Sysco's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingGenerally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Sysco managed to grow EPS by 5.8% per year, over three years. This may not be setting the world alight, but it does show that EPS is on the upwards trend.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. While we note Sysco achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 15% to US$76b. That's a real positive.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time.

You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for Sysco.Are Sysco Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Sysco, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. With a whopping US$67m worth of shares as a group, insiders have plenty riding on the company's success. This should keep them focused on creating long term value for shareholders.Story continuesShould You Add Sysco To Your Watchlist?One positive for Sysco is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. To add an extra spark to the fire, significant insider ownership in the company is another highlight. The combination definitely favoured by investors so consider keeping the company on a watchlist. However, before you get too excited we've discovered 1 warning sign for Sysco that you should be aware of.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read Top 5 High Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Analysts. Dividend stocks have been on investors’ radars for quite some time now because of their ability to generate stable and regular income, lower risk, and tax advantages. Companies in the US also registered investors’ inclination toward dividend equities and steadily boosted their payouts over the years. According to a report by McKinsey &amp; Company, US companies returned 78% of their net income on average in dividends and share repurchases between 1995 and 2021, up from 60% on average between 1965 to 2008. This has boosted investors’ confidence, who are increasingly loading up on dividend stocks, especially during periods of market downturns.High inflationary periods have previously been beneficial for dividend equities because they have the potential to offer higher yields. This is more appealing for investors seeking income that can keep up with inflation. In our article titled 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we reported that dividends accounted for 54% of the market’s returns during decades of high inflation. The report also mentioned that during the 1940s, 1960s, and 1970s, dividends represented 67%, 44%, and 73% of the market’s returns, respectively. During these decades, inflation averaged above 5% with total returns averaging below 10%.When investing in dividend stocks, investors also pay attention to dividend yields as they indicate the amount of income an investor can expect to receive from a dividend-paying stock concerning its price. High dividend-yielding stocks are often considered risky investments because they signal financial distress or underlying problems within a company. However, overall financial health and a solid balance sheet of the respective company can mitigate the risks associated with high yields. Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO), Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), and British American Tobacco p.l.c. (NYSE:BTI) have above-average dividend yields but also have strong dividend histories. For safe investment purposes, investors should focus on dividend growth streaks along with dividend yields.Story continuesThe S&amp;P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats, which tracks the performance of companies with over 20 years of consistent dividend growth and has an average dividend yield of 3.5%, delivered a total return of 590.3% from December 1999 to June 2019, compared with a 215.2% return of the S&amp;P Composite 1500, Insider Monkey reported.Top 20 High Dividend Stocks To Buy According To AnalystsPhoto by Ruben Sukatendel on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we used the Finviz stock screener to identify dividend stocks with yields above 6%, as of May 4.

(NYSE:CWH) is an Illinois-based retail company that mainly sells recreational vehicles. In April, KeyBanc transitioned its coverage on the stock with an Overweight rating and a $25 price target, highlighting the company's earnings potential for 2024 and beyond.On February 28, Camping World Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CWH) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.625 per share, which was in line with its previous dividend. The stock has a dividend yield of 10.65%, as of May 4. The company's cash position remained strong in the first quarter of 2023 as it generated nearly $200 million in operating cash flow. It is among the best dividend stocks on our list.Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO), Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), and British American Tobacco p.l.c. (NYSE:BTI) are some other best dividend stocks with high yields to consider.At the end of Q4 2022, 17 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned stakes in Camping World Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CWH), down from 22 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a collective value of over $171.8 million. With over 5 million shares, Abrams Capital Management was the company's leading stakeholder in Q4.19. Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)Upside Potential as of May 4: 21.3% Average Price Target Based on Analyst Ratings: $114.3 Dividend Yield as of May 4: 5.39%Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is an American multinational tobacco company that sells its products around the world. The company currently offers a quarterly dividend of $1.27 per share for a dividend yield of 5.39%, as of May 5. It is one of the best dividend stocks on our list as it has raised its dividends consistently for the past 14 years.Stifel initiated its coverage on Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) in April with a Buy rating and a $114 price target, calling the company one of the top ideas in the space. The firm also believes that the company offers superior growth potential.As of the close of Q4 2022, 47 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database owned stakes in Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), worth over $6.2 billion collectively.Artisan Partners mentioned Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Our top individual contributors were Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), EOG Resources and Merck. Despite being US-based, tobacco company PM derives all its sales from outside the US. As a result, foreign exchange impacts can be an important driver of near-term returns, and the recent weakening in the US dollar should provide a strong tailwind for earnings due to translation effects. However, our investment case is not tied to currency movements. By virtue of its globally known brands, PM is the best-in-class operator with a well-diversified business, particularly by geography. We believe its next generation heat-not-burn product IQOS should gain share as consumers continue migrating to safer tobacco delivery systems. The company is progressing toward its acquisition of Swedish Match, a Swedish tobacco and nicotine products maker, which was previously held in the portfolio. The deal is a good fit for PM as it reduces PM’s dependence on cigarettes—a category in steady decline—and accelerates the company’s transition to smokeless “reduced-risk” products (RRPs)—a category that has experienced rapid growth over the past five years. PM can also leverage its global scale to generate significant revenue synergies from these complementary product sets, as well as quickly gain access to the US market—the world’s largest market for RRPs and one where regulators have embraced RRPs and other less harmful nicotine products. Looking at PM through our margin-of-safety criteria, the business trades for an undemanding valuation and has extraordinary business economics and a strong credit profile.”18. Coterra Energy Inc.

(NYSE:CTRA), the same as in the previous quarter. These stakes have a collective value of over $582 million.ClearBridge Investments mentioned Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Also on the detractor side, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) delivered a disappointing revenue miss and lowered full-year revenue and earnings guidance as COVID-19-driven demand for PCs abated (where Intel enjoys half its sales) and a delay in its flagship Sapphire Rapids CPU hurt its data center business. Despite these issues, we still believe Intel is an economically sensitive turnaround story with substantial upside.”17. Kinder Morgan, Inc. (NYSE:KMI)Upside Potential as of May 4: 24.6% Average Price Target Based on Analyst Ratings: $20.7 Dividend Yield as of May 4: 6.79%Kinder Morgan, Inc.

Here is what the firm has to say:“U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) shares are ensnared in the bank-run panic that began late in the quarter. Two large banks failed in early March as depositors rushed to withdraw money on concerns that the banks would suffer from liquidity problems. That’s a self-fulfilling prophecy, of course, but in the case of the two banks, it was prompted by the revelations of utter mismanagement of their securities portfolio. Bank models are, essentially, to borrow short and lend long. This sounds dangerous of course, and it would be if not for the deposit guarantee provided by the FDIC. The history of the U.S. banking system can be divided into two eras – pre-FDIC, when bank runs were fairly common, and post-FDIC, when bank runs have been close to non-existent. However, FDIC protection has its limits, and it remains incumbent on management to properly manage its assets and liabilities. The two banks in question didn’t do that. By taking down the share prices of all banks, we think investors are shooting first and asking questions later; they are not distinguishing between the strong and the weak.U.S. Bancorp, as one of the largest and best-managed banks in the country, appears to be a net beneficiary so far of the panic among some depositors, with a pick-up in net deposit inflows in recent weeks. We don’t dismiss the probability of industry contagion – in a true nationwide panic, the big banks will suffer along with the small banks, and the well-managed ones will suffer along with the badly-managed ones. But we think the odds of that are quite small, and recent steps by federal regulators confirm that they will do everything in their power to prevent such a scenario, given the calamitous impact that it would have on our economy. We tightly manage this risk by limiting our exposure to the banking sector.”6. Telephone and Data Systems, Inc.

(NYSE:GS) will increase its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 29th of June to $2.50. The payment will take the dividend yield to 3.1%, which is in line with the average for the industry. Check out our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group Goldman Sachs Group's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWe like to see a healthy dividend yield, but that is only helpful to us if the payment can continue. However, Goldman Sachs Group's earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 43.4% over the next year. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 29% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendGoldman Sachs Group Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $1.84 total annually to $10.00. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 18% over that duration. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Goldman Sachs Group has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 22% per annum. Earnings have been growing rapidly, and with a low payout ratio we think that the company could turn out to be a great dividend stock.Goldman Sachs Group Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach.

(NASDAQ:MAT) shareholders are probably generally happy, the stock hasn't had particularly good run recently, with the share price falling 14% in the last quarter. In contrast, the return over three years has been impressive. In fact, the share price is up a full 106% compared to three years ago. It's not uncommon to see a share price retrace a bit, after a big gain. If the business can perform well for years to come, then the recent drop could be an opportunity.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. Check out our latest analysis for Mattel While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Mattel became profitable within the last three years. Given the importance of this milestone, it's not overly surprising that the share price has increased strongly.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how Mattel has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 0.3% in the last year, Mattel shareholders lost 30%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 4%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 3 warning signs  with Mattel (at least 1 which is significant)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Story continuesOf course Mattel may not be the best stock to buy.

27,545edd0d-4f43-390c-be10-260ab2245c7f,SLB,2023-05-07,We Ran A Stock Scan For Earnings Growth And Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) Passed With Ease,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ran-stock-scan-earnings-growth-110033724.html,1683457233,STORY,['SLB'],"[Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. Check out our latest analysis for Schlumberger Schlumberger's Improving ProfitsSchlumberger has undergone a massive growth in earnings per share over the last three years. So much so that this three year growth rate wouldn't be a fair assessment of the company's future. So it would be better to isolate the growth rate over the last year for our analysis. In impressive fashion, Schlumberger's EPS grew from US$1.49 to US$2.71, over the previous 12 months. It's a rarity to see 82% year-on-year growth like that. That could be a sign that the business has reached a true inflection point.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. The good news is that Schlumberger is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 2.9 percentage points to 15%, over the last year. That's great to see, on both counts.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of Schlumberger's forecast profits?Story continuesAre Schlumberger Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Schlumberger, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$150m. This comes in at 0.2% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.Should You Add Schlumberger To Your Watchlist?Schlumberger's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. This level of EPS growth does wonders for attracting investment, and the large insider investment in the company is just the cherry on top. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. Based on the sum of its parts, we definitely think its worth watching Schlumberger very closely. It's still necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 3 warning signs  with Schlumberger , and understanding these should be part of your investment process.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

28,6bd8ca58-1d5c-3126-a42a-a03a84ec23aa,APTV,2023-05-07,"Vacasa, Inc. (VCSA) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: What to Know Ahead of Q1 Release",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vacasa-inc-vcsa-expected-beat-140202446.html,1683036122,STORY,['APTV'],"[Vacasa, Inc. (VCSA) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 9, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.25 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -92.3%.Revenues are expected to be $232.15 million, down 6.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.13% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Vacasa, Inc.For Vacasa, Inc.The Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +39.02%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Vacasa, Inc. Will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Vacasa, Inc. Would post a loss of $0.41 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.35, delivering a surprise of +185.37%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Vacasa, Inc. Appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Technology Services industry, Aptiv PLC (APTV) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.89 per share for the quarter ended March 2023.

30,420c132a-ce85-3bce-8273-5402a9e99cfb,NFLX,2023-05-07,"Buffett addresses stake in Apple, Occidental Petroleum, and issues warning about the streaming business",Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/buffett-addresses-stake-apple-occidental-213710056.html,1683409030,VIDEO,"['OXY', 'NFLX', 'PARA', 'PARAA', 'PARAP', 'TSM', 'BAC', 'CVX', 'AAPL']","[Warren Buffett addressed his stake in Apple and Occidental Petroleum (OXY), and shared his concerns about the video streaming business on Saturday.Buffett hosted the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting in his hometown of Omaha, Nebraska. The legendary investor was joined by Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A) Vice Chairman Charlie Munger.When asked about his investment in Apple (AAPL), Buffett said, “I don't understand the phone at all, but I do understand consumer behavior.""“Apple is not 35% of Berkshire's portfolio… it just happens to be a better business than any business we own.”He later made comments about his strategy in the energy sector, telling Berkshire shareholders the holding company is not ""going to be making an offer for control of Occidental [Petroleum].”Find more special coverage of the 2023 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting on YahooFinance.com.Video TranscriptBRIAN SOZZI: Of course, we have a rapid-fire section for you as well, hitting a lot of these favorite Yahoo Finance tickers. First off, Apple, of course, Apple is a key holding inside of Berkshire Hathaway. And Myles, naturally, it took a little while to get that Apple question. But it was interesting how it was posed to them.MYLES UDLAND: It did. And we kind of got to it in two ways. I think what will draw the headlines is Buffett saying, I don't understand the product at all, or I don't understand the phone, but I understand the business. He understands the business of selling phones not necessarily how one makes a phone.But that also got into really what I think-- Apple has become the most instructive holding within Berkshire's portfolio. They pay a huge dividend. So every quarter, they're getting hundreds of-- they're getting $100 million check, or it's not-- it's much larger than that. But nine-figure check coming to Berkshire Hathaway.Second thing, they buy back a lot of stock. So Berkshire's holdings in Apple, its percentage of the company that it owns, has gone up organically over time. We saw the announcement on Thursday night from Apple increasing the size of that buyback authorization. So it's going to continue to go up.Story continuesAnd it led to this discussion of how much Apple do you really own? And you look at the equity portfolio. It's about 40%. And Buffett was like, it's not 40%. We own a bunch of other stuff, See's Candies. Garanimals got tons of runs today, kids clothing brand, tons of run today.But basically being like we're not 35% Apple because our equity holdings are only a small chunk of the whole Berkshire family.BRIAN SOZZI: You look at Apple. And you have to think, is this the new Coca-Cola for this generation in terms of an investment for Warren Buffett? Is this Warren Buffett connecting with that next generation of investors?MYLES UDLAND: I mean, I think look, you can kind of say-- and Buffett would probably say this. It doesn't really matter what the product is. They have a dominant position in the market. They make a ton of money. They return a bunch of that money to shareholders. So whether you're selling Coca-Cola or you're selling iPhones, it hits all those criteria.And whatever generation you want to call any company coming from, Buffett's going to like those characteristics.BRIAN SOZZI: Next up, rapid fire session here. Paramount, of course, on Friday, the stock got absolutely slaughtered, slashing its dividend, bad quarter, lots of losses. And one thing that stuck with me from that quarter from Paramount, Myles, when I talk to AmEx's CEO Steven Squeri-- that story is on our home page now. He says, do not surprise Warren Buffett.To me, he sounded surprised at this event. He did not come out and say, Bob Bakish is a phenomenal manager. Of course, that's the CEO of Paramount. He didn't do it. He didn't do it.MYLES UDLAND: Well, we just talked about how Warren Buffett likes companies that return a lot of capital to shareholders. What did Paramount come out and do on Thursday? They cut their dividend. And Buffett says, never good when a company announces a material cut to their dividend. You're trying to shore up your capital position when you can't give it back to your owners basically.So I'll be interested to see what happens with that position. It kind of-- it's a small part of the Berkshire equity portfolio. It kind of came up-- I don't want to say out of nowhere. He has a long history of investing in the media business. But all of a sudden, it's like, oh, Buffett owns a bunch of Paramount. Now he owns 93 million shares of the company.And so we get into the conversation about the streaming wars. And I thought his comments on your eyeballs were quite hilarious.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, eyeballs matter. But in that--MYLES UDLAND: He goes, everyone loves to use their eyes.BRIAN SOZZI: No, yes. It's key. He's clearly bullish eyes. But in that context, there's a lot of competition for our eyeballs, which is why I think that stake in Paramount, disclosed in November last year, raised a lot of eyebrows because it wasn't really Warren Buffetty.MYLES UDLAND: I think everyone thinks the same thing. And look, the 13-F will come out, I guess, what, middle of next week, what they did or didn't do in the first quarter. So I think some questions there with that position.BRIAN SOZZI: We're keeping moving here, Taiwan Semiconductor a position that Buffett took-- what was it, late last year? And then he exited it very quickly, not a very Warren Buffett type of move. But he did hear a lot of praise on that company.MYLES UDLAND: Yeah, I mean, I'll kick this one right back to you because you wrote up a quick story for us on this one. He heaped a lot of praise on it. And he kind of had a-- I don't know. I couldn't make sense of exactly what the point was on not wanting exposure to Taiwan but saying US-China relations might be fine. Everyone has blame. I couldn't quite sort that one out.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah. And if you're an Intel and you're a lot of these other chip-makers, to not hear Warren Buffett say you're doing cool stuff, eh, not exactly a great thing.Lastly, Occidental Petroleum, of course, a lot of investors have been watching Warren Buffett build its position or his position in Occidental Petroleum under the potential, maybe he goes out and just buys the darn company. But Warren said, eh, eh, eh, unlikely to happen.MYLES UDLAND: He came-- he was very blunt. We were not going to make a play to take control of the company. They have approval to buy up to 50% of the outstanding shares. I think they own about 25% today. But yeah, there was an analyst that talked to our Ines Ferre and Josh Shafer last week who surmised maybe Vicki Hollub, CEO, would come in and run Berkshire Hathaway Energy when Greg Abel moves on. I mean, maybe that could happen.BRIAN SOZZI: Ooh, that's good.MYLES UDLAND: Yeah, it was a good one in the story. But Buffett kind of squashing that today.BRIAN SOZZI: And then final takeaways. Myles, to you first.MYLES UDLAND: Really crowded. Man, this place is crowded. Yesterday, extremely stressful going in the convention hall.BRIAN SOZZI: For me, two takeaways. One, amazing to see Warren Buffett, 92 years old, Charlie Munger, 99 old, answering all these questions, in top form. I'm just fascinated by the whole thing. And the next, last but not least, on Monday, ""the Morning Brief"" newsletter, please do check that out, subscribe, whatever. We're looking into the succession battle-- not battle, succession plan here for Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway, lots of interesting little nuggets that our team pulled here from the event.But that's it for yours truly and Myles Udland. We're going to get back and get some air conditioning. It's a little warm here in Omaha, Nebraska. We'll see you guys later.]"

Six years after leaving the role, she opened up this week about things she should have done differently.More from Fortune:  5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from home Looking to make extra cash? This CD has a 5.15% APY right now Buying a house? Here's how much to save This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home “We looked at a transformative acquisition, and we bought Tumblr,” she said in a Tech Brew interview.Yahoo acquired Tumblr, a social blogging platform, for $1.1 billion in 2013—a deal Mayer was heavily involved in. It soon became clear the price was far too high: By 2016, Yahoo had written down Tumblr’s value by more than $700 million.But in addition to Tumblr, she said, the company had considered the possibility of buying Netflix or Hulu.“I think Netflix was $4 billion and Hulu was at $1.3 billion at the time,” she told Tech Brew. “And either of those, with hindsight being 20/20, would have been a better acquisition.”That's something of an understatement. Today Netflix’s market cap tops $140 billion, and Disney has majority-owned Hulu since 2019.As much as Mayer might wish she’d attempted to acquire Netflix, however, the regret runs much deeper among former Blockbuster executives. In 2000, Netflix cofounders Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph tried to sell their startup to Blockbuster for a mere $50 million—and were laughed out of the room.At the time, of course, Netflix was an unprofitable startup offering DVD rentals via postal mail, while Blockbuster stores were a fixture of American life.Today, Mayer is the CEO and cofounder of Sunshine, a startup offering an app that uses A.I. to organize contacts on smartphones. “We mused about naming the company Mundane AI,” she told Tech Brew. “How do you take cutting-edge AI and just apply it to everyday problems that we all have to deal with?”Story continuesMayer shared a few other regrets. She admitted she hired the wrong person to be her chief operating officer. In 2014 she ousted Henrique De Castro, whom she had personally chosen for the role in 2012 despite warnings that it was a mistake and he was overcompensated.And, she said, she wished she had “done the tax-free Alibaba spinoff,” which would have “saved $10 billion for our shareholders or made them that money” and “allowed Yahoo to continue as an independent company.”Three months ago, Yahoo, now owned by Apollo Global Management, said it would eliminate about 1,000 jobs and will further reduce headcount later this year.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

The early response was not positive, with shares down 5.6% to US$93.44 in the past week. Revenues were US$35b, approximately in line with expectations, although statutory earnings per share (EPS) performed substantially better. EPS of US$4.20 were also better than expected, beating analyst predictions by 18%. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year. View our latest analysis for Phillips 66 earnings-and-revenue-growthAfter the latest results, the consensus from Phillips 66's eleven analysts is for revenues of US$144.9b in 2023, which would reflect a definite 14% decline in sales compared to the last year of performance. Statutory earnings per share are forecast to tumble 47% to US$14.41 in the same period. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$146.1b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$15.01 in 2023. So it looks like there's been a small decline in overall sentiment after the recent results - there's been no major change to revenue estimates, but the analysts did make a small dip in their earnings per share forecasts.The consensus price target held steady at US$124, with the analysts seemingly voting that their lower forecast earnings are not expected to lead to a lower stock price in the foreseeable future. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. There are some variant perceptions on Phillips 66, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$141 and the most bearish at US$101 per share. Analysts definitely have varying views on the business, but the spread of estimates is not wide enough in our view to suggest that extreme outcomes could await Phillips 66 shareholders.Story continuesLooking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. We would highlight that sales are expected to reverse, with a forecast 18% annualised revenue decline to the end of 2023. That is a notable change from historical growth of 9.1% over the last five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in the industry are forecast to see their revenue decline 3.7% annually for the foreseeable future. So it's pretty clear that Phillips 66's revenues are expected to shrink faster than the wider industry.The Bottom LineThe most important thing to take away is that the analysts downgraded their earnings per share estimates, showing that there has been a clear decline in sentiment following these results. They also made no changes to their revenue estimates, implying the business is not expected to experience any major impacts to the sales trajectory in the near term, even though sales are expected to trail the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.Keeping that in mind, we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider. We have forecasts for Phillips 66 going out to 2025, and you can see them free on our platform here.However, before you get too enthused, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Phillips 66 that you should be aware of.Have feedback on this article?

This compares to earnings of $1.32 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3.15%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this animal health company would post earnings of $1.15 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.15, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.Zoetis , which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Drugs industry, posted revenues of $2 billion for the quarter ended March 2023, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.44%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.99 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Zoetis shares have added about 21.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 6.5%.What's Next for Zoetis?While Zoetis has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Zoetis: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future.

View our latest analysis for Expedia Group How Fast Is Expedia Group Growing Its Earnings Per Share?Expedia Group has undergone a massive growth in earnings per share over the last three years. So much so that this three year growth rate wouldn't be a fair assessment of the company's future. Thus, it makes sense to focus on more recent growth rates, instead. To the delight of shareholders, Expedia Group's EPS soared from US$1.41 to US$2.20, over the last year. That's a impressive gain of 56%.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. The good news is that Expedia Group is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 4.7 percentage points to 9.8%, over the last year. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below.

While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Expedia Group's future EPS 100% free.Story continuesAre Expedia Group Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$14b company like Expedia Group. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$588m. This suggests that leadership will be very mindful of shareholders' interests when making decisions!It means a lot to see insiders invested in the business, but shareholders may be wondering if remuneration policies are in their best interest. Well, based on the CEO pay, you'd argue that they are indeed. For companies with market capitalisations over US$8.0b, like Expedia Group, the median CEO pay is around US$12m.The CEO of Expedia Group only received US$1.1m in total compensation for the year ending December 2022. First impressions seem to indicate a compensation policy that is favourable to shareholders. While the level of CEO compensation shouldn't be the biggest factor in how the company is viewed, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.Should You Add Expedia Group To Your Watchlist?You can't deny that Expedia Group has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. If you need more convincing beyond that EPS growth rate, don't forget about the reasonable remuneration and the high insider ownership. The overarching message here is that Expedia Group has underlying strengths that make it worth a look at. Before you take the next step you should know about the 1 warning sign for Expedia Group that we have uncovered.Although Expedia Group certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Chief Operating Officer, Frank St. John, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.2m worth of shares at a price of US$474 each. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$456. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.All up, insiders sold more shares in Lockheed Martin than they bought, over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insiders At Lockheed Martin Have Sold Stock RecentlyThere was substantially more insider selling, than buying, of Lockheed Martin shares over the last three months. In total, insiders sold US$9.2m worth of shares in that time. Meanwhile insider John Donovan bought US$251k worth. Since the selling really does outweigh the buying, we'd say that these transactions may suggest that some insiders feel the shares are not cheap.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of Lockheed MartinI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Lockheed Martin insiders own about US$89m worth of shares. That equates to 0.08% of the company. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Lockheed Martin Tell Us?Unfortunately, there has been more insider selling of Lockheed Martin stock, than buying, in the last three months. And our longer term analysis of insider transactions didn't bring confidence, either. Insider ownership isn't particularly high, so this analysis makes us cautious about the company. We'd practice some caution before buying! So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. While conducting our analysis, we found that Lockheed Martin has 2 warning signs and it would be unwise to ignore these.But note: Lockheed Martin may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

(NYSE:ROK) For Its Upcoming Dividend?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-rockwell-automation-inc-nyse-120910757.html,1683461350,STORY,['ROK'],"[Readers hoping to buy Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK) for its dividend will need to make their move shortly, as the stock is about to trade ex-dividend. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Accordingly, Rockwell Automation investors that purchase the stock on or after the 12th of May will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 12th of June.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.18 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$4.72 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Rockwell Automation stock has a trailing yield of around 1.7% on the current share price of $283.42. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. As a result, readers should always check whether Rockwell Automation has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. See our latest analysis for Rockwell Automation Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. That's why it's good to see Rockwell Automation paying out a modest 40% of its earnings. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Over the last year it paid out 60% of its free cash flow as dividends, within the usual range for most companies.It's positive to see that Rockwell Automation's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. Fortunately for readers, Rockwell Automation's earnings per share have been growing at 12% a year for the past five years. Rockwell Automation is paying out a bit over half its earnings, which suggests the company is striking a balance between reinvesting in growth, and paying dividends. This is a reasonable combination that could hint at some further dividend increases in the future.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, Rockwell Automation has increased its dividend at approximately 9.6% a year on average. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.To Sum It UpIs Rockwell Automation worth buying for its dividend? Earnings per share have grown at a nice rate in recent times and over the last year, Rockwell Automation paid out less than half its earnings and a bit over half its free cash flow. It's a promising combination that should mark this company worthy of closer attention.So while Rockwell Automation looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock. To help with this, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Rockwell Automation that you should be aware of before investing in their shares.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read Top 5 High Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Analysts. Dividend stocks have been on investors’ radars for quite some time now because of their ability to generate stable and regular income, lower risk, and tax advantages. Companies in the US also registered investors’ inclination toward dividend equities and steadily boosted their payouts over the years. According to a report by McKinsey &amp; Company, US companies returned 78% of their net income on average in dividends and share repurchases between 1995 and 2021, up from 60% on average between 1965 to 2008. This has boosted investors’ confidence, who are increasingly loading up on dividend stocks, especially during periods of market downturns.High inflationary periods have previously been beneficial for dividend equities because they have the potential to offer higher yields. This is more appealing for investors seeking income that can keep up with inflation. In our article titled 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we reported that dividends accounted for 54% of the market’s returns during decades of high inflation. The report also mentioned that during the 1940s, 1960s, and 1970s, dividends represented 67%, 44%, and 73% of the market’s returns, respectively. During these decades, inflation averaged above 5% with total returns averaging below 10%.When investing in dividend stocks, investors also pay attention to dividend yields as they indicate the amount of income an investor can expect to receive from a dividend-paying stock concerning its price. High dividend-yielding stocks are often considered risky investments because they signal financial distress or underlying problems within a company. However, overall financial health and a solid balance sheet of the respective company can mitigate the risks associated with high yields. Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO), Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), and British American Tobacco p.l.c. (NYSE:BTI) have above-average dividend yields but also have strong dividend histories. For safe investment purposes, investors should focus on dividend growth streaks along with dividend yields.Story continuesThe S&amp;P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats, which tracks the performance of companies with over 20 years of consistent dividend growth and has an average dividend yield of 3.5%, delivered a total return of 590.3% from December 1999 to June 2019, compared with a 215.2% return of the S&amp;P Composite 1500, Insider Monkey reported.Top 20 High Dividend Stocks To Buy According To AnalystsPhoto by Ruben Sukatendel on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we used the Finviz stock screener to identify dividend stocks with yields above 6%, as of May 4.

In April, KeyBanc transitioned its coverage on the stock with an Overweight rating and a $25 price target, highlighting the company's earnings potential for 2024 and beyond.On February 28, Camping World Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CWH) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.625 per share, which was in line with its previous dividend. The stock has a dividend yield of 10.65%, as of May 4. The company's cash position remained strong in the first quarter of 2023 as it generated nearly $200 million in operating cash flow. It is among the best dividend stocks on our list.Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO), Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), and British American Tobacco p.l.c. (NYSE:BTI) are some other best dividend stocks with high yields to consider.At the end of Q4 2022, 17 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned stakes in Camping World Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CWH), down from 22 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a collective value of over $171.8 million. With over 5 million shares, Abrams Capital Management was the company's leading stakeholder in Q4.19. Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)Upside Potential as of May 4: 21.3% Average Price Target Based on Analyst Ratings: $114.3 Dividend Yield as of May 4: 5.39%Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is an American multinational tobacco company that sells its products around the world. The company currently offers a quarterly dividend of $1.27 per share for a dividend yield of 5.39%, as of May 5. It is one of the best dividend stocks on our list as it has raised its dividends consistently for the past 14 years.Stifel initiated its coverage on Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) in April with a Buy rating and a $114 price target, calling the company one of the top ideas in the space. The firm also believes that the company offers superior growth potential.As of the close of Q4 2022, 47 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database owned stakes in Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), worth over $6.2 billion collectively.Artisan Partners mentioned Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Our top individual contributors were Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), EOG Resources and Merck. Despite being US-based, tobacco company PM derives all its sales from outside the US. As a result, foreign exchange impacts can be an important driver of near-term returns, and the recent weakening in the US dollar should provide a strong tailwind for earnings due to translation effects. However, our investment case is not tied to currency movements. By virtue of its globally known brands, PM is the best-in-class operator with a well-diversified business, particularly by geography. We believe its next generation heat-not-burn product IQOS should gain share as consumers continue migrating to safer tobacco delivery systems. The company is progressing toward its acquisition of Swedish Match, a Swedish tobacco and nicotine products maker, which was previously held in the portfolio. The deal is a good fit for PM as it reduces PM’s dependence on cigarettes—a category in steady decline—and accelerates the company’s transition to smokeless “reduced-risk” products (RRPs)—a category that has experienced rapid growth over the past five years. PM can also leverage its global scale to generate significant revenue synergies from these complementary product sets, as well as quickly gain access to the US market—the world’s largest market for RRPs and one where regulators have embraced RRPs and other less harmful nicotine products. Looking at PM through our margin-of-safety criteria, the business trades for an undemanding valuation and has extraordinary business economics and a strong credit profile.”18. Coterra Energy Inc.

(NYSE:CTRA), the same as in the previous quarter. These stakes have a collective value of over $582 million.ClearBridge Investments mentioned Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Also on the detractor side, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) delivered a disappointing revenue miss and lowered full-year revenue and earnings guidance as COVID-19-driven demand for PCs abated (where Intel enjoys half its sales) and a delay in its flagship Sapphire Rapids CPU hurt its data center business. Despite these issues, we still believe Intel is an economically sensitive turnaround story with substantial upside.”17. Kinder Morgan, Inc.

So, with dividends included we’ve made 28% cumulatively over 5-years. Still not good, but not an impairment of capital either.15. Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.

Here is what the firm has to say:“U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) shares are ensnared in the bank-run panic that began late in the quarter. Two large banks failed in early March as depositors rushed to withdraw money on concerns that the banks would suffer from liquidity problems. That’s a self-fulfilling prophecy, of course, but in the case of the two banks, it was prompted by the revelations of utter mismanagement of their securities portfolio. Bank models are, essentially, to borrow short and lend long. This sounds dangerous of course, and it would be if not for the deposit guarantee provided by the FDIC. The history of the U.S. banking system can be divided into two eras – pre-FDIC, when bank runs were fairly common, and post-FDIC, when bank runs have been close to non-existent. However, FDIC protection has its limits, and it remains incumbent on management to properly manage its assets and liabilities. The two banks in question didn’t do that. By taking down the share prices of all banks, we think investors are shooting first and asking questions later; they are not distinguishing between the strong and the weak.U.S. Bancorp, as one of the largest and best-managed banks in the country, appears to be a net beneficiary so far of the panic among some depositors, with a pick-up in net deposit inflows in recent weeks. We don’t dismiss the probability of industry contagion – in a true nationwide panic, the big banks will suffer along with the small banks, and the well-managed ones will suffer along with the badly-managed ones. But we think the odds of that are quite small, and recent steps by federal regulators confirm that they will do everything in their power to prevent such a scenario, given the calamitous impact that it would have on our economy. We tightly manage this risk by limiting our exposure to the banking sector.”6. Telephone and Data Systems, Inc.

(NASDAQ:ILMN) Worth US$200 Based On Its Intrinsic Value?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/illumina-inc-nasdaq-ilmn-worth-130043576.html,1683378043,STORY,['ILMN'],"[Key InsightsIllumina's estimated fair value is US$164 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityIllumina is estimated to be 21% overvalued based on current share price of US$200Our fair value estimate is 33% lower than Illumina's analyst price target of US$244How far off is Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Illumina Step By Step Through The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$381.4mUS$637.0mUS$833.7mUS$921.5mUS$1.29bUS$1.50bUS$1.67bUS$1.82bUS$1.95bUS$2.06bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x3Analyst x4Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 16.16%Est @ 11.94%Est @ 8.99%Est @ 6.93%Est @ 5.48% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.7% US$354US$549US$667US$685US$888US$958US$996US$1.0kUS$1.0kUS$980(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$8.1bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.1b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.7%– 2.1%) = US$38bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$38b÷ ( 1 + 7.7%)10= US$18bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$26b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$200, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Illumina as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.942. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for IlluminaStrengthNet debt to equity ratio below 40%.WeaknessNo major weaknesses identified for ILMN.OpportunityExpected to breakeven next year.Has sufficient cash runway for more than 3 years based on current free cash flows.Good value based on P/S ratio compared to estimated Fair P/S ratio.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value lower than the current share price?

The following table sets forth segment revenues, segment operating income (loss) and operating margins for the periods indicated. Operating margins are calculated by dividing operating income by revenues.Three Months Ended March 31,20232022Revenues:Electric Power Infrastructure Solutions $  2,336,03752.7 %$  2,138,69753.9 %Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions1,008,30022.8875,63222.1Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions1,084,48924.5951,19624.0Consolidated revenues$  4,428,826100.0 %$  3,965,525100.0 %Operating income (loss):Electric Power Infrastructure Solutions (a)215,1499.2 %203,4199.5 %Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions35,6563.5 %69,9428.0 %Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions61,5735.7 %48,1755.1 %Corporate and Non-Allocated Costs (b)(186,518)(4.2) %(204,020)(5.1) %Consolidated operating income$   125,8602.8 %$   117,5163.0 %(a) Included in Electric Power Infrastructure Solutions operating income was equity in earnings of integral unconsolidated affiliates of $9.6 million and $15.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022.(b) Included in corporate and non-allocated costs was amortization expense of $72.4 million and $115.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022; acquisition and integration costs of $19.9 million and $15.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022; and an increase in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities of $5.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. Quanta Services, Inc. and SubsidiariesSupplemental Data(In thousands)(Unaudited)Remaining Performance Obligations and Backlog (a non-GAAP financial measure)Quanta's remaining performance obligations represent management's estimate of consolidated revenues that are expected to be realized from the remaining portion of firm orders under fixed price contracts not yet completed or for which work has not yet begun, which includes estimated revenues attributable to consolidated joint ventures and variable interest entities, revenues from funded and unfunded portions of government contracts to the extent they are reasonably expected to be realized, and revenues from change orders and claims to the extent management believes they will be earned and are probable of collection.Quanta has also historically disclosed its backlog, a measure commonly used in its industry but not recognized under GAAP. Quanta believes this measure enables management to more effectively forecast its future capital needs and results and better identify future operating trends that may not otherwise be apparent. Quanta believes this measure is also useful for investors in forecasting Quanta's future results and comparing Quanta to its competitors. Quanta's remaining performance obligations, as described above, are a component of its backlog calculation, which also includes estimated orders under master service agreements (MSAs), including estimated renewals, and non-fixed price contracts expected to be completed within one year. Quanta's methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodologies used by other companies.The following table reconciles Quanta's total remaining performance obligations to total backlog by reportable segment, along with estimates of amounts expected to be realized within 12 months:March 31, 2023December 31, 2022March 31, 202212 MonthTotal12 MonthTotal12 MonthTotalElectric Power Infrastructure SolutionsRemaining performance obligations$    2,420,570$    3,986,724$    2,124,820$    3,033,472$    2,071,266$    2,731,572Estimated orders under MSAs and short-term, non-fixed price contracts5,145,2339,670,7995,415,42710,049,4354,308,9929,443,108Backlog$    7,565,803$  13,657,523$    7,540,247$  13,082,907$    6,380,258$  12,174,680Renewable Energy Infrastructure SolutionsRemaining performance obligations$    3,914,949$    5,080,689$    3,183,568$    4,638,115$    2,311,389$    2,947,942Estimated orders under MSAs and short-term, non-fixed price contracts166,338230,34157,55584,09470,199132,959Backlog$    4,081,287$    5,311,030$    3,241,123$    4,722,209$    2,381,588$    3,080,901Underground Utility and Infrastructure SolutionsRemaining performance obligations$    1,052,322$    1,189,173$    1,038,543$    1,129,837$       979,652$    1,163,118Estimated orders under MSAs and short-term, non-fixed price contracts1,928,7615,116,4711,973,9825,158,8141,763,4784,035,483Backlog$    2,981,083$    6,305,644$    3,012,525$    6,288,651$    2,743,130$    5,198,601TotalRemaining performance obligations$    7,387,841$  10,256,586$    6,346,931$    8,801,424$    5,362,307$    6,842,632Estimated orders under MSAs and short-term, non-fixed price contracts7,240,33215,017,6117,446,96415,292,3436,142,66913,611,550Backlog$  14,628,173$  25,274,197$  13,793,895$  24,093,767$  11,504,976$  20,454,182 Quanta Services, Inc. and SubsidiariesReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresAdjusted Net Income andAdjusted Diluted Earnings Per ShareAttributable to Common StockFor the Three Months EndedMarch 31, 2023 and 2022 (In thousands, except per share information)(Unaudited)The following table presents the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted net income attributable to common stock to net income attributable to common stock and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock to diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022. These reconciliations are intended to provide useful information to investors and analysts as they evaluate Quanta's performance. Management believes that the exclusion of certain items from net income attributable to common stock and diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock enables it and Quanta's investors to more effectively evaluate Quanta's operations period over period and better identify operating trends that may not otherwise be apparent. However, these non-GAAP measures should not be considered as alternatives to net income attributable to common stock and diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock or other measures of performance that are derived in accordance with GAAP.As to certain of the items in the table: (i) non-cash stock-based compensation expense varies from period to period due to acquisition activity, changes in the estimated fair value of performance-based awards, forfeiture rates, accelerated vesting and amounts granted; (ii) amortization of intangible assets and amortization included in equity in earnings are impacted by Quanta's acquisition activities and investments in integral unconsolidated affiliates, and therefore can vary from period to period; (iii) acquisition and integration costs vary from period to period depending on the level of Quanta's acquisition activity; (iv) change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities varies from period to period depending on the performance in post-acquisition periods of certain acquired businesses and the effect of present value accretion on fair value calculations; (v) equity in (earnings) losses of non-integral unconsolidated affiliates varies from period to period depending on the activity and financial performance of such affiliates, the operations of which are not operationally integral to Quanta; (vi) unrealized mark-to-market adjustments on Quanta's investment in a publicly traded company vary from period to period based on fluctuations in the market price of such company's common stock; and (vii) gains and losses on the sales of investments vary from period to period depending on activity.Beginning with the period ended June 30, 2022, adjusted net income attributable to common stock and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock exclude the impact of equity in (earnings) losses of non-integral unconsolidated affiliates. Management believes that excluding the impact of this item allows Quanta's investors and management to more effectively evaluate Quanta's operations between periods and identify operating trends, since the results of these unconsolidated affiliates' operations are not operationally integral to those of Quanta. Additionally, beginning with the period ended December 31, 2022, adjusted net income attributable to common stock and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock exclude the impact of amortization included in equity in earnings of integral unconsolidated affiliates. Management believes that excluding the impact of this item allows Quanta's investors and management to more effectively evaluate Quanta's operations between periods and identify operating trends. As a result of these changes, the calculation of adjusted net income attributable to common stock and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock for the three months ended March 31, 2022 has been recast to conform to the current presentation.Because adjusted net income attributable to common stock and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock, as defined, exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income attributable to common stock and diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock, they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The most comparable GAAP financial measures, net income attributable to common stock and diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock, and information reconciling the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, are included in the table to follow.Quanta Services, Inc. and SubsidiariesReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresAdjusted Net Income andAdjusted Diluted Earnings Per ShareAttributable to Common StockFor the Three Months EndedMarch 31, 2023 and 2022(In thousands, except per share information)(Unaudited)Three Months EndedMarch 31,20232022Reconciliation of adjusted net income attributable to common stock:Net income attributable to common stock (GAAP as reported)$    95,046$    84,641Adjustments:Acquisition and integration costs (a)19,88815,131Change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities—5,169Equity in earnings of non-integral unconsolidated affiliates(1,617)(5,338)Unrealized loss from mark-to-market adjustment on investment (b)—8,393Gains on sales of investments(822)(6,696)Income tax impact of adjustments (c)(3,963)(4,331)Adjusted net income attributable to common stock before certain non-cash adjustments (d)108,53296,969Non-cash stock-based compensation 27,45122,992Amortization of intangible assets72,403115,751Amortization included in equity in earnings of integral unconsolidated affiliates1,796473Income tax impact of non-cash adjustments (c)(26,457)(36,227)Adjusted net income attributable to common stock (d)$  183,725$  199,958Weighted average shares:Weighted average shares outstanding for diluted and adjusted diluted earnings per share148,661148,082Earnings per share attributable to common stock:Diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock$        0.64$        0.57Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock (d)$        1.24$        1.35(a) The amount for the three months ended March 31, 2022 includes, among other things, expenses associated with change of control payments as a result of the acquisition of Blattner.(b) The amount for the three months ended March 31, 2022 is an unrealized loss related to the fair value remeasurement of Quanta's common stock investment in Starry Group Holdings, Inc., a broadband technology provider.(c) The income tax impact of adjustments that are subject to tax is determined using the incremental statutory tax rates of the jurisdictions to which each adjustment relates for the respective periods.(d) As described above, adjusted net income attributable to common stock before certain non-cash adjustments, adjusted net income attributable to common stock and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock for the three months ended March 31, 2022 have been recast to conform to the current period presentation. Quanta Services, Inc. and SubsidiariesReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAFor the Three Months EndedMarch 31, 2023 and 2022(In thousands)(Unaudited)The following table presents reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to net income attributable to common stock for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022. These reconciliations are intended to provide useful information to investors and analysts as they evaluate Quanta's performance. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest and other financing expenses, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted for certain other items as described below. These measures should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to common stock or other financial measures of performance that are derived in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that the exclusion of these items from net income attributable to common stock enables it and Quanta's investors to more effectively evaluate Quanta's operations period over period and to identify operating trends that might not be apparent when including the excluded items.As to certain of the items below: (i) non-cash stock-based compensation expense varies from period to period due to acquisition activity, changes in the estimated fair value of performance-based awards, forfeiture rates, accelerated vesting and amounts granted; (ii) acquisition and integration costs vary from period to period depending on the level of Quanta's acquisition activity; (iii) equity in (earnings) losses of non-integral unconsolidated affiliates varies from period to period depending on the activity and financial performance of such affiliates, the operations of which are not operationally integral to Quanta; (iv) unrealized mark-to-market adjustments on Quanta's investment in a publicly traded company vary from period to period based on fluctuations in the market price of such company's common stock; (v) gains and losses on the sales of investments vary from period to period depending on activity; and (vi) change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities varies from period to period depending on the performance in post-acquisition periods of certain acquired businesses and the effect of present value accretion on fair value calculations. Because EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, as defined, exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income attributable to common stock, such measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.

This reconciliation is intended to provide useful information to investors and analysts as they evaluate Quanta's ability to generate the cash required to maintain and potentially expand its business. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures. Net capital expenditures is defined as capital expenditures less proceeds from the sale of property and equipment and from insurance settlements related to property and equipment. Management believes that free cash flow provides useful information to Quanta's investors because free cash flow is viewed by management as an important indicator of how much cash is provided or used by routine business operations, including the impact of net capital expenditures. Management uses this measure for capital allocation purposes as it is viewed as a measure of cash available to fund debt payments, acquire businesses, repurchase common stock and debt securities, declare and pay dividends and transact other investing and financing activities. However, this measure should not be considered as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities or other measures of performance that are derived in accordance with GAAP. The most comparable GAAP financial measure, net cash provided by operating activities, and information reconciling the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, are included below.Three Months EndedMarch 31,20232022Net cash provided by operating activities$          38,409$           85,090Less: Net capital expenditures:Capital expenditures(80,319)(109,937)Cash proceeds from sale of property and equipment and related insurance settlements10,7519,001Net capital expenditures(69,568)(100,936)Negative Free Cash Flow$        (31,159)$         (15,846)Other Non-GAAP Definitions:Days Sales Outstanding:Days Sales Outstanding is calculated as the sum of current accounts receivable, net of allowance (which includes retainage and unbilled balances), plus contract assets, less contract liabilities, and divided by average revenues per day during the quarter.Total Liquidity:Total liquidity includes Quanta's cash and cash equivalents and availability under Quanta's senior credit facility. Available commitments for revolving loans under the senior credit facility must be maintained in order to provide credit support for notes issued under the commercial paper program, and therefore such notes effectively reduce the available borrowing capacity under the senior credit facility.Quanta Services, Inc. and SubsidiariesReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresEstimated Adjusted Net Income andAdjusted Diluted Earnings Per ShareAttributable to Common StockFor the Full Year 2023(In thousands, except per share information)(Unaudited)The following table presents reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measure of estimated adjusted net income attributable to common stock to estimated net income attributable to common stock and the non-GAAP financial measure of estimated adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock to estimated diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock for the full year ending December 31, 2023.

We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Marathon Petroleum Step By Step Through The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$9.96bUS$7.53bUS$5.59bUS$5.84bUS$6.05bUS$5.80bUS$5.67bUS$5.62bUS$5.62bUS$5.65bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ -4.07%Est @ -2.21%Est @ -0.92%Est @ -0.01%Est @ 0.63% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 11% US$9.0kUS$6.1kUS$4.1kUS$3.8kUS$3.6kUS$3.1kUS$2.7kUS$2.4kUS$2.2kUS$2.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$39bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 11%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$5.7b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (11%– 2.1%) = US$64bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$64b÷ ( 1 + 11%)10= US$22bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$61b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$107, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 26% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Marathon Petroleum as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 11%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.520. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Marathon PetroleumStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Oil and Gas market.OpportunityGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

In the past, I’ve also been upbeat about the company’s upcoming electric vehicles and its autonomous vehicles subsidiary, Cruise.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMaking me more bullish on the long-term outlook of GM stock, one of the  most well-respected auto-stock analysts, Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas, upgraded the shares to “overweight” from “equal weight.” The analyst wrote that the automaker’s gasoline-powered vehicles had surpassed his expectations, while GM has reduced its spending. Jonas believes that the company’s EV strategy is prudent, as the company is giving itself the opportunity to either accelerate or decelerate its transition to Evs. He set a price target of $38 on the name.ServiceNow (NOW)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is one of the great forever growth stocks to own because it does not have a great deal of competition. It’s growing rapidly. It’s profitable. It saves its customers a great deal of money, and, not surprisingly, NOW’s customers are very loyal to it.Story continuesThose characteristics helped the company report extremely strong first-quarter results on April 26. NOW’s top line soared 22% year-over-year to $2.1 billion, while its backlog climbed 25% YOY, excluding currency changes. On the bottom line, its net income jumped 100% to $150 million. Finally, NOW hiked its fiscal 2023 subscription sales outlook to $8.47 billion to $8.52 billion versus its previous guidance of $8.44 billion to $8,5 billion.Also noteworthy is that 85% of the company’s net new backlog is derived from its current customers.Deutsche Bank responded to the results by raising its price target on NOW stock to $545 from $525. The bank is upbeat on the tech firm’s “execution” and believes that NOW “is being prioritized by customers in a volatile macro environment,” The Fly reported.ON Semiconductor (ON)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON) is another name I’m bullish on. In my April 4 column on “stocks to buy for the massive rally ahead,” I expressed bullishness about ON due to its high leverage to the quickly growing automotive and industrial chip markets.ON’s first-quarter results demonstrated that the chip maker is indeed a big beneficiary of the large increases in the number of semiconductors being utilized by automakers and industrial companies.Specifically, its automotive revenue jumped a huge 38% year-over-year last quarter, enabling its top line to come in $30 million above analysts’ average estimate. The company’s industrial sales increased 1% in Q1 versus Q4, even though Q4 is much seasonally stronger than Q1.Amazon.com (AMZN)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Many investors are concerned that Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) cloud unit revenue climbed just 11% year-over-year last month and increased only 16% year-over-year in its fiscal Q1. However, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy noted that AWS is intensively utilizing AI, and is incorporating technology from a number of top AI startups in its cloud offerings. As a result, I’m bullish on the longer-term outlook of AWS.Making me even more upbeat on Amazon’s longer-term potential, Morgan Stanley thinks that AWS can benefit from exploiting the “largely untapped” public clouds market. The bank estimates the total value of this sector at an incredible $2.5 trillion.On the e-commerce front, Amazon should benefit in the medium-to-long term from the normalization of consumers’ goods-to-experiences spending ratio. Moreover, its dominance in e-commerce throughout much of the Western world is unlikely to be challenged in the foreseeable future.Also encouragingly, Jassy reported that the company’s prescription drug business, Amazon Pharmacy launched in 2020, is “off to a good start” and “continuing to grow.” Staying with the healthcare space, I agree with Jassy’s assessment that the company can use the network of clinics that it acquired, together with Amazon Clinic, to build a sizeable, needle-moving healthcare business.MGM (MGM)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comIn line with my previous predictions, MGM (NYSE:MGM) is clearly clicking on all cylinders as both Las Vegas and Macau casinos make big comebacks.MGM reported standout first-quarter results, as its top line soared 36% versus the same period a year earlier to $3.87 billion, $280 million above analysts’ average estimate. The casino operator’s property EBITDAR, excluding certain items, climbed 41% year-over-year to a record $1.1 billion.Conventions are returning to Las Vegas, and the city and MGM will benefit from many other positive catalysts, including the popular  Formula One auto race later this year, the city’s relatively new NFL team, and, potentially, a Major League Baseball team down the road.MGM’s gross gaming revenue from Macau came in at 78% of the levels of Q1 2019, and its revenue from the region should climb meaningfully as China’s travel boom continues. MGM’s online betting joint venture, BetMGM reported that its revenue jumped 76% year-over-year last quarter, while its overall market share was a significant 17%. MGM expects BetMGM to become profitable by the end of this year. As more parts of the U.S. allow online betting and BetMGM’s brand strengthens, the joint venture’s profit should jump tremendously.McDonald’s (MCD)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comMcDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) is clearly a very popular institution, and that status is unlikely to change in the years ahead. Moreover, due to its relatively cheap offerings, MCD stock will not drop drastically during economic downturns.Its tremendous popularity is reflected by many data points, including the fact that its traffic rose in all of its operating regions last quarter, despite the significant price increases that it implemented, while its global same-store sales jumped 12.6% year-over-year. As a result of those price hikes and traffic gains., MCD expects to generate a healthy operating margin of roughly 45% this year.In the wake of McDonald’s Q1 results, BMO Capital raised its price target on the stock to $325 from $300 as the bank believes that the restaurant chain’s “strong momentum” and market share increases should continue going forward. BMO kept an “outperform” rating on the shares.JPMorgan (JPM)image of businessperson and bar graph with dollar signs to represent undervalued stocksSource: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.comAfter acquiring First Republic’s attractive assets in a “sweetheart” deal, JPMorgan has become very attractive to conservative, long-term investors.According to my estimates, the transaction will give JPM $62 billion of net new deposits ($92 billion of deposits less $25 billion that JPM will refund to other large banks that put money in FRC in March and $5 billion that JPM placed in First Republic).  The deal is expected to raise the bank’s bottom line by an estimated $500 million annually. All while it paid $10.6 billion for “$18B in net assets ”The deal will also add a meaningful number of new, very rich wealth management clients to JPM’s roster and many other high net worth clients. Moreover, the FDIC has agreed to ” cover 80% of credit losses over the next seven years for the residential mortgages  [of First Republic’s assets acquired by JPM]and the next five years for the commercial loan portfolio.”JPM’s EPS is now expected to climb to $14.87 in 2025, up from $12.09 last year. Given the fact that JPM has said its estimates of its profits from the First Republic deal are conservative and I believe that many analysts are underestimating the strength of the U.S. economy, I wouldn’t be surprised if its EPS comes in at around $17 in 2025.If my estimate proves correct, the shares are trading for eight times its 2025 EPS, which is an attractive valuation.As of the date of publication, Larry Ramer owned shares of MGM.

The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$82.09 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$73.91. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Amphenol's current trading price of US$75.71 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Amphenol’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Amphenol What Is Amphenol Worth?The stock is currently trading at US$75.71 on the share market, which means it is overvalued by 33% compared to my intrinsic value of $56.75. Not the best news for investors looking to buy! But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Amphenol’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What kind of growth will Amphenol generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by a double-digit 14% over the next couple of years, the outlook is positive for Amphenol. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in APH’s positive outlook, with shares trading above its fair value. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe APH should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on APH for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for APH, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

In other words, you can envision a typical financial advisor speaking well of these enterprises. This just proves that you can’t judge a book by its cover.Another reason to consider meme stocks with fundamentals centers on the broader enthusiasm of the retail investor community. Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, financial advisors bemoaned that millennials weren’t getting involved in the market. Now, they are and it’s possible that this sentiment shift may be permanent. Thus, the increased attention to the equities sector may lift all boats.Finally, millennials and also older members of Generation Z enjoy rising spending power. Therefore, the securities they like should theoretically see price appreciation. Therefore, here’s my list for meme stocks 2023 (that actually makes sense).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAAPLApple$168.54NVDANvidia$282.10MARMarriott$178.61CATCaterpillar$215.15CVXChevron$160.04AMZNAmazon.com$103.63IBKRInteractive Brokers$74.13Meme Stocks to Buy: Apple (AAPL)Apple store. Apple Inc. (AAPL) sells consumer electronics, computer software, services and personal computers.Source: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.comAs a consumer technology giant, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) offers a sensible – if not boring – idea for the best meme stocks to buy. For years, marketing professionals identified Apple as a brand powerhouse. To this day, the tech stalwart continues to enjoy the status of the most valuable brand in the world. Whether we’re dealing with pandemics or bank runs, consumers can’t get enough of Apple’s digital devices.On the financial side, Apple brings plenty of firepower to the table. Operationally, the company commands a three-year revenue growth rate of 20%, above 86.44% of sector rivals. Also, it posts a free cash flow (FCF) growth rate of 29.2%, beating out 76% of its peers.On the bottom line, Apple prints a trailing-year net margin of 24.56%, outpacing nearly 96% of rivals. It’s also consistently profitable over the past 10 years. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg AAPL as a consensus strong buy. However, the average price target of $174.85 implies only 3% upside potential.Story continuesMeme Stocks to Buy: Nvidia (NVDA)Nvidia (NVDA) logo and sign on headquarters. Blurred foreground with green treesSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comAs a tech firm that garnered fame for its graphics processing units (GPUs), it’s no surprise that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks among the best meme stocks to buy. Sure, these GPUs undergird video gaming applications, which obviously appeal to millennials and Gen Z. At the same time, its processors support other far-reaching endeavors such as data centers and artificial intelligence.Financially, Nvidia benefits from significant strengths in the balance sheet, particularly its stratospheric Altman Z-Score of 23.39. This stat indicates high fiscal stability and a low risk of imminent bankruptcy. On the operational side, Nvidia posts a three-year revenue growth rate of 34.5%, above 87.72% of companies listed in the semiconductors industry.For profitability, its trailing-year net margin pings at a strong 16.19%, above 70.56% of rivals. However, a noticeable drawback is the forward multiple of 61.73, which is very overpriced. Unsurprisingly, analysts peg NVDA as a consensus strong buy. However, their price target of $286.94 implies a little over 3% upside potential.Meme Stocks to Buy: Marriott (MAR)an empty, sunlit hotel roomSource: ShutterstockBreaking away from the tech-oriented meme stocks to buy, Marriott (NASDAQ:MAR) presents intrigue for market participants. Notably, Gen Z desires experiences over more tangible achievements that prior generations aimed for. Thus, some market analysts believe that young folks will help spark a travel resurgence, especially since virtually all jurisdictions have relaxed their Covid-mitigation protocols.Financially, Marriott presents somewhat of a mixed bag. On paper, its balance sheet appears rather challenged, particularly its cash-to-debt ratio of 0.05. That’s worse than about 89% of the competition. However, the pandemic did a number on the space. On a more positive note, Marriott’s three-year revenue growth rate comes out to 0.7%, which actually beats out nearly 65% of its peers.On the bottom line, Marriott enjoys a trailing-year net margin of 11.35%, above 74% of companies listed in the travel and leisure space. Thus, it could be one of the meme stocks with potential, especially if Gen Z shows up. Analysts peg MAR as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $183.18, implying over 8% upside potential.Caterpillar (CAT)man's hand holding wads of cashSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comA rather surprising entry among the best meme stocks to buy, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) carries serious clout as a top manufacturer of construction equipment. Frankly, the idea seems rather boring for young investors but they’re also onto something. Aside from the infrastructure bill, several nations will look to rebuild following Covid’s disruption. Thus, Caterpillar could rise higher.Interestingly, according to investment resource Gurufocus, CAT stock enjoys five good signs and no yellow or red flags. In my view, Caterpillar’s best attributes center on its profitability profile. For example, its operating and net margins ping at 14.86% and 11.28%, respectively. Both stats rank better than at least 87% of the competition.However, one less-than-desirable feature may be its valuation. Right now, CAT trades at a forward multiple of 13.7, ranked worse than 61.36% of its peers. Analysts peg CAT as a consensus hold. Nevertheless, their average price target comes out to $240.47, implying nearly 10% upside potential.Chevron (CVX)Chevron (CVX) sing with ""diesel,"" ""food mart"" and ""car wash"" written underneathSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comOne of the world’s biggest oil and natural gas companies, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) deserves to sit at the table of best meme stocks to buy. About a month ago, the oil cartel known as OPEC+ decided to impose a surprise production cut. Effectively, the cartel also proved that the Federal Reserve will not be the only entity to strongly influence the dollar. For investors, the hydrocarbon players suddenly got more interesting.Despite operating in a somewhat controversial industry, CVX clearly ranks among the meme stocks with fundamentals. It enjoys a stout balance sheet, with an equity-to-asset ratio of 0.62 times, better than 66% of its peers. Operationally, Chevron’s three-year revenue growth rate pings at 18.1%, outflanking 69.72% of sector rivals.On the bottom line, Chevron has a trailing-year net margin of 15.05%, beating out 68.62% of the competition. Aside from the Covid-disrupted 2020, it’s also consistently profitable. Finally, analysts peg CVX as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target hits $190.44, implying 13% upside potential.Amazon (AMZN)Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stockSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comMoving onto the riskiest segment of meme stocks to buy, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) previously dominated the equities sphere. However, 2022 imposed heavy headwinds on AMZN, particularly due to skyrocketing inflation. With the consumer economy hurting, people didn’t open their wallets with vigor for discretionary products. As a result, even with AMZN’s strong performance this year, over the past 365 days, it’s down over 15%.Still, AMZN may be worth a look for those seeking speculative meme stocks with potential. Despite the ravages of last year, Amazon still looks relatively decent. For instance, its three-year revenue growth rate comes out to 21.9%, above 84.38% of companies in the cyclical retail industry.To be fair, its trailing-year net margin slipped to 0.53% below zero. However, with Amazon’s other relevancies in cloud computing and other tech spheres, it’s worth a wager for the gambling type. Lastly, analysts peg AMZN as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target stands at $137.62, implying almost 31% upside potential.Interactive Brokers (IBKR)An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""Source: PX Media / ShutterstockIn my opinion, Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR) ranks as the riskiest idea for the best meme stocks to buy. With the Fed committed to tackling inflation by hiking the benchmark interest rate, circumstances don’t seem auspicious for market trading. At the same time, millennials and Gen Z may have sparked a paradigm shift in how they view money. So, it’s possible that IBKR could swing higher.So far, shares have performed well, gaining 9% since the January opener. In the trailing year, IBKR impresses with a 30% return. On the financial side, it’s a bit of a wobbly picture. Conspicuously, its balance sheet seems weak. For instance, its Altman Z-Score of only 0.29 indicates distress and a higher risk of bankruptcy in the next two years.On the plus side, Interactive’s consistently profitable. Its operating margin is also impressive at nearly 46%. As well, IBKR trades at 2.02 times FCF, which is significantly undervalued. Enticingly, analysts peg IBKR as a unanimous strong buy. Their average price target hits $111.40, implying over 43% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

60,d43f4f7a-0b55-336e-a82a-f28c23a40448,SNA,2023-05-07,Is Snap-on Incorporated's (NYSE:SNA) Recent Stock Performance Tethered To Its Strong Fundamentals?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/snap-incorporateds-nyse-sna-recent-133843002.html,1683380323,STORY,['SNA'],"[Snap-on's (NYSE:SNA) stock is up by a considerable 14% over the past month. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Specifically, we decided to study Snap-on's  ROE in this article.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for Snap-on How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Snap-on is:21% = US$966m ÷ US$4.6b (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.21 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Snap-on's Earnings Growth And 21% ROETo start with, Snap-on's ROE looks acceptable. Further, the company's ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 13%. Probably as a result of this, Snap-on was able to see a decent growth of 8.7% over the last five years.We then performed a comparison between Snap-on's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 8.3% in the same period.Story continuespast-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is SNA worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether SNA is currently mispriced by the market.Is Snap-on Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Snap-on has a healthy combination of a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 34% (or a retention ratio of 66%) and a respectable amount of growth in earnings as we saw above, meaning that the company has been making efficient use of its profits.Additionally, Snap-on has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 40%. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that Snap-on's future ROE will be 18% which is again, similar to the current ROE.SummaryOverall, we are quite pleased with Snap-on's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future. To know more about the company's future earnings growth forecasts take a look at this free report on analyst forecasts for the company to find out more.Have feedback on this article?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read Top 5 High Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Analysts. Dividend stocks have been on investors’ radars for quite some time now because of their ability to generate stable and regular income, lower risk, and tax advantages. Companies in the US also registered investors’ inclination toward dividend equities and steadily boosted their payouts over the years. According to a report by McKinsey &amp; Company, US companies returned 78% of their net income on average in dividends and share repurchases between 1995 and 2021, up from 60% on average between 1965 to 2008. This has boosted investors’ confidence, who are increasingly loading up on dividend stocks, especially during periods of market downturns.High inflationary periods have previously been beneficial for dividend equities because they have the potential to offer higher yields. This is more appealing for investors seeking income that can keep up with inflation. In our article titled 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we reported that dividends accounted for 54% of the market’s returns during decades of high inflation. The report also mentioned that during the 1940s, 1960s, and 1970s, dividends represented 67%, 44%, and 73% of the market’s returns, respectively. During these decades, inflation averaged above 5% with total returns averaging below 10%.When investing in dividend stocks, investors also pay attention to dividend yields as they indicate the amount of income an investor can expect to receive from a dividend-paying stock concerning its price. High dividend-yielding stocks are often considered risky investments because they signal financial distress or underlying problems within a company. However, overall financial health and a solid balance sheet of the respective company can mitigate the risks associated with high yields. Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO), Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), and British American Tobacco p.l.c. (NYSE:BTI) have above-average dividend yields but also have strong dividend histories. For safe investment purposes, investors should focus on dividend growth streaks along with dividend yields.Story continuesThe S&amp;P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats, which tracks the performance of companies with over 20 years of consistent dividend growth and has an average dividend yield of 3.5%, delivered a total return of 590.3% from December 1999 to June 2019, compared with a 215.2% return of the S&amp;P Composite 1500, Insider Monkey reported.Top 20 High Dividend Stocks To Buy According To AnalystsPhoto by Ruben Sukatendel on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we used the Finviz stock screener to identify dividend stocks with yields above 6%, as of May 4.

(NYSE:PM), worth over $6.2 billion collectively.Artisan Partners mentioned Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Our top individual contributors were Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), EOG Resources and Merck. Despite being US-based, tobacco company PM derives all its sales from outside the US. As a result, foreign exchange impacts can be an important driver of near-term returns, and the recent weakening in the US dollar should provide a strong tailwind for earnings due to translation effects. However, our investment case is not tied to currency movements. By virtue of its globally known brands, PM is the best-in-class operator with a well-diversified business, particularly by geography. We believe its next generation heat-not-burn product IQOS should gain share as consumers continue migrating to safer tobacco delivery systems. The company is progressing toward its acquisition of Swedish Match, a Swedish tobacco and nicotine products maker, which was previously held in the portfolio. The deal is a good fit for PM as it reduces PM’s dependence on cigarettes—a category in steady decline—and accelerates the company’s transition to smokeless “reduced-risk” products (RRPs)—a category that has experienced rapid growth over the past five years. PM can also leverage its global scale to generate significant revenue synergies from these complementary product sets, as well as quickly gain access to the US market—the world’s largest market for RRPs and one where regulators have embraced RRPs and other less harmful nicotine products. Looking at PM through our margin-of-safety criteria, the business trades for an undemanding valuation and has extraordinary business economics and a strong credit profile.”18. Coterra Energy Inc.

Here is what the firm has to say:“U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) shares are ensnared in the bank-run panic that began late in the quarter. Two large banks failed in early March as depositors rushed to withdraw money on concerns that the banks would suffer from liquidity problems. That’s a self-fulfilling prophecy, of course, but in the case of the two banks, it was prompted by the revelations of utter mismanagement of their securities portfolio. Bank models are, essentially, to borrow short and lend long. This sounds dangerous of course, and it would be if not for the deposit guarantee provided by the FDIC. The history of the U.S. banking system can be divided into two eras – pre-FDIC, when bank runs were fairly common, and post-FDIC, when bank runs have been close to non-existent. However, FDIC protection has its limits, and it remains incumbent on management to properly manage its assets and liabilities. The two banks in question didn’t do that. By taking down the share prices of all banks, we think investors are shooting first and asking questions later; they are not distinguishing between the strong and the weak.U.S. Bancorp, as one of the largest and best-managed banks in the country, appears to be a net beneficiary so far of the panic among some depositors, with a pick-up in net deposit inflows in recent weeks. We don’t dismiss the probability of industry contagion – in a true nationwide panic, the big banks will suffer along with the small banks, and the well-managed ones will suffer along with the badly-managed ones. But we think the odds of that are quite small, and recent steps by federal regulators confirm that they will do everything in their power to prevent such a scenario, given the calamitous impact that it would have on our economy. We tightly manage this risk by limiting our exposure to the banking sector.”6. Telephone and Data Systems, Inc.

Six years after leaving the role, she opened up this week about things she should have done differently.More from Fortune:  5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from home Looking to make extra cash? This CD has a 5.15% APY right now Buying a house? Here's how much to save This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home “We looked at a transformative acquisition, and we bought Tumblr,” she said in a Tech Brew interview.Yahoo acquired Tumblr, a social blogging platform, for $1.1 billion in 2013—a deal Mayer was heavily involved in. It soon became clear the price was far too high: By 2016, Yahoo had written down Tumblr’s value by more than $700 million.But in addition to Tumblr, she said, the company had considered the possibility of buying Netflix or Hulu.“I think Netflix was $4 billion and Hulu was at $1.3 billion at the time,” she told Tech Brew. “And either of those, with hindsight being 20/20, would have been a better acquisition.”That's something of an understatement. Today Netflix’s market cap tops $140 billion, and Disney has majority-owned Hulu since 2019.As much as Mayer might wish she’d attempted to acquire Netflix, however, the regret runs much deeper among former Blockbuster executives. In 2000, Netflix cofounders Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph tried to sell their startup to Blockbuster for a mere $50 million—and were laughed out of the room.At the time, of course, Netflix was an unprofitable startup offering DVD rentals via postal mail, while Blockbuster stores were a fixture of American life.Today, Mayer is the CEO and cofounder of Sunshine, a startup offering an app that uses A.I. to organize contacts on smartphones. “We mused about naming the company Mundane AI,” she told Tech Brew. “How do you take cutting-edge AI and just apply it to everyday problems that we all have to deal with?”Story continuesMayer shared a few other regrets. She admitted she hired the wrong person to be her chief operating officer. In 2014 she ousted Henrique De Castro, whom she had personally chosen for the role in 2012 despite warnings that it was a mistake and he was overcompensated.And, she said, she wished she had “done the tax-free Alibaba spinoff,” which would have “saved $10 billion for our shareholders or made them that money” and “allowed Yahoo to continue as an independent company.”Three months ago, Yahoo, now owned by Apollo Global Management, said it would eliminate about 1,000 jobs and will further reduce headcount later this year.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

(NYSE:APD) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 86% of the company",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/air-products-chemicals-inc-nyse-110052443.html,1683457252,STORY,['APD'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Air Products and Chemicals' stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisionsThe top 21 shareholders own 50% of the companyUsing data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a companyA look at the shareholders of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (NYSE:APD) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 86% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Air Products and Chemicals. View our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Air Products and Chemicals?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Air Products and Chemicals does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Air Products and Chemicals' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Air Products and Chemicals. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.3% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 6.5% and 5.8%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 21 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Air Products and ChemicalsWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$219m of stock.

But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last three years have been very strong. Indeed, the share price is up a very strong 297% in that time. After a run like that some may not be surprised to see prices moderate. The fundamental business performance will ultimately dictate whether the top is in, or if this is a stellar buying opportunity.Although Devon Energy has shed US$2.0b from its market cap this week, let's take a look at its longer term fundamental trends and see if they've driven returns. See our latest analysis for Devon Energy While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Devon Energy became profitable within the last three years. That kind of transition can be an inflection point that justifies a strong share price gain, just as we have seen here.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Devon Energy's TSR for the last 3 years was 387%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 0.3% in the last year, Devon Energy shareholders lost 22% (even including dividends). However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 9% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For example, we've discovered 3 warning signs for Devon Energy (1 is concerning!) that you should be aware of before investing here.Devon Energy is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

Not surprisingly, the market for frozen ready-to-cook potato products is a large one, and Lamb Weston has a leading position. Increasingly, pre-made fries have become popular in other sales channels such as grocery stores as well.Unfortunately, investors have taken a good idea much too far. LW stock is now up more than 70% over the past 12 months. This is a rather remarkable move for a company that had struggled to grow revenues for much of the past five years. The current inflationary wave has allowed Lamb Weston to raise prices, but once economic conditions normalize, Lamb Weston’s momentum is likely to run out.Story continuesStocks to Sell: Oracle (ORCL)A white clock indicates it's time to sell.Source: ShutterstockLegacy tech company Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) has surged to life in recent months. From a low of $61 last fall, shares have soared to $95. This is a big move for a company whose stock did nothing for the majority of the 2010s and which saw its revenues flatline in recent years.The core issue for Oracle is that its main business is in decline. Oracle is the undisputed leader in on-premise databases and enterprise resource management. But demand for those services has weakened as companies move more of their workflows to the cloud.Oracle is attempting to address this by offering its own cloud solutions. And, to its credit, Oracle has gained some traction with its own cloud business winning key customers such as TikTok. That said, cloud growth appears to be slowing down overall, at least judging by results from larger rivals such as Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS.With the overall slowdown in the tech industry, the recent bump in Oracle’s results seems unlikely to last long. Morningstar sees shares as trading at a wide 41% premium to fair value today. Oracle is another one of the top stocks to sell.Stocks to Sell: Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL)little girl holding a stock chart with athumbs down. stocks to avoidSource: ShutterstockOld Dominion Freight Line (NASDAQ:ODFL) is a trucking company. Many investors think of trucking as a low-margin commodity business, and that’s often true. Unfortunately, it’s another one of the top stocks to sell now.Old Dominion has carved out a niche for itself by becoming the most successful operator in less-than-truckload cargos. This is a more specialty part of the trucking business, and Old Dominion has ridden it to great success. Indeed, shares are up a shocking 1,100% over the past decade. But investors may be giving the company way too much credit at this point. Shares are going for 29 times forward earnings, which is awfully rich for a trucking company, even a well-run one.And economic worries will hit Old Dominion sooner or later. Its revenue growth turned negative this quarter while tonnage slumped 12%. That’s even with consumer spending trends still in decent shape. If a full-blown recession hits, look out way below on ODFL stock.e.l.f. Beauty (ELF)a frustrated man with a white board behind him that features a black downward arrowSource: Shutterstocke.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF) is a cosmetics and personal care company and is another one of the top stocks to sell. It is distinct from many rivals thanks to a strong direct-to-consumer approach. In recent years, as commerce has shifted from old models such as shopping malls to digital channels, investors have rewarded companies with a strong online sales channel.Adding to that, demand for cosmetics and beauty products has soared over the past year as the economy has reopened and people have been willing to spend more on looking good. All this has added up to a remarkable comeback story for e.l.f. Beauty, with its stock rising a stunning 275% over the past year.However, at some point, this rally will be hard to sustain. Shares are up to a whopping 65 times forward earnings at today’s price. Also, of note, the company’s stock price was essentially flat between its 2016 IPO and 2022. The company was not impressing investors or analysts for most of its history, and investors should be cautious that last year’s success may prove to be a flash in the pan. That’s especially true as the company just exited the Chinese market.Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS)earningsSource: ShutterstockDick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) is a retailer focused on sporting and outdoor goods and apparel. The firm enjoyed a tremendous upturn in sales during the pandemic as people took up new hobbies that were socially distanced. It was a great time for activities such as camping and fishing, and people were willing to spend a lot of money given that so many alternatives were shut down.DKS stock is up more than 350% over the past five years. That’s a wild result for what would normally be a fairly sleepy retailer. And, purely on the basis of trailing earnings, shares might still seem reasonably priced.However, it seems that a post-pandemic hangover will be coming for sporting goods sooner or later. Profit margins are currently at elevated levels, but expect things to return to more normal levels as the sales cycle slows down, inventory builds, and Dick’s eventually has to use more aggressive discounting to sell its sporting goods. As far as worst stocks to own heading into a potential recession go, sporting goods companies would be right near the top of the list.Mettler-Toledo International (MTD)a keyboard with a greet enter key marked sell, representing overvalued stocks to sellSource: ShutterstockMettler-Toledo International (NYSE:MTD) is an intriguing healthcare and industrial company focused on scales and measurement. It makes scales for applications such as laboratories, factories, grocery and food industry applications, and so on. It has other such items as pH meters, metal detectors, thermal analysis tools, and so on.There’s no doubt that these are valuable mission-critical tools that serve a wide variety of applications. However, valuation is a concern. Investors are, it would seem, fully aware of the high quality of Mettler-Toledo’s business. MTD stock is trading at a lofty 34 times forward earnings. That’s a pretty hefty level for a company that has a steady business but relatively modest growth prospects. That’s especially true as the healthcare element of the business saw a boost from recent spending around the pandemic and appears to have slowing opportunities in 2023.Morningstar has MTD stock as one of the most overvalued names that it covers. In fact, its analyst, Julie Utterback sees fair value at just $830, which would represent a massive downside from today’s $1,500 price.Church &amp; Dwight (CHD)sell written on a chalkboard representing overvalued stocks to sellSource: ShutterstockA lot of investors have been nervous about valuations in the consumer staples space. Over the past year, these companies have raised prices dramatically to benefit from the current inflationary wave. That has made for a beneficial effect on profits at these companies, and investors have bid many of them up to historically high valuations. However, there is danger in extrapolating this sort of profit growth forever.Church &amp; Dwight (NYSE:CHD) is one such example. The firm makes a wide variety of consumer goods such as baking powder, condoms, pregnancy tests, and air fresheners.These are all fine products that should have a fairly steady demand. But there are limits to growth in these sorts of categories. Church &amp; Dwight has only grown revenues at 6% per year annualized over the past decade, and yet shares are now selling for more than 32 times forward earnings.

Both its quarterly revenues and core funds from operations (FFO) per share are likely to have seen year-over-year increases.In the last reported quarter, this self-storage real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a surprise of 4.26% in terms of core FFO per share. Results reflected better-than-anticipated top-line growth. The company also benefited from its expansion efforts through acquisitions, developments and extensions.Over the last four quarters, Public Storage surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on all occasions, the average beat being 2.43%. The graph below depicts the surprise history of the company:Public Storage Price and EPS SurprisePublic Storage Price and EPS SurprisePublic Storage price-eps-surprise | Public Storage QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement.Key FactorsPublic Storage is likely to have gained from its solid presence in key cities and high brand value in the first quarter. PSA is also likely to have benefited from its technological advantage amid favorable market fundamentals and maintained a healthy balance sheet position.In addition, the company has been capitalizing on growth opportunities. In the fourth quarter, Public Storage acquired 30 self-storage facilities comprising 1.6 million net rentable square feet of area for $228.6 million.Following Dec 31, 2022, the company acquired or was under contract to buy eight self-storage facilities spanning 0.5 million net rentable square feet of space for $70.5 million. Such acquisition and expansion initiatives are anticipated to have stoked the company’s growth during the period under consideration.Amid these, Public Storage is likely to have seen growth in revenues in the quarter to be reported. Also, PSA has one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector with adequate liquidity to bank on expansion opportunities through acquisitions and developments. This is likely to have continued in the first quarter as well.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues stands at $1.09 billion. This calls for a 12.08% year-over-year increase.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues from self-storage facilities stands at $1.02 billion. This suggests an increase from the $ 917.02 million witnessed in the year-ago period. Quarterly revenues from ancillary operations are presently projected at $60.60 million, ahead of the $56.43 million registered in the comparable period last year.PSA’s activities during the quarter under review were adequate to gain analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first-quarter core FFO per share has been revised 1.5% upward to $4.07 in the past two months. It also calls for 11.5% year-over-year growth.However, with the impact of the pandemic abating, vacancy is likely to increase. Furthermore, there is a development boom of self-storage units in several markets. This high supply is likely to have fueled competition. Rising interest rates add to its woes.Story continuesHere Is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively predict a surprise in terms of FFO per share for Public Storage this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an FFO beat, which is not the case here.PSA currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

In fact, its analyst, Julie Utterback sees fair value at just $830, which would represent a massive downside from today’s $1,500 price.Church &amp; Dwight (CHD)sell written on a chalkboard representing overvalued stocks to sellSource: ShutterstockA lot of investors have been nervous about valuations in the consumer staples space. Over the past year, these companies have raised prices dramatically to benefit from the current inflationary wave. That has made for a beneficial effect on profits at these companies, and investors have bid many of them up to historically high valuations. However, there is danger in extrapolating this sort of profit growth forever.Church &amp; Dwight (NYSE:CHD) is one such example. The firm makes a wide variety of consumer goods such as baking powder, condoms, pregnancy tests, and air fresheners.These are all fine products that should have a fairly steady demand. But there are limits to growth in these sorts of categories. Church &amp; Dwight has only grown revenues at 6% per year annualized over the past decade, and yet shares are now selling for more than 32 times forward earnings. That’s quite expensive.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Based on this payment, the dividend yield on the company's stock will be 5.0%, which is an attractive boost to shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for Seagate Technology Holdings Seagate Technology Holdings' Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsImpressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. The company is paying out a large amount of its cash flows, even though it isn't generating any profit. This is quite a strong warning sign that the dividend may not be sustainable.The next 12 months could see EPS growing very rapidly. Assuming the dividend continues along the path it has been on, the payout ratio could get to 94% which is certainly still sustainable.historic-dividendSeagate Technology Holdings Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $1.28 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $2.80. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 8.1% a year over that time. The growth of the dividend has been pretty reliable, so we think this can offer investors some nice additional income in their portfolio.The Dividend's Growth Prospects Are LimitedInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. However, things aren't all that rosy. Although it's important to note that Seagate Technology Holdings' earnings per share has basically not grown from where it was five years ago, which could erode the purchasing power of the dividend over time.The Dividend Could Prove To Be UnreliableOverall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable. Although they have been consistent in the past, we think the payments are a little high to be sustained. We would probably look elsewhere for an income investment.Story continuesIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read Top 5 High Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Analysts. Dividend stocks have been on investors’ radars for quite some time now because of their ability to generate stable and regular income, lower risk, and tax advantages. Companies in the US also registered investors’ inclination toward dividend equities and steadily boosted their payouts over the years. According to a report by McKinsey &amp; Company, US companies returned 78% of their net income on average in dividends and share repurchases between 1995 and 2021, up from 60% on average between 1965 to 2008. This has boosted investors’ confidence, who are increasingly loading up on dividend stocks, especially during periods of market downturns.High inflationary periods have previously been beneficial for dividend equities because they have the potential to offer higher yields. This is more appealing for investors seeking income that can keep up with inflation. In our article titled 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we reported that dividends accounted for 54% of the market’s returns during decades of high inflation. The report also mentioned that during the 1940s, 1960s, and 1970s, dividends represented 67%, 44%, and 73% of the market’s returns, respectively. During these decades, inflation averaged above 5% with total returns averaging below 10%.When investing in dividend stocks, investors also pay attention to dividend yields as they indicate the amount of income an investor can expect to receive from a dividend-paying stock concerning its price. High dividend-yielding stocks are often considered risky investments because they signal financial distress or underlying problems within a company. However, overall financial health and a solid balance sheet of the respective company can mitigate the risks associated with high yields. Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO), Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), and British American Tobacco p.l.c. (NYSE:BTI) have above-average dividend yields but also have strong dividend histories. For safe investment purposes, investors should focus on dividend growth streaks along with dividend yields.Story continuesThe S&amp;P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats, which tracks the performance of companies with over 20 years of consistent dividend growth and has an average dividend yield of 3.5%, delivered a total return of 590.3% from December 1999 to June 2019, compared with a 215.2% return of the S&amp;P Composite 1500, Insider Monkey reported.Top 20 High Dividend Stocks To Buy According To AnalystsPhoto by Ruben Sukatendel on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we used the Finviz stock screener to identify dividend stocks with yields above 6%, as of May 4.

The company's cash position remained strong in the first quarter of 2023 as it generated nearly $200 million in operating cash flow. It is among the best dividend stocks on our list.Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO), Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), and British American Tobacco p.l.c. (NYSE:BTI) are some other best dividend stocks with high yields to consider.At the end of Q4 2022, 17 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned stakes in Camping World Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CWH), down from 22 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a collective value of over $171.8 million. With over 5 million shares, Abrams Capital Management was the company's leading stakeholder in Q4.19. Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)Upside Potential as of May 4: 21.3% Average Price Target Based on Analyst Ratings: $114.3 Dividend Yield as of May 4: 5.39%Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is an American multinational tobacco company that sells its products around the world. The company currently offers a quarterly dividend of $1.27 per share for a dividend yield of 5.39%, as of May 5. It is one of the best dividend stocks on our list as it has raised its dividends consistently for the past 14 years.Stifel initiated its coverage on Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) in April with a Buy rating and a $114 price target, calling the company one of the top ideas in the space. The firm also believes that the company offers superior growth potential.As of the close of Q4 2022, 47 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database owned stakes in Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), worth over $6.2 billion collectively.Artisan Partners mentioned Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Our top individual contributors were Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), EOG Resources and Merck. Despite being US-based, tobacco company PM derives all its sales from outside the US. As a result, foreign exchange impacts can be an important driver of near-term returns, and the recent weakening in the US dollar should provide a strong tailwind for earnings due to translation effects. However, our investment case is not tied to currency movements. By virtue of its globally known brands, PM is the best-in-class operator with a well-diversified business, particularly by geography. We believe its next generation heat-not-burn product IQOS should gain share as consumers continue migrating to safer tobacco delivery systems. The company is progressing toward its acquisition of Swedish Match, a Swedish tobacco and nicotine products maker, which was previously held in the portfolio. The deal is a good fit for PM as it reduces PM’s dependence on cigarettes—a category in steady decline—and accelerates the company’s transition to smokeless “reduced-risk” products (RRPs)—a category that has experienced rapid growth over the past five years. PM can also leverage its global scale to generate significant revenue synergies from these complementary product sets, as well as quickly gain access to the US market—the world’s largest market for RRPs and one where regulators have embraced RRPs and other less harmful nicotine products. Looking at PM through our margin-of-safety criteria, the business trades for an undemanding valuation and has extraordinary business economics and a strong credit profile.”18. Coterra Energy Inc.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Also on the detractor side, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) delivered a disappointing revenue miss and lowered full-year revenue and earnings guidance as COVID-19-driven demand for PCs abated (where Intel enjoys half its sales) and a delay in its flagship Sapphire Rapids CPU hurt its data center business. Despite these issues, we still believe Intel is an economically sensitive turnaround story with substantial upside.”17. Kinder Morgan, Inc.

Here is what the firm has to say:“U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) shares are ensnared in the bank-run panic that began late in the quarter. Two large banks failed in early March as depositors rushed to withdraw money on concerns that the banks would suffer from liquidity problems. That’s a self-fulfilling prophecy, of course, but in the case of the two banks, it was prompted by the revelations of utter mismanagement of their securities portfolio. Bank models are, essentially, to borrow short and lend long. This sounds dangerous of course, and it would be if not for the deposit guarantee provided by the FDIC. The history of the U.S. banking system can be divided into two eras – pre-FDIC, when bank runs were fairly common, and post-FDIC, when bank runs have been close to non-existent. However, FDIC protection has its limits, and it remains incumbent on management to properly manage its assets and liabilities. The two banks in question didn’t do that. By taking down the share prices of all banks, we think investors are shooting first and asking questions later; they are not distinguishing between the strong and the weak.U.S. Bancorp, as one of the largest and best-managed banks in the country, appears to be a net beneficiary so far of the panic among some depositors, with a pick-up in net deposit inflows in recent weeks. We don’t dismiss the probability of industry contagion – in a true nationwide panic, the big banks will suffer along with the small banks, and the well-managed ones will suffer along with the badly-managed ones. But we think the odds of that are quite small, and recent steps by federal regulators confirm that they will do everything in their power to prevent such a scenario, given the calamitous impact that it would have on our economy. We tightly manage this risk by limiting our exposure to the banking sector.”6. Telephone and Data Systems, Inc.

But if you buy good businesses at attractive prices, your portfolio returns could exceed the average market return. Just take a look at United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS), which is up 85%, over three years, soundly beating the market return of 37% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the returns haven't been quite so good recently, with shareholders up just 1.1% , including dividends .So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 3 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for United Parcel Service To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.United Parcel Service was able to grow its EPS at 36% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. The average annual share price increase of 23% is actually lower than the EPS growth. Therefore, it seems the market has moderated its expectations for growth, somewhat.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that United Parcel Service has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? This free interactive report on United Parcel Service's balance sheet strength is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for United Parcel Service the TSR over the last 3 years was 102%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that United Parcel Service shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 1.1% over the last year. That's including the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 12% a year, is even better. Potential buyers might understandably feel they've missed the opportunity, but it's always possible business is still firing on all cylinders. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for United Parcel Service   you should know about.But note: United Parcel Service may not be the best stock to buy.

During the wide-ranging Q&amp;A sessions, Buffett, the company’s CEO and Chairman, and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger answered questions from shareholders about the overall health of the economy, inflation, the regional bank crisis and artificial intelligence.The annual shareholders meeting took place just days after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 0.25% to a new 16-year high above 5% .Yahoo Finance’s Brian Sozzi and Myles Udland provide an overview and key takeaways from Saturday’s event.Key Moments:00:02:43 breakdown of Buffett’s comments on banking00:04:00 analyzing what Buffett and Munger said on AI00:05:54 what Buffett and Munger said about “value investing”Video Transcript[MUSIC PLAYING]BRIAN SOZZI: Welcome to Yahoo Finance's special coverage of the 2023 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting, known as the Woodstock of capitalism. And it's among the biggest events of the year for investors. We'll hear from legendary investor and Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett, along with his Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, as they give us their unique take on what's been a complicated year for the markets.A banking crisis, a slowing economy, geopolitical tensions, accelerated digital transformation with AI and a lot more, it's all on the agenda today. We're breaking down the big news from today's meeting and what's happening to the markets and your money.Brian Sozzi of Yahoo Finance here with Yahoo Finance's head of news, Myles Udland. And Myles and I, along with all of these people, are streaming out of the CHI Health Center in Omaha, Nebraska, have been ingesting hours and hours of Warren Buffett's insights into the economy and stocks alongside his right-hand man, Vice Chair Charlie Munger. And of course, we have a lot of takeaways.But let's start with three from this really celebration of capitalism, as those Berkshire shareholders love to call it. First off, the big banks, everybody in this room was waiting, Myles, to hear from Buffett on his views on the banks. Of course, First Republic now owned by JP Morgan, Buffett really not disappointing. Out of all the bank stocks that he talked about and the sector itself, he said he liked Bank of America, which he owns 13% of.Story continuesMYLES UDLAND: Yeah, well, so he came through his prepared remarks, which he said will be brief. They ran about 18 minutes, which I guess for Buffett--BRIAN SOZZI: That's brief.MYLES UDLAND: --counts as brief. And we kind of got right into it with the regional banks. And really the question was, what would have happened had the deposits of Silicon Valley Bank not been insured, and ultimately Buffett going with what I think most people would have expected him to say, where he said it would have been catastrophic.And I think, you know, Sozzi, it brings me back to that weekend where the bank is seized by regulators Friday morning. And everyone's thinking what's going to happen over the weekend. Ultimately FDIC comes out. They say we're going to backstop these.And throughout the proceedings there were a couple of questions in this direction. And I think Buffett's takeaway is that effectively all deposits in the US are now backstopped.BRIAN SOZZI: That's good.MYLES UDLAND: Whether they say that or not.BRIAN SOZZI: That's good. And that, of course, as well, Myles, as well, but come Monday morning's open for the market--MYLES UDLAND: Yeah.BRIAN SOZZI: I didn't get the sense that Buffett signaled to the world, go out and buy bank stocks. He sounded like many other people are, yeah, they might do this. They might do that. But I didn't hear that same tone compared to what I heard from Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup, a couple of days at Milken, where she said things are stable. I just didn't get that vibe.MYLES UDLAND: Yeah, I mean, we'll get to it in a little bit with his comments on Bank of America in more detail. But he did say that if you are an investor in banks right now or a prospective investor, I think he said, if you're a bank shareholder to use his phrase exactly, kind of hard to know what you buy, or what you're owning I guess in that situation. And a lot of it for him has to go with what are deposits.And he mentioned how sticky are deposits now, because did the whole wind-up. You don't have to stand in line to take him out of a bank. You can just go on your phone and pull your money. Obviously a dynamic that we saw with the Fed's report and the FDIC's report a couple of weeks ago is what happened at Silicon Valley Bank.What has been happening in the sector is people are wondering who is next. But really I think from Buffett's view, there's just a perception right now that you do not know for sure for sure what the business of a bank exactly looks like.BRIAN SOZZI: And, you know, you mentioned Bank of America, Myles, and you're a student of Warren Buffett and this meeting, been coming to it for many years. I can't say I'm surprised that he called out Bank of America. Of course he owns 13% of it. But under CEO Brian Moynihan, they aren't necessarily out there taking these crazy risks that a lot of these other regional banks are. So a different company, but again, Buffett, being Buffett, suggesting that Bank of America is doing something right in this climate.MYLES UDLAND: Yeah, and ultimately I think his takeaway was, well, I bought the thing back in 2011. He puts a bunch of capital in it. And I guess I'm going to see that through 12 years later.BRIAN SOZZI: Yep, absolutely. All right, well, outside the bank, of course, another takeaway we have is AI. So everybody was focused on what Buffett and Munger had to say on banks, but also artificial intelligence. And again, I'm going back. I'm thinking through the stock action on Monday. I just don't think these AI stocks, which have been really hot, come out blasting off of what Warren Buffett said out of the gate here.MYLES UDLAND: I mean sure, if you're trying to play the AI stocks--BRIAN SOZZI: I'm trying to, I'm trying.MYLES UDLAND: Based on what Warren Buffett is going to do, I mean, I don't really know if I can help you with that. But I think that the AI interaction there, and that was, I think, question two, three, four. It was right up there on the proceedings. It really got us our first great Mungerism of the day, when you're talking about what's the power of AI, this, that, and the other. And of course Charlie hits us with, well, I think old fashioned intelligence works just fine. We don't need the artificial stuff.BRIAN SOZZI: There's nothing wrong with that.MYLES UDLAND: The good old fashioned intelligence is just fine in his view.BRIAN SOZZI: But it is interesting that they view AI, they first went to BYD robots. Of course BYD is that electric car company. That's their first interpretation of what AI is, not Microsoft.MYLES UDLAND: Yeah.BRIAN SOZZI: Buffett and that Bill Gates relationship, not what they're doing, robots making cars.MYLES UDLAND: And I think that the reason that people come to this event, and the reason that Warren and Charlie have an audience, is because they are representative in a lot of ways of the median investor's view on this. And sure, you talked a lot of people who get really excited about language learning models and all these kinds of AGI, right? It's not just AI. It's artificial general intelligence.And they're just like, I mean, we have robots, you know. Robots are fine. And also in this section, too, I think it's the first time of many times where we got to what if he references to nuclear weapons.BRIAN SOZZI: Yes.MYLES UDLAND: And the technology--BRIAN SOZZI: Which he always does, which he does in the past.MYLES UDLAND: Is a regular feature of these. But I think that the risk of-- like the nuclear risk to Buffett is sort of the go to zero risk. And obviously in the '60s, very formative time in his career, and it's something that he brings up quite a bit.BRIAN SOZZI: So bottom line with that takeaway, folks, is if you were looking for Warren Buffett to pitch shares of C3AI, not going to happen. Next take away, of course, value investing. That's why a lot of people that I've talked to at this event, that's why they come here, to get a sense of what Warren Buffett sees in terms of value. And it was interesting what he said on value investing, Myles.MYLES UDLAND: Yeah, and, you know, I think this is where we saw the biggest distance between Warren and Charlie. Charlie Munger, very pessimistic on it, he said, I just think it's going to be worse in the future. And Buffett coming back and saying, well, you know, Charlie, you always say that.And I think that to use Munger's exact quote, my advice to value investors is get used to making less money. And you see the folks kind of behind us here certainly this morning teeming into the building, you know, people in sport coats and khakis, value types. I overheard quite a few conversations on my way in to that effect.And they weren't just trying to give some encouragement to the crowd. And this is where we kind of got to a Warren zinger, perhaps, where your biggest opportunity as an investor, value or otherwise, is other people doing dumb things.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, a lot of folks mistaking me for a hedge fund manager at this event. I also point out--MYLES UDLAND: Well, you're dressed like one.BRIAN SOZZI: I know.MYLES UDLAND: I'm dressed like a normal person. You're dressed like a hedge fund manager.BRIAN SOZZI: I know. Well, I also, on value investing, I caught up with Whitney Tilson, longtime Buffett follower and friend of our shows. He said based on his models, he said this after the event, he calculates that Berkshire is trading at a 13% discount to intrinsic value. So if value investing is really dead, what do you do with Berkshire stock if it is that undervalued?MYLES UDLAND: Yeah, well, what did Warren say? $504 billion on a GAAP basis is what the stock is worth? And you kind of, or I think it's $504,000 per share. You do the quick and dirty math on that, divided by the 1,500, you get 333 for B shares, and I think they closed around 320 on Friday.BRIAN SOZZI: All right.MYLES UDLAND: So, I mean, Whitney always-- I've been in many presentations at this event with Whitney telling me that I should be buying Berkshire Hathaway. So I don't think you're going to get a different answer from him at other points in time.BRIAN SOZZI: Fair enough. All right, of course, we have a rapid-fire section for you as well, hitting a lot of these favorite Yahoo Finance tickers. First off Apple, of course, Apple is a key holder, a key holding inside of Berkshire Hathaway. And Myles, naturally, it took a little while to get that Apple question. But it was interesting how it was posed to him.MYLES UDLAND: It did, and we kind of got to it in two ways. I think what'll draw the headlines is Buffett saying, you know, I don't understand the product at all, or I don't understand the phone. But I understand the business. He understands the business of selling phones, not necessarily how one makes a phone.But that also got into really what I think Apple has become the most instructive holding within Berkshire's portfolio. They pay a huge dividend. So every quarter, they're getting hundreds of millions-- they're getting $100 million check, or it's not, it's much larger than that. But nine figure check coming to Berkshire Hathaway.Second thing, they buy back a lot of stock. So Berkshire's holdings in Apple, its percentage of the company that it owns, has gone up organically over time. We saw the announcement on Thursday night from Apple increasing the size of that buyback authorization.So it's going to continue to go up. And it led to this discussion of how much Apple do you really own. And you look at the equity portfolio, it's out 40%. And Buffett was like, it's not 40%. We own a bunch of other stuff, See's Candies, Garanimals, got tons of runs in a kid's clothing brand. Tons of run today. But basically being like we're not 35% Apple, because our equity holdings are only a small chunk of the whole Berkshire family.BRIAN SOZZI: You look at Apple and you have to think, is this the new Coca-Cola for this generation in terms of an investment for Warren Buffett. Is this Warren Buffett connecting with that next generation of investors?MYLES UDLAND: I mean, I think, look, you can kind of say, and Buffett would probably say this, doesn't really matter what the product is. They have a dominant position in the market. They make a ton of money. They return a bunch of that money to shareholders.So whether you're selling Coca-Cola or you're selling iPhones, it hits all those criteria. And whatever generation you want to call any company, any company coming from, Buffett's going to like those characteristics.BRIAN SOZZI: Next up rapid-fire session here, Paramount. Of course, on Friday the stock got absolutely slaughtered, slashing its dividend, bad quarter, lots of losses. And one thing that stuck with me from that quarter from Paramount, Myles, when I talked to Amex's CEO, Stephen Squeri, that story is on our homepage now. He says do not surprise Warren Buffett.To me he sounded surprised this event. He did not come out and say, you know, Bob Bakish is a phenomenal manager. Of course that's the CEO of Paramount. He didn't do it. He didn't do it.MYLES UDLAND: Well, we just talked about how Warren Buffett likes companies that return a lot of capital to shareholders. What did Paramount come out and do on Thursday? They cut their dividend. And Buffett says never good when a company announces a material cut to their dividend.You're trying to shore up your capital position. You can't give it back to your owners basically. So I'll be interested to see what happens with that position. It kind of is a small part of the Berkshire equity portfolio, kind of came up-- I won't say out of nowhere, he has a long history investing in the media business, but all of a sudden it's a bunch of Paramount. Now he owns 93 million shares of the company.And so we get into the conversation about the streaming wars. And I thought his comments on your eyeballs were quite hilarious.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, eyeballs matter, but in that--MYLES UDLAND: He goes everyone loves to use their eyes.BRIAN SOZZI: No, yes, and that's key, he's clearly bullish eyes. But in that context, there's a lot of competition for our eyeballs, which is why I think that stake in Paramount disclosed in November last year raised a lot of eyebrows, because it wasn't really Warren Buffetty.MYLES UDLAND: I think everyone thinks the same thing, and, you know, look, the 13F will come out, I guess what, middle of next week, what they did or didn't do in the first quarter. So I think some questions there with that position.BRIAN SOZZI: We're keeping it moving here, Taiwan Semiconductor, a position that Buffett took, what was it, late last year. And then he exited very quickly, not a very Warren Buffett type of move. But he did heap a lot of praise on that company.MYLES UDLAND: Yeah, I mean, I'll kick this one right back to you, because you wrote up a quick story for us on this one. He heaped a lot of praise on it. And he kind of had a weird-- I don't know, I couldn't make sense of exactly what the point was on not wanting exposure to Taiwan, but saying US-China relations might be fine. Everyone has blame. I couldn't quite sort that one out.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, and if you're an Intel and you're a lot of these other chip-makers, to not hear Warren Buffett say you're doing cool stuff, not exactly a great thing. Lastly, Occidental Petroleum. Of course, a lot of investors, Warren Buffett built its position or his position in Occidental Petroleum under the potential, maybe goes out and just buys the darn company. But Warren said, eh-eh, unlikely to happen.MYLES UDLAND: He was very blunt. We are not going to make a play to take control of the company. They have approval to buy up to 50% of the outstanding shares. I think they own about 25% today. But, yeah, there was an analyst that talked to our RNS friend Josh Schafer last week who surmised maybe Vicki Hollub, CEO, would come in and run Berkshire Hathaway Energy when Greg Abel moves on. I mean, maybe that could happen.BRIAN SOZZI: Ooh, that's good.MYLES UDLAND: Yeah, it was a good one in the story. But Buffett kind of squashing that today.BRIAN SOZZI: And then final takeaways, Myles, to you. You first.MYLES UDLAND: Really crowded, man, this place is crowded. This place yesterday, extremely stressful going in the Convention Hall.BRIAN SOZZI: For me, two takeaways, one amazing to see Warren Buffett, 92 years old, Charlie Munger 99 years old, answering all these questions in top form. I'm just fascinated by the whole thing. And the next, last but not least, on Monday, the ""Morning Brief"" newsletter, please do check that out, subscribe, whatever. We're looking into the succession battle, or not battle, or succession plan here for Warren Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway. Lots of interesting nuggets that our team pulled here from the event.But that's it for yours truly and Myles Udland. And we're going to get back and get some air conditioning. It's a little warm here in Omaha, Nebraska. We'll see you guys later.]"

""You don't want to be a no-emotion person in all of your life, but you definitely want to be a no-emotion person when making an investment or business decision.""Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, talks to a reporter in the exhibit hall at the company's annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, U.S., May 5, 2018. REUTERS/Rick Wilking (Rick Wilking / Reuters)That strategy has worked for Berkshire Hathaway over the years. The conglomerate has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 from 1965 to 2022 and weathered all kinds of ups and downs in the economy.Buffett is known for his signature value-oriented investment philosophy, which consists of buying and holding a core set of quality companies over long periods of time. Berkshire's biggest holdings consist of Bank of America (BAC), Apple (AAPL), Coca-Cola (KO), and American Express (AXP).""It all comes down to the business,"" fellow value investor Jonathan Boyar told Yahoo Finance Live about the investing approach. ""Is it a good business? Do they have a product or a service that people want? And can it grow? Is there a large total addressable market? And then it comes down to valuation.

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for American Express The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At American ExpressThe insider, Monique Herena, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$2.6m worth of shares at a price of US$173 each. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$153). So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.Over the last year we saw more insider selling of American Express shares, than buying. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At American Express Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at American Express. In total, insiders sold US$9.9m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Does American Express Boast High Insider Ownership?I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. American Express insiders own about US$154m worth of shares (which is 0.1% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At American Express Tell Us?Insiders haven't bought American Express stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing American Express.

The legendary investor was joined by Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A) Vice Chairman Charlie Munger.When asked about his investment in Apple (AAPL), Buffett said, “I don't understand the phone at all, but I do understand consumer behavior.""“Apple is not 35% of Berkshire's portfolio… it just happens to be a better business than any business we own.”He later made comments about his strategy in the energy sector, telling Berkshire shareholders the holding company is not ""going to be making an offer for control of Occidental [Petroleum].”Find more special coverage of the 2023 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting on YahooFinance.com.Video TranscriptBRIAN SOZZI: Of course, we have a rapid-fire section for you as well, hitting a lot of these favorite Yahoo Finance tickers. First off, Apple, of course, Apple is a key holding inside of Berkshire Hathaway. And Myles, naturally, it took a little while to get that Apple question. But it was interesting how it was posed to them.MYLES UDLAND: It did. And we kind of got to it in two ways. I think what will draw the headlines is Buffett saying, I don't understand the product at all, or I don't understand the phone, but I understand the business. He understands the business of selling phones not necessarily how one makes a phone.But that also got into really what I think-- Apple has become the most instructive holding within Berkshire's portfolio. They pay a huge dividend. So every quarter, they're getting hundreds of-- they're getting $100 million check, or it's not-- it's much larger than that. But nine-figure check coming to Berkshire Hathaway.Second thing, they buy back a lot of stock. So Berkshire's holdings in Apple, its percentage of the company that it owns, has gone up organically over time. We saw the announcement on Thursday night from Apple increasing the size of that buyback authorization. So it's going to continue to go up.Story continuesAnd it led to this discussion of how much Apple do you really own? And you look at the equity portfolio. It's about 40%. And Buffett was like, it's not 40%. We own a bunch of other stuff, See's Candies. Garanimals got tons of runs today, kids clothing brand, tons of run today.But basically being like we're not 35% Apple because our equity holdings are only a small chunk of the whole Berkshire family.BRIAN SOZZI: You look at Apple. And you have to think, is this the new Coca-Cola for this generation in terms of an investment for Warren Buffett? Is this Warren Buffett connecting with that next generation of investors?MYLES UDLAND: I mean, I think look, you can kind of say-- and Buffett would probably say this. It doesn't really matter what the product is. They have a dominant position in the market. They make a ton of money. They return a bunch of that money to shareholders. So whether you're selling Coca-Cola or you're selling iPhones, it hits all those criteria.And whatever generation you want to call any company coming from, Buffett's going to like those characteristics.BRIAN SOZZI: Next up, rapid fire session here. Paramount, of course, on Friday, the stock got absolutely slaughtered, slashing its dividend, bad quarter, lots of losses. And one thing that stuck with me from that quarter from Paramount, Myles, when I talk to AmEx's CEO Steven Squeri-- that story is on our home page now. He says, do not surprise Warren Buffett.To me, he sounded surprised at this event. He did not come out and say, Bob Bakish is a phenomenal manager. Of course, that's the CEO of Paramount. He didn't do it. He didn't do it.MYLES UDLAND: Well, we just talked about how Warren Buffett likes companies that return a lot of capital to shareholders. What did Paramount come out and do on Thursday? They cut their dividend. And Buffett says, never good when a company announces a material cut to their dividend. You're trying to shore up your capital position when you can't give it back to your owners basically.So I'll be interested to see what happens with that position. It kind of-- it's a small part of the Berkshire equity portfolio. It kind of came up-- I don't want to say out of nowhere. He has a long history of investing in the media business. But all of a sudden, it's like, oh, Buffett owns a bunch of Paramount. Now he owns 93 million shares of the company.And so we get into the conversation about the streaming wars. And I thought his comments on your eyeballs were quite hilarious.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, eyeballs matter. But in that--MYLES UDLAND: He goes, everyone loves to use their eyes.BRIAN SOZZI: No, yes. It's key. He's clearly bullish eyes. But in that context, there's a lot of competition for our eyeballs, which is why I think that stake in Paramount, disclosed in November last year, raised a lot of eyebrows because it wasn't really Warren Buffetty.MYLES UDLAND: I think everyone thinks the same thing. And look, the 13-F will come out, I guess, what, middle of next week, what they did or didn't do in the first quarter. So I think some questions there with that position.BRIAN SOZZI: We're keeping moving here, Taiwan Semiconductor a position that Buffett took-- what was it, late last year? And then he exited it very quickly, not a very Warren Buffett type of move. But he did hear a lot of praise on that company.MYLES UDLAND: Yeah, I mean, I'll kick this one right back to you because you wrote up a quick story for us on this one. He heaped a lot of praise on it. And he kind of had a-- I don't know. I couldn't make sense of exactly what the point was on not wanting exposure to Taiwan but saying US-China relations might be fine. Everyone has blame. I couldn't quite sort that one out.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah. And if you're an Intel and you're a lot of these other chip-makers, to not hear Warren Buffett say you're doing cool stuff, eh, not exactly a great thing.Lastly, Occidental Petroleum, of course, a lot of investors have been watching Warren Buffett build its position or his position in Occidental Petroleum under the potential, maybe he goes out and just buys the darn company. But Warren said, eh, eh, eh, unlikely to happen.MYLES UDLAND: He came-- he was very blunt. We were not going to make a play to take control of the company. They have approval to buy up to 50% of the outstanding shares. I think they own about 25% today. But yeah, there was an analyst that talked to our Ines Ferre and Josh Shafer last week who surmised maybe Vicki Hollub, CEO, would come in and run Berkshire Hathaway Energy when Greg Abel moves on. I mean, maybe that could happen.BRIAN SOZZI: Ooh, that's good.MYLES UDLAND: Yeah, it was a good one in the story. But Buffett kind of squashing that today.BRIAN SOZZI: And then final takeaways. Myles, to you first.MYLES UDLAND: Really crowded. Man, this place is crowded. Yesterday, extremely stressful going in the convention hall.BRIAN SOZZI: For me, two takeaways. One, amazing to see Warren Buffett, 92 years old, Charlie Munger, 99 old, answering all these questions, in top form. I'm just fascinated by the whole thing. And the next, last but not least, on Monday, ""the Morning Brief"" newsletter, please do check that out, subscribe, whatever. We're looking into the succession battle-- not battle, succession plan here for Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway, lots of interesting little nuggets that our team pulled here from the event.But that's it for yours truly and Myles Udland. We're going to get back and get some air conditioning. It's a little warm here in Omaha, Nebraska. We'll see you guys later.]"

""We have got the right management.""Occidental did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Analysts and investors have said an acquisition could diversify Berkshire's energy portfolio, which includes several utilities, electricity distributors and renewable power projects.Berkshire started amassing shares of Houston-based Occidental in February 2022, around when Russia invaded Ukraine.Buffett has also had a close relationship with Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub, who has been slashing debt and returning money to shareholders since the company bought Anadarko Petroleum Corp in 2019.""Hollub is an extraordinary manager at Occidental,"" Buffett said. ""We love having Vicki run it.""Occidental and Chevron Corp, another large Berkshire holding, also have significant presences in the Permian Basin, an area in Texas and New Mexico that accounts for a significant amount of U.S. crude production.Berkshire ended March owning $21.6 billion of Chevron stock, though it appeared to sell about $6 billion in the first quarter, Edward Jones &amp; Co analyst Jim Shanahan estimated.Until recently, Berkshire also owned $10 billion of Occidental preferred stock with an 8% dividend, which helped fund the Anadarko purchase, plus warrants to buy another $5 billion of common shares at $59.62 each.Berkshire said on Saturday that Occidental redeemed about $474 million of the preferred stock at a premium, which it had a right to do, reducing dividend payouts.Story continuesLast August, Berkshire won U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission permission to buy up to 50% of Occidental's common stock.It needed the authorization because it would have had exceeded the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's 25% ownership limit had it exercised the warrants.Buffett, 92, has longed for another large acquisition for his Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate, whose dozens of businesses include Geico car insurance and the BNSF railroad.Berkshire had a 22.6% stake in BNSF before paying $26.5 billion for the remainder in 2010.(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in Omaha, Nebraska and Carolina Mandl in New York)]"

The stock is down 3.6% in 2023.The ties between Buffett and Occidental Petroleum go back to April 2019, when Berkshire Hathaway backed Occidental's proposed bid for Anadarko Petroleum with a $10 billion commitment. The deal was pivotal in the company winning its pursuit of Anadarko against Chevron's rival offer.Buffett's cash infusion gave Berkshire 100,000 preferred shares and the right to buy up to 80 million common shares of the company at $62.50. At the time, Occidental shares were trading just shy of $60.In this May 5, 2019, file photo, Warren Buffett, Chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, speaks during a game of bridge following the annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting in Omaha, Neb.

WTI crude oil (CL=F) and Brent crude (BZ=F) settled the week near $71.30 and $75.29 a barrel, respectively.

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Vertex Pharmaceuticals'  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for Vertex Pharmaceuticals How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Vertex Pharmaceuticals is:23% = US$3.3b ÷ US$14b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.23 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Vertex Pharmaceuticals' Earnings Growth And 23% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that Vertex Pharmaceuticals has a significantly high ROE. Further, even comparing with the industry average if 21%, the company's ROE is quite respectable. Therefore, it might not be wrong to say that the impressive five year 23% net income growth seen by Vertex Pharmaceuticals was probably achieved as a result of the high ROE.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Vertex Pharmaceuticals' reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 31% in the same period, which is not something we like to see.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is VRTX worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether VRTX is currently mispriced by the market.Is Vertex Pharmaceuticals Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Given that Vertex Pharmaceuticals doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that Vertex Pharmaceuticals' performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a respectable growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

During the wide-ranging Q&amp;A sessions, Buffett, the company’s CEO and Chairman, and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger answered questions from shareholders about the overall health of the economy, inflation, the regional bank crisis and artificial intelligence.The annual shareholders meeting took place just days after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 0.25% to a new 16-year high above 5% .Yahoo Finance’s Brian Sozzi and Myles Udland provide an overview and key takeaways from Saturday’s event.Key Moments:00:02:43 breakdown of Buffett’s comments on banking00:04:00 analyzing what Buffett and Munger said on AI00:05:54 what Buffett and Munger said about “value investing”Video Transcript[MUSIC PLAYING]BRIAN SOZZI: Welcome to Yahoo Finance's special coverage of the 2023 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting, known as the Woodstock of capitalism. And it's among the biggest events of the year for investors. We'll hear from legendary investor and Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett, along with his Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, as they give us their unique take on what's been a complicated year for the markets.A banking crisis, a slowing economy, geopolitical tensions, accelerated digital transformation with AI and a lot more, it's all on the agenda today. We're breaking down the big news from today's meeting and what's happening to the markets and your money.Brian Sozzi of Yahoo Finance here with Yahoo Finance's head of news, Myles Udland. And Myles and I, along with all of these people, are streaming out of the CHI Health Center in Omaha, Nebraska, have been ingesting hours and hours of Warren Buffett's insights into the economy and stocks alongside his right-hand man, Vice Chair Charlie Munger. And of course, we have a lot of takeaways.But let's start with three from this really celebration of capitalism, as those Berkshire shareholders love to call it. First off, the big banks, everybody in this room was waiting, Myles, to hear from Buffett on his views on the banks. Of course, First Republic now owned by JP Morgan, Buffett really not disappointing. Out of all the bank stocks that he talked about and the sector itself, he said he liked Bank of America, which he owns 13% of.Story continuesMYLES UDLAND: Yeah, well, so he came through his prepared remarks, which he said will be brief. They ran about 18 minutes, which I guess for Buffett--BRIAN SOZZI: That's brief.MYLES UDLAND: --counts as brief. And we kind of got right into it with the regional banks. And really the question was, what would have happened had the deposits of Silicon Valley Bank not been insured, and ultimately Buffett going with what I think most people would have expected him to say, where he said it would have been catastrophic.And I think, you know, Sozzi, it brings me back to that weekend where the bank is seized by regulators Friday morning. And everyone's thinking what's going to happen over the weekend. Ultimately FDIC comes out. They say we're going to backstop these.And throughout the proceedings there were a couple of questions in this direction. And I think Buffett's takeaway is that effectively all deposits in the US are now backstopped.BRIAN SOZZI: That's good.MYLES UDLAND: Whether they say that or not.BRIAN SOZZI: That's good. And that, of course, as well, Myles, as well, but come Monday morning's open for the market--MYLES UDLAND: Yeah.BRIAN SOZZI: I didn't get the sense that Buffett signaled to the world, go out and buy bank stocks. He sounded like many other people are, yeah, they might do this. They might do that. But I didn't hear that same tone compared to what I heard from Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup, a couple of days at Milken, where she said things are stable. I just didn't get that vibe.MYLES UDLAND: Yeah, I mean, we'll get to it in a little bit with his comments on Bank of America in more detail. But he did say that if you are an investor in banks right now or a prospective investor, I think he said, if you're a bank shareholder to use his phrase exactly, kind of hard to know what you buy, or what you're owning I guess in that situation. And a lot of it for him has to go with what are deposits.And he mentioned how sticky are deposits now, because did the whole wind-up. You don't have to stand in line to take him out of a bank. You can just go on your phone and pull your money. Obviously a dynamic that we saw with the Fed's report and the FDIC's report a couple of weeks ago is what happened at Silicon Valley Bank.What has been happening in the sector is people are wondering who is next. But really I think from Buffett's view, there's just a perception right now that you do not know for sure for sure what the business of a bank exactly looks like.BRIAN SOZZI: And, you know, you mentioned Bank of America, Myles, and you're a student of Warren Buffett and this meeting, been coming to it for many years. I can't say I'm surprised that he called out Bank of America. Of course he owns 13% of it. But under CEO Brian Moynihan, they aren't necessarily out there taking these crazy risks that a lot of these other regional banks are. So a different company, but again, Buffett, being Buffett, suggesting that Bank of America is doing something right in this climate.MYLES UDLAND: Yeah, and ultimately I think his takeaway was, well, I bought the thing back in 2011. He puts a bunch of capital in it. And I guess I'm going to see that through 12 years later.BRIAN SOZZI: Yep, absolutely. All right, well, outside the bank, of course, another takeaway we have is AI. So everybody was focused on what Buffett and Munger had to say on banks, but also artificial intelligence. And again, I'm going back. I'm thinking through the stock action on Monday. I just don't think these AI stocks, which have been really hot, come out blasting off of what Warren Buffett said out of the gate here.MYLES UDLAND: I mean sure, if you're trying to play the AI stocks--BRIAN SOZZI: I'm trying to, I'm trying.MYLES UDLAND: Based on what Warren Buffett is going to do, I mean, I don't really know if I can help you with that. But I think that the AI interaction there, and that was, I think, question two, three, four. It was right up there on the proceedings. It really got us our first great Mungerism of the day, when you're talking about what's the power of AI, this, that, and the other. And of course Charlie hits us with, well, I think old fashioned intelligence works just fine. We don't need the artificial stuff.BRIAN SOZZI: There's nothing wrong with that.MYLES UDLAND: The good old fashioned intelligence is just fine in his view.BRIAN SOZZI: But it is interesting that they view AI, they first went to BYD robots. Of course BYD is that electric car company. That's their first interpretation of what AI is, not Microsoft.MYLES UDLAND: Yeah.BRIAN SOZZI: Buffett and that Bill Gates relationship, not what they're doing, robots making cars.MYLES UDLAND: And I think that the reason that people come to this event, and the reason that Warren and Charlie have an audience, is because they are representative in a lot of ways of the median investor's view on this. And sure, you talked a lot of people who get really excited about language learning models and all these kinds of AGI, right? It's not just AI. It's artificial general intelligence.And they're just like, I mean, we have robots, you know. Robots are fine. And also in this section, too, I think it's the first time of many times where we got to what if he references to nuclear weapons.BRIAN SOZZI: Yes.MYLES UDLAND: And the technology--BRIAN SOZZI: Which he always does, which he does in the past.MYLES UDLAND: Is a regular feature of these. But I think that the risk of-- like the nuclear risk to Buffett is sort of the go to zero risk. And obviously in the '60s, very formative time in his career, and it's something that he brings up quite a bit.BRIAN SOZZI: So bottom line with that takeaway, folks, is if you were looking for Warren Buffett to pitch shares of C3AI, not going to happen. Next take away, of course, value investing. That's why a lot of people that I've talked to at this event, that's why they come here, to get a sense of what Warren Buffett sees in terms of value. And it was interesting what he said on value investing, Myles.MYLES UDLAND: Yeah, and, you know, I think this is where we saw the biggest distance between Warren and Charlie. Charlie Munger, very pessimistic on it, he said, I just think it's going to be worse in the future. And Buffett coming back and saying, well, you know, Charlie, you always say that.And I think that to use Munger's exact quote, my advice to value investors is get used to making less money. And you see the folks kind of behind us here certainly this morning teeming into the building, you know, people in sport coats and khakis, value types. I overheard quite a few conversations on my way in to that effect.And they weren't just trying to give some encouragement to the crowd. And this is where we kind of got to a Warren zinger, perhaps, where your biggest opportunity as an investor, value or otherwise, is other people doing dumb things.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, a lot of folks mistaking me for a hedge fund manager at this event. I also point out--MYLES UDLAND: Well, you're dressed like one.BRIAN SOZZI: I know.MYLES UDLAND: I'm dressed like a normal person. You're dressed like a hedge fund manager.BRIAN SOZZI: I know. Well, I also, on value investing, I caught up with Whitney Tilson, longtime Buffett follower and friend of our shows. He said based on his models, he said this after the event, he calculates that Berkshire is trading at a 13% discount to intrinsic value. So if value investing is really dead, what do you do with Berkshire stock if it is that undervalued?MYLES UDLAND: Yeah, well, what did Warren say? $504 billion on a GAAP basis is what the stock is worth? And you kind of, or I think it's $504,000 per share. You do the quick and dirty math on that, divided by the 1,500, you get 333 for B shares, and I think they closed around 320 on Friday.BRIAN SOZZI: All right.MYLES UDLAND: So, I mean, Whitney always-- I've been in many presentations at this event with Whitney telling me that I should be buying Berkshire Hathaway. So I don't think you're going to get a different answer from him at other points in time.BRIAN SOZZI: Fair enough. All right, of course, we have a rapid-fire section for you as well, hitting a lot of these favorite Yahoo Finance tickers. First off Apple, of course, Apple is a key holder, a key holding inside of Berkshire Hathaway. And Myles, naturally, it took a little while to get that Apple question. But it was interesting how it was posed to him.MYLES UDLAND: It did, and we kind of got to it in two ways. I think what'll draw the headlines is Buffett saying, you know, I don't understand the product at all, or I don't understand the phone. But I understand the business. He understands the business of selling phones, not necessarily how one makes a phone.But that also got into really what I think Apple has become the most instructive holding within Berkshire's portfolio. They pay a huge dividend. So every quarter, they're getting hundreds of millions-- they're getting $100 million check, or it's not, it's much larger than that. But nine figure check coming to Berkshire Hathaway.Second thing, they buy back a lot of stock. So Berkshire's holdings in Apple, its percentage of the company that it owns, has gone up organically over time. We saw the announcement on Thursday night from Apple increasing the size of that buyback authorization.So it's going to continue to go up. And it led to this discussion of how much Apple do you really own. And you look at the equity portfolio, it's out 40%. And Buffett was like, it's not 40%. We own a bunch of other stuff, See's Candies, Garanimals, got tons of runs in a kid's clothing brand. Tons of run today. But basically being like we're not 35% Apple, because our equity holdings are only a small chunk of the whole Berkshire family.BRIAN SOZZI: You look at Apple and you have to think, is this the new Coca-Cola for this generation in terms of an investment for Warren Buffett. Is this Warren Buffett connecting with that next generation of investors?MYLES UDLAND: I mean, I think, look, you can kind of say, and Buffett would probably say this, doesn't really matter what the product is. They have a dominant position in the market. They make a ton of money. They return a bunch of that money to shareholders.So whether you're selling Coca-Cola or you're selling iPhones, it hits all those criteria. And whatever generation you want to call any company, any company coming from, Buffett's going to like those characteristics.BRIAN SOZZI: Next up rapid-fire session here, Paramount. Of course, on Friday the stock got absolutely slaughtered, slashing its dividend, bad quarter, lots of losses. And one thing that stuck with me from that quarter from Paramount, Myles, when I talked to Amex's CEO, Stephen Squeri, that story is on our homepage now. He says do not surprise Warren Buffett.To me he sounded surprised this event. He did not come out and say, you know, Bob Bakish is a phenomenal manager. Of course that's the CEO of Paramount. He didn't do it. He didn't do it.MYLES UDLAND: Well, we just talked about how Warren Buffett likes companies that return a lot of capital to shareholders. What did Paramount come out and do on Thursday? They cut their dividend. And Buffett says never good when a company announces a material cut to their dividend.You're trying to shore up your capital position. You can't give it back to your owners basically. So I'll be interested to see what happens with that position. It kind of is a small part of the Berkshire equity portfolio, kind of came up-- I won't say out of nowhere, he has a long history investing in the media business, but all of a sudden it's a bunch of Paramount. Now he owns 93 million shares of the company.And so we get into the conversation about the streaming wars. And I thought his comments on your eyeballs were quite hilarious.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, eyeballs matter, but in that--MYLES UDLAND: He goes everyone loves to use their eyes.BRIAN SOZZI: No, yes, and that's key, he's clearly bullish eyes. But in that context, there's a lot of competition for our eyeballs, which is why I think that stake in Paramount disclosed in November last year raised a lot of eyebrows, because it wasn't really Warren Buffetty.MYLES UDLAND: I think everyone thinks the same thing, and, you know, look, the 13F will come out, I guess what, middle of next week, what they did or didn't do in the first quarter. So I think some questions there with that position.BRIAN SOZZI: We're keeping it moving here, Taiwan Semiconductor, a position that Buffett took, what was it, late last year. And then he exited very quickly, not a very Warren Buffett type of move. But he did heap a lot of praise on that company.MYLES UDLAND: Yeah, I mean, I'll kick this one right back to you, because you wrote up a quick story for us on this one. He heaped a lot of praise on it. And he kind of had a weird-- I don't know, I couldn't make sense of exactly what the point was on not wanting exposure to Taiwan, but saying US-China relations might be fine. Everyone has blame. I couldn't quite sort that one out.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, and if you're an Intel and you're a lot of these other chip-makers, to not hear Warren Buffett say you're doing cool stuff, not exactly a great thing. Lastly, Occidental Petroleum. Of course, a lot of investors, Warren Buffett built its position or his position in Occidental Petroleum under the potential, maybe goes out and just buys the darn company. But Warren said, eh-eh, unlikely to happen.MYLES UDLAND: He was very blunt. We are not going to make a play to take control of the company. They have approval to buy up to 50% of the outstanding shares. I think they own about 25% today. But, yeah, there was an analyst that talked to our RNS friend Josh Schafer last week who surmised maybe Vicki Hollub, CEO, would come in and run Berkshire Hathaway Energy when Greg Abel moves on. I mean, maybe that could happen.BRIAN SOZZI: Ooh, that's good.MYLES UDLAND: Yeah, it was a good one in the story. But Buffett kind of squashing that today.BRIAN SOZZI: And then final takeaways, Myles, to you. You first.MYLES UDLAND: Really crowded, man, this place is crowded. This place yesterday, extremely stressful going in the Convention Hall.BRIAN SOZZI: For me, two takeaways, one amazing to see Warren Buffett, 92 years old, Charlie Munger 99 years old, answering all these questions in top form. I'm just fascinated by the whole thing. And the next, last but not least, on Monday, the ""Morning Brief"" newsletter, please do check that out, subscribe, whatever. We're looking into the succession battle, or not battle, or succession plan here for Warren Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway. Lots of interesting nuggets that our team pulled here from the event.But that's it for yours truly and Myles Udland. And we're going to get back and get some air conditioning. It's a little warm here in Omaha, Nebraska. We'll see you guys later.]"

Sempra Energy has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 8.67%, on average.Factors to NoteIn the first quarter, some parts of Sempra Energy’s service territories witnessed warmer-than-normal temperatures accompanied by drought conditions in most regions. Such weather patterns are likely to have dampened the electricity demand for heating purposes among the company’s customers in winter. This is expected to have negatively impacted revenues in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.However, some parts of its service territories experienced cooler-than-normal temperatures, which might have increased the electricity demand for heating purposes among SRE’s customers. This is likely to have benefited the company’s overall first-quarter revenues.Meanwhile, mounting transmission interconnection requests in Oncor are likely to have benefited Sempra Energy’s first-quarter revenues.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $4.03 billion. This indicates a 5.5% increase from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.From the cost perspective, the heavy snowfall might have caused infrastructural damage for Sempra Energy, thereby increasing the company’s operating expenses to repair the damage. This might have hurt the first-quarter bottom line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at $2.76 per share.

So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. We can see that General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) does use debt in its business. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?When Is Debt Dangerous?Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together. View our latest analysis for General Electric What Is General Electric's Net Debt?You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that General Electric had US$22.4b of debt in March 2023, down from US$33.6b, one year before. However, it also had US$22.4b in cash, and so its net debt is US$6.00m.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At General Electric's LiabilitiesWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that General Electric had liabilities of US$48.2b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$83.5b due beyond that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$22.4b as well as receivables valued at US$16.2b due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$93.0b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.This is a mountain of leverage even relative to its gargantuan market capitalization of US$109.2b. Should its lenders demand that it shore up the balance sheet, shareholders would likely face severe dilution. Carrying virtually no net debt, General Electric has a very light debt load indeed.Story continuesWe measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).With net debt at just 0.00069 times EBITDA, it seems General Electric only uses a little bit of leverage. But EBIT was only 6.3 times the interest expense last year, so the borrowing is clearly weighing on the business somewhat. Even more impressive was the fact that General Electric grew its EBIT by 138% over twelve months. If maintained that growth will make the debt even more manageable in the years ahead. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine General Electric's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. Over the last two years, General Electric recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 97% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect. That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt.Our ViewThe good news is that General Electric's demonstrated ability to convert EBIT to free cash flow delights us like a fluffy puppy does a toddler. But, on a more sombre note, we are a little concerned by its level of total liabilities. Taking all this data into account, it seems to us that General Electric takes a pretty sensible approach to debt. While that brings some risk, it can also enhance returns for shareholders. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Case in point: We've spotted   2 warning signs for General Electric  you should be aware of.Of course, if you're the type of investor who prefers buying stocks without the burden of debt, then don't hesitate to discover our exclusive list of net cash growth stocks, today.Have feedback on this article?

This makes the dividend yield about the same as the industry average at 2.5%. Check out our latest analysis for Aflac Aflac's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWhile it is always good to see a solid dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is feasible. However, prior to this announcement, Aflac's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to fall by 7.5% over the next year. If the dividend continues along the path it has been on recently, we estimate the payout ratio could be 27%, which is comfortable for the company to continue in the future.historic-dividendAflac Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.66 total annually to $1.68. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 9.8% a year over that time. Companies like this can be very valuable over the long term, if the decent rate of growth can be maintained.The Dividend's Growth Prospects Are LimitedSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Earnings has been rising at 3.6% per annum over the last five years, which admittedly is a bit slow. If Aflac is struggling to find viable investments, it always has the option to increase its payout ratio to pay more to shareholders.Aflac Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. The distributions are easily covered by earnings, and there is plenty of cash being generated as well. However, it is worth noting that the earnings are expected to fall over the next year, which may not change the long term outlook, but could affect the dividend payment in the next 12 months. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Story continuesIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

106,167d0a3e-22d6-36ce-85ed-b008e7775284,UNP,2023-05-07,Can Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) Maintain Its Strong Returns?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/union-pacific-corporation-nyse-unp-130022431.html,1683378022,STORY,['UNP'],"[While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP).Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Union Pacific How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Union Pacific is:56% = US$7.0b ÷ US$12b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.56 in profit.Does Union Pacific Have A Good ROE?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Union Pacific has a higher ROE than the average (23%) in the Transportation industry.roeThat's clearly a positive. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk .The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityCompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesUnion Pacific's Debt And Its 56% ROEUnion Pacific does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 2.70. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.SummaryReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.But note: Union Pacific may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

107,8771cfe0-ae97-39f3-ad72-b0bb2e0e5dfe,GPS,2023-05-07,7 Retail Stocks to Avoid Following the BBBY Bankruptcy,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-retail-stocks-avoid-following-100059759.html,1683108059,STORY,"['GPS', 'WISH', 'BBBYQ', 'DBGI']","[With the bankruptcy of the embattled enterprise Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY), it’s time to discuss the worst retail stocks to sell. Understandably, bearish discussions don’t go over so well in this era of toxic positivity. However, I look at this framework as being realistic. Investing is somewhat like baseball in that you can’t expect to bat 1,000 all the time.As well, when you’re a manager of a team, you must make difficult decisions. Some enterprises just might not be able to recover; hence they belong in the category of retail stocks to avoid. Again, nobody wants to be the jerk to cut a player from the roster. However, the best teams that win championships are willing to make these tough calls.Finally, you’ve got to think about number one. Believe me, the executives of the corporations whose honor you want to defend already got their reward. So, don’t feel too bad about wanting to avoid the fallout of a potential retail stocks crash.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsGPSGap$8.91WISHContextLogic$6.49JOANJoann$1.68DBGIDigital Brands$0.75BRCCBRC.$5.07SECOSecoo$1.32APRNBlue Apron$0.54Retail Stocks to Sell: Gap (GPS)Death: grim reaper in black cloakSource: ShutterstockAs a name-brand fashion apparel retailer, Gap (NYSE:GPS) faces a significant fundamental tailwind. According to several market observers, members of Generation Z don’t really focus on fashion to be trendy or to denote status. Unfortunately, that’s a big problem for Gap because if the company lost its brand appeal, other discount apparel companies can eat its lunch.Recently, Gap announced that it will eliminate hundreds of corporate jobs to align with a broader restructuring effort. However, I’m not entirely sure that Gap can cut its way to prosperity. Again, the emerging generation doesn’t care about labels that older cohorts once did.In addition, Gap’s financials don’t provide much confidence. Presently, its equity-to-asset ratio sits at 0.2, ranked worse than 83.18% of cyclical retailers. Also, its three-year revenue growth rate is 0.6% below parity, which ranks worse than over 60% of the competition. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg GPS as a consensus moderate sell. With that, it probably ranks as one of the worst retail stocks to sell.Story continuesRetail Stocks to Sell: ContextLogic (WISH)A white clock indicates it's time to sell.Source: ShutterstockOnce a stronghold for meme-stock traders, the e-commerce platform ContextLogic (NASDAQ:WISH) may be on its last legs. Carrying a market capitalization of only $150 million, WISH represents one of the retail stocks to avoid in part because of its awful chart performance. Since the beginning of this year, WISH cratered 51% of equity value. In the past 365 days, it fell more than 86%. I’m not sure if there’s any coming back from that.To be fair, ContextLogic enjoys some redeeming statistics. For one thing, its cash-to-debt ratio pings at 55.31, ranked better than 93.23% of companies listed in the cyclical retail segment. Also, it’s deeply undervalued on paper. For example, WISH trades at 0.35-times tangible book value, “better” than 93.11% of its peers.Still, the concept of value trap makes me think WISH is really one of the retail stocks to sell. Its three-year revenue growth rate sits at 36.7% below zero. Also, its profit margins also fell into negative territory. Lastly, the consensus assessment for WISH is a hold, with two out of four analysts saying it’s a sell.Retail Stocks to Sell: Joann (JOAN)little girl holding a stock chart with athumbs down. stocks to avoidSource: ShutterstockAn online marketplace for various household goods, Joann (NASDAQ:JOAN) gives off a wholesome arts and crafts vibe. Personally, I wish them well. At the same time, investors must be realistic. Technically, JOAN rates among the retail stocks to sell because it’s just not getting it done in the charts. Since the Jan. opener, shares plunged 43%. In the trailing one-year period, they gave up nearly 84% of equity value. Frankly, it’s going to scare anyone who isn’t a meme trader.Fundamentally, JOAN sadly makes a case for retail stocks bankruptcy. First, its cash-to-debt ratio sits at 0.01 times, worse than 98.17% of the cyclical retail industry. Second, its Altman Z-Score is 0.65, indicating distress and higher-than-average bankruptcy risk.If that wasn’t bad enough, its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 0.6% below zero. On the profitability side, both operating and net margins print red ink. I wish I had better news to bring but I don’t. Right now, analysts peg JOAN as a hold: three holds, one sell, and most damningly, no buys. Thus, it’s one of the worst retail stocks.Digital Brands Group (DBGI)a frustrated man with a white board behind him that features a black downward arrowSource: ShutterstockAccording to its website, Digital Brands Group (NASDAQ:DBGI) builds impactful relationships between brands and consumers. Further, it’s a portfolio group that provides unique scaling. It has operational expertise, solves logistical challenges, and expands addressable markets through its e-commerce and retail platforms. Make of that what you will, it’s one of the retail stocks to sell.When immediately assessing the broader financial framework for Digital Brands, a few four-letter words come to mind. Just look at the data for yourselves. First, its cash-to-debt ratio sits at 0.09, worse than 85.18% of cyclical retail players. Second, its Altman Z-Score comes in at 7.81 below zero, indicating deep distress.Operationally, it suffers a three-year revenue growth rate of 14.4% below breakeven. On the bottom line, its operating and net margins sit well below the zero line. Plus, its shares trade for 77 cents a pop, making it one of the retail stocks to avoid. Also, according to Gurufocus, DBGI features a 100% probability of distress.BRC (BRCC)earningsSource: ShutterstockI’m going to tread carefully with BRC Inc (NYSE:BRCC) because the veteran-owned coffee shop catering toward conservative values commands a loyal fanbase. However, investors must be realistic with BRCC, which lost almost 18% of equity value since the Jan. opener. Just because it’s a “true” patriotically American company doesn’t necessarily make BRCC a buy. In the training year, for example, it plunged 62%.Fundamentally, BRC runs into a generational headwind. Sure, many Gen Zs love listening to conservative or even right-wing voices. However, Joe Biden didn’t become president because conservative Gen Z-ers voted in droves for Donald Trump. No, Gen Z cares (on average) about sustainability and other pressing issues such as social equity. That’s not really the BRC ethos.While the company enjoys a stout three-year revenue growth of 46.6%, it only has middling strength in the balance sheet. Also, its profit margins fell deeply into negative territory. To add insult to injury, BRCC is overvalued against tangible book value.To be sure, analysts peg BRCC as a consensus moderate buy with a 58%-plus upside price target. However, in my opinion, the data and the dwindling conservative-values market make shares one of the retail stocks to sell.Secoo Holding (SECO)a keyboard with a greet enter key marked sell, representing overvalued stocks to sellSource: ShutterstockBased in China, Secoo Holding (NASDAQ:SECO) claims to be Asia’s largest online integrated upscale products and services platform as measured by gross merchandise value in 2016. While an impressive stat, that was in 2016. For investors, they surely won’t appreciate that SECO appears to be a victim of the retail stock crash. Since the January opener, shares plunged 57%. In the trailing one-year period, they’re down more than 75%.Notably, SECO easily ranks among the retail stocks to sell, with Gurufocus warning that it suffers from five red flags and no positive (or even neutral) signs. First, Secoo’s balance sheet appears to be distressed given its Altman Z-Score of 0.3. It’s also carrying too much debt relative to its cash position.Operationally, Secoo prints a three-year revenue growth rate of 22.5% below breakeven. As for profitability, in the past 10 years, only three of them were in the black. That’s just not going to attract investors. Unsurprisingly, Gurufocus states that SECO features 99.4% of financial distress. Unless you can read the future, this is one of the worst retail stocks.Blue Apron (APRN)sell written on a chalkboard representing overvalued stocks to sellSource: ShutterstockSaving the worst for last, meal-kit delivery specialist Blue Apron (NYSE:APRN) presents an interesting idea that may be on its last legs. However, you don’t necessarily want to short APRN. According to Fintel, APRN has a short interest of 16.54% of its float. Also, on the investment platform’s proprietary Short Squeeze Score, it ranks 81.40 out of 100. So, it could fly higher for any reason or no reason at all.Fundamentally, though, APRN represents one of the retail stocks to sell. Since the January opener, shares stumbled 27%. In the trailing one-year period, they fell more than 86%. Financially, it suffers from a deeply distressed balance sheet, as evidenced by its Altman Z-Score of 5.73% below breakeven.Operationally, Blue Apron posts a three-year revenue growth rate of 28.7% below zero, ranked worse than 91.9% of its peers. Both operating and net margins average 23.82% below zero. On a final note, Gurufocus warns that Blue Apron faces a 94.95% probability of financial distress. So, it’s one of the retail stocks to avoid.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.
