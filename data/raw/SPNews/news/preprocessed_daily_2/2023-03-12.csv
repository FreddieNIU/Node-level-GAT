So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. We can see that Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) does use debt in its business. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?What Risk Does Debt Bring?Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together. See our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific How Much Debt Does Thermo Fisher Scientific Carry?The chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Thermo Fisher Scientific had US$34.4b in debt in December 2022; about the same as the year before. On the flip side, it has US$8.52b in cash leading to net debt of about US$25.8b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Healthy Is Thermo Fisher Scientific's Balance Sheet?Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Thermo Fisher Scientific had liabilities of US$17.0b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$36.0b due beyond that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$8.52b as well as receivables valued at US$9.43b due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$35.1b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.Of course, Thermo Fisher Scientific has a titanic market capitalization of US$209.6b, so these liabilities are probably manageable. Having said that, it's clear that we should continue to monitor its balance sheet, lest it change for the worse.Story continuesWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).We'd say that Thermo Fisher Scientific's moderate net debt to EBITDA ratio ( being 2.2), indicates prudence when it comes to debt. And its commanding EBIT of 18.9 times its interest expense, implies the debt load is as light as a peacock feather. Unfortunately, Thermo Fisher Scientific's EBIT flopped 17% over the last four quarters. If earnings continue to decline at that rate then handling the debt will be more difficult than taking three children under 5 to a fancy pants restaurant. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Thermo Fisher Scientific's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, Thermo Fisher Scientific recorded free cash flow worth 76% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.Our ViewThermo Fisher Scientific's interest cover was a real positive on this analysis, as was its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow. In contrast, our confidence was undermined by its apparent struggle to grow its EBIT. Considering this range of data points, we think Thermo Fisher Scientific is in a good position to manage its debt levels. But a word of caution: we think debt levels are high enough to justify ongoing monitoring. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. For example - Thermo Fisher Scientific has   2 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. This means that investors who purchase Huntington Bancshares' shares on or after the 17th of March will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 3rd of April.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.15 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$0.62 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Huntington Bancshares has a trailing yield of 4.6% on the current stock price of $13.37. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Huntington Bancshares's dividend is reliable and sustainable. So we need to investigate whether Huntington Bancshares can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. View our latest analysis for Huntington Bancshares Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Fortunately Huntington Bancshares's payout ratio is modest, at just 42% of profit.Generally speaking, the lower a company's payout ratios, the more resilient its dividend usually is.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. This is why it's a relief to see Huntington Bancshares earnings per share are up 7.5% per annum over the last five years.Story continuesAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Huntington Bancshares has delivered an average of 15% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.To Sum It UpIs Huntington Bancshares an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Huntington Bancshares has seen its earnings per share grow slowly in recent years, and the company reinvests more than half of its profits in the business, which generally bodes well for its future prospects. In summary, Huntington Bancshares appears to have some promise as a dividend stock, and we'd suggest taking a closer look at it.With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces.

But oil prices didn’t surge even after the EU embargoes and the G7 price caps on Russian crude oil and petroleum products came into effect.Russia is rerouting its oil exports to Asia, while Europe is buying more crude and products from the Middle East, Asia, and the United States.Yet, one of the most significant shifts in global oil trade in decades has not been the key driving force in oil markets in recent weeks.It’s the economy. Inflation, manufacturing, employment, and business activity data from the United States and China – the world’s two largest economies – are the primary drivers of the oil futures market now.The Fed is closely watching every economic data point in the United States to gauge whether to accelerate or slow the pace of interest rate hikes. Stronger U.S. economic data and still high inflation could prompt the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates more than initially expected, raising the odds of a material slowdown and even recession in the coming months.On the other hand, the markets – including the oil futures market – are closely watching the economic trends in China, which has reopened from almost three years of zero-Covid lockdowns and is expected to see a rebound in economic growth and oil consumption this year.These two opposing economic forces are currently pulling the oil market in opposite directions, leaving prices stuck in a narrow $80-$85 range per barrel Brent.“Rangebound for months and in no hurry to change that amid a balanced flow of supply and demand related news, the market is likely to pay close attention to the general level of risk appetite which is currently being dictated by the FOMC and its close attention to incoming data,” Saxo Bank said this week just before Friday’s U.S. jobs report.Story continuesOil prices, adjusted for inflation, have now slumped by 40% in one year since  March 8, 2022, high, weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine, Reuters’ senior market analyst John Kemp notes. Moreover, the price volatility in the front-month contract has dipped to an annualized rate of less than 25%, compared to 88% in March last year.The rate hikes and concerns about a potential slowdown in the U.S. economy are pulling oil prices down.“Decelerating growth continues to weigh on crude prices but if fears of a hard landing for the US economy are alleviated, WTI crude could find a home above the $80 a barrel,” Ed Moya, Senior Market Analyst, The Americas at OANDA, said on Thursday.  At the same time, expectations of a Chinese economic and oil demand rebound are limiting the downside. If China rebounds strongly after the reopening, prices could break above the recent tight range, considering that global inventories are below the five-year average and signs are emerging of a tighter physical crude market.In a soft landing for the U.S. economy, prices could soon hit $90 per barrel, some of the world’s biggest physical traders of oil say.Trafigura expects prices to start rising due to the major shifts in oil trade over the past year, its co-head of oil trading Ben Luckock said at the CERAWeek energy conference this week.According to Luckock, the Chinese rebound is “for real,” as Trafigura is seeing rising demand for minerals and metals and the volumes of crude oil China has imported over the past six weeks, the executive said, as carried by The Wall Street Journal.Oil prices could hit the $90-$100 per barrel range in the second half of this year as global demand is set to reach record levels while supply remains constrained, Russell Hardy, CEO at the world’s largest independent oil trader, Vitol Group, told Bloomberg Television last week.While the Russian invasion of Ukraine and its impact on supply and the energy markets continues to hang over the oil market, the economies of the United States and China are dictating current price trends and will determine where prices will go when they break out of the current range.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Dealerships Struggle To Remain Relevant As Automakers Go Direct To ConsumerWhy Illinois Needs To Reconsider Its Total Moratorium On Nuclear EnergyVenture Capital Invested Billions In Emerging Market Agri-Tech Startups In 2022Read this article on OilPrice.com]"

As oil and gas companies acknowledge the inevitability of an energy transition in the future, many are pumping funds into their clean energy business and returning money to shareholders. However, energy experts are concerned that underinvestment in oil and gas could threaten the world’s energy security at a time when the demand for fossil fuels is high and climbing.The CEO of Saudi Arabia’s oil giant Saudi Aramco, Amin Nasser, told media sources this month that “A persistent underinvestment in oil upstream and even downstream is still there. The latest report from the IEA talks about a demand of 101.7 million barrels — going from 100 million barrels in 2022 to almost 2 million barrels more with China opening up and the aviation industry,” which has not yet returned to pre-Covid levels.Nasser explained, “There is a lot of potential for growth in aviation,” adding, “And with China opening up and the lack of investment, there is definitely a concern in the mid-to-long term in terms of making sure there is adequate supplies in the market.” He also suggested that while substantial U.S. fuel supplies have supported a fall in oil prices, the slowing of drilling activities could threaten the future supply.Nasser is the latest of several energy experts to state their concern about underinvestment in the industry. Upstream spending has fallen from around $700 billion in 2014 to between $370 to $400 billion today. While this reflects the expansion of the energy industry to include alternative cleaner forms of energy and a gradual move away from fossil fuels, this is very low considering the continued high demand for oil and gas.There is also a concern about the ongoing reliance on mature oil fields, which will eventually dry up. The average global decline rate of oilfields is around 6%, meaning companies need to offset their production rate to ensure the intended output. One way to address this is to invest in exploration and development in other oil regions to establish new projects. But with many companies unwilling to invest in new operations that could take decades to get off the ground, the world may have to eventually face an undersupply of oil and gas.Story continuesThe issue of underinvestment was addressed last year at the Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition &amp; Conference (ADIPEC), where experts discussed the balance between energy security and sustainability. Many industry leaders highlighted the concern that energy security had been seemingly sacrificed by some for sustainability, resulting in significant underinvestment in oil and gas. Many at the conference viewed the underinvestment as reckless, suggesting many firms have followed policymakers and public sentiment that have been pushing a premature energy transition.With energy security at the center of the discussion, particularly following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and subsequent sanctions on Russian energy, the ADIPEC debated whether the move away from oil and gas is coming too soon, with many renewable energy projects still in the nascent stage and a potential gap between supply and demand of both fossil fuels and green alternatives. Industry leaders at ADIPEC determined that the persistent and severe underinvestment in energy supply, driven by pressure from governments, activists, investors, and banks, has been a major stimulus for the current energy crisis and represents a huge threat to global energy security.This may come as a shock to many in the wake of a year of high profits for oil and gas companies. It seemed inevitable that energy firms would pump funds back into operations to ensure the future supply. However, with greater pressures to decarbonize and policies encouraging greater investment in green energy – with several tax cuts and incentives to push this agenda, many oil and gas firms have chosen to invest their money elsewhere.Research by JP Morgan predicts a $400 billion oil underspend to 2030. And while much of this spending will, instead, go towards non-fossil fuels, the firm’s research demonstrates that neither oil and gas nor alternative energy will grow at the rate needed to meet the growing global demand, resulting in more energy crises in the coming years. Focusing on the fossil fuels underspend, Christyan Malek, JP Morgan's Global Head of Energy Strategy stated, “In contrast with renewables, the oil industry is comparatively starved of capital but with an abundance of projects and potential supply to be tapped into.” He added that due to the anticipated high demand over the next decade, “oil is really where we see the greatest need for incremental investment, both in sustaining the existing production base, as well as growing it, as we see 2030 demand 7.1 million bpd above 2019 levels, with current spending levels implying a 700,000-bpd average gap to 2030.”Despite high profits, the ongoing high demand for oil and gas, and the current energy crisis – which has revealed severe supply shortages when Russian energy is removed – there continues to be significant underinvestment in fossil fuels. While this could be seen as positive for the green transition, experts fear that there will not be enough green energy to fill the gap in supply and demand by the time that fossil fuel projects wane, resulting in greater energy insecurity and more energy crises in the future.By Felicity Bradstock for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Trade Is Moving Away From EuropeSmall Nuclear Reactors Get Boost As Western Cities Vote ‘Yes’Shell Is Reviewing Its Plan To Reduce Oil Production This DecadeRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

That would be a rise of 15 percent on the 52.2 million metric tons it shipped last year. Next year, it intends to ramp up exports by another 20 percent to 72 million metric tons. If successful, that would amount to a 38 percent rise over two years.This is possible after an expansion on Kazakhstan’s section of the CPC pipeline, completed in January, increased its capacity from the current 53.7 million metric tons to 72.5 million.Kazakhstan is heavily dependent on the CPC, which carries four-fifths of its oil exports. Russia is not: Kazakh oil accounted for 88 percent of the CPC’s shipments in 2022.Kazakh supplies through the CPC were down 1 percent in 2022, owing to pipeline disruptions, but still accounted for 81 percent of Kazakhstan’s exports of 64.3 million metric tons.Pipelines to Russia carried 94 percent of Kazakh oil, with the CPC accounting for the bulk and a pipeline from the Kazakh city of Atyrau to the Russian city of Samara delivering the remaining 13 percent.Story continuesThe rest of the oil went across the Caspian Sea by tanker to join the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline to Turkey (2.3 million tons, or nearly 4 percent of Kazakhstan’s exports) and to China along the Atasu-Alashankou pipeline (1.2 million, or nearly 2 percent).Small amounts were shipped to the Georgian port of Batumi and Uzbekistan, Reuters reported.On orders from President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, Kazakhstan is seeking to diversify export routes because of the war, by implication to reduce reliance on sanctions-hit Russia.That is Kazakhstan’s “number one problem,” Akchulakov told the Houston energy conference.Building a new pipeline to carry oil east across the Caspian Sea could take up to five years, he said. He did not mention that Russia, as a littoral state, would certainly try to veto it.Kazakhstan upped oil supplies via non-Russian routes last year, but only by 638,000 tons, according to Reuters.In late February Kazakhstan started pumping oil to Germany, to make up for shortfalls after EU countries banned most Russian oil. But that oil still must pass through Russia.Kazakhstan has agreed to ship 300,000 tons to Germany in the first quarter of this year through the Druzhba pipeline across Russia, reached via the Atyrau-Samara pipeline, and has applied to send 1.2 million tons along the route this year. The ever-bullish energy minister has said Kazakhstan could in theory find up to 6 million tons to send to Europe annually.But the first shipment of 20,000 tons was delayed from January, and Kazakhstan “is struggling to find enough crude oil to meet requests from European countries for deliveries through Russia’s Druzhba pipeline system that would allow them to reduce their dealings with Moscow,” Bloomberg reported this week, citing anonymous sources and blaming falls in output on maintenance work at oilfields.In addition, Bloomberg said, Kazakh oil producers are “wary of using the Druzhba link because they can earn better returns by using other export routes.”Energy officials also used the Houston forum to talk up Kazakhstan’s rebranding of its oil to disassociate it from Russian oil.Oil from Kazakhstan was previously exported as REBCO, Russian Export Blend Crude Oil, which the world knows better as Urals crude, but last June was rechristened KEBCO. That allowed Kazakhstan to “minimize risks to Kazakhstan’s oil and gas companies,” Magzum Mirzagaliyev, the head of state energy firm KazMunaiGaz, said.There is evidence for that: KEBCO is trading at about $20 more per barrel than REBCO, according to Reuters.Kazakhstan is forecasting oil output at 90.5 million metric tons this year, and exports at 71 million tons. But as Energy Minister Akchulakov pointed out, Astana’s oil ambitions are dependent on the vagaries of the war in Ukraine.“I believe that events in geopolitics create an ocean of uncertainty,” he said, which made forecasting difficult. “However, we have to move forward. There are many opportunities.”By Joanna Lillis via Eurasianet.orgMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Why Illinois Needs To Reconsider Its Total Moratorium On Nuclear EnergyVenture Capital Invested Billions In Emerging Market Agri-Tech Startups In 2022Zangezur Corridor At Risk As Azerbaijan-Armenia Dispute ContinuesRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

(AP) — Gas prices surged in New Jersey and around the nation at large, but analysts say the increase could be short-lived amid a recent drop in demand and the cost of crude oil.AAA Mid-Atlantic says the average price of a gallon of regular gas in New Jersey on Friday was $3.30, up 10 cents from last week. Drivers were paying $4.37 a gallon on average a year ago at this time.The national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline was $3.47, up eight cents from last week. Drivers were paying $4.31 a gallon on average a year ago at this time.Analysts say less expensive oil and fewer people fueling up their vehicles usually lowers prices at the pump. If that continues, they say, prices are likely to drop despite some recent upward price pressure due to the switch to more expensive summer blend gasoline, which has a lower volatility to limit evaporative emissions that normally increase with warm weather.]"

Businesses in decline often have two underlying trends, firstly, a declining return on capital employed (ROCE) and a declining base of capital employed. Ultimately this means that the company is earning less per dollar invested and on top of that, it's shrinking its base of capital employed. So after we looked into Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL), the trends above didn't look too great.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Ralph Lauren, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.11 = US$599m ÷ (US$7.0b - US$1.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).So, Ralph Lauren has an ROCE of 11%.  In isolation, that's a pretty standard return but against the Luxury industry average of 18%, it's not as good. See our latest analysis for Ralph Lauren roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Ralph Lauren compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Can We Tell From Ralph Lauren's ROCE Trend?In terms of Ralph Lauren's historical ROCE movements, the trend doesn't inspire confidence. Unfortunately the returns on capital have diminished from the 15% that they were earning five years ago. Meanwhile, capital employed in the business has stayed roughly the flat over the period. Companies that exhibit these attributes tend to not be shrinking, but they can be mature and facing pressure on their margins from competition. If these trends continue, we wouldn't expect Ralph Lauren to turn into a multi-bagger.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayAll in all, the lower returns from the same amount of capital employed aren't exactly signs of a compounding machine. Despite the concerning underlying trends, the stock has actually gained 15% over the last five years, so it might be that the investors are expecting the trends to reverse. Either way, we aren't huge fans of the current trends and so with that we think you might find better investments elsewhere.If you want to know some of the risks facing Ralph Lauren we've found 2 warning signs (1 is potentially serious!) that you should be aware of before investing here.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Indeed, most growth stocks provide significant volatility. In this market, that’s not necessarily a great thing.That said, this bucket also includes companies that are also relatively stable. These are companies operating in mature industries with a track record of delivering value to shareholders. Traditionally, growth stock investing is more geared toward upside potential at all costs, thus introducing greater risk.However, investors realize the more significant potential for long-term wealth creation by investing in stable growth stocks. Moreover, finding high-growth companies that tend to be less volatile than other stocks can produce outsized gains, particularly for those on the more risk-averse end of the spectrum.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThese are the top growth stocks on my list right now. Each of these companies provide impressive potential for capital appreciation over the long-haul.CALCaleres$26.01AVTAAvantax$26.52POSTPost Holdings$89.32CEIXCONSOL Energy$58.75MSAMSA Safety$136.02ROPRoper Technologies$422.18PXDPioneer Natural Resources$206.33Caleres (CAL)Source: ShutterstockCaleres (NYSE:CAL) is a global footwear company that designs, manufactures, and markets several footwear brands. Its stock has growth potential based on a few critical metrics. The company’s business portfolio includes well-known brands such as Famous Footwear and Dr. Scholl’s. The company also distributes its products through department stores, online retailers, and wholesalers.Based on one of the most basic metrics we can assess, the consensus analyst target price for this stock, CAL stock has a roughly 35% upside over its current $26.50 share price. That’s encouraging for investors, but there are other reasons to be excited.For one, Caleres’ 3-year EBITDA growth rate of 59.8% is higher than 91% of the apparel manufacturing industry. A higher EBITDA generally correlates to greater operational efficiency, so Caleres appears to be a well-oiled machine.Story continuesFurther, CAL stock boasts serious momentum over the trailing 12 months. That suggests that investing now represents a chance to catch the wave of momentum and associated capital returns.Avantax (AVTA)A close-up view of the ""tax law"" folder in a directory.Source: ShutterstockGrowth investors looking for stability should consider Avantax (NASDAQ:AVTA) stock. The Dallas-based firm offers financial services to individual investors and businesses. The company provides its customers various investment management, tax planning, and financial planning services. As readers may have guessed by its name, Avantax helps individuals and businesses find the most advantageous tax strategies.AVTA stock boasts strong growth over the previous 12 months, increasing from under $20 per share to around $27 per share. With tax season underway, there’s good reason to believe its revenues will continue to grow and its share price will move higher.While AVTA stock indeed boasts growth potential, it also represents value. Its price-earnings ratio of 3.3-times is meager by sector standards, and low relative to the company’s history.Avantax is also quickly growing its assets under management (AUM). In 2022, the firm upped its AUM by $1.7 billion, a 79% increase over year-end totals in 2021.Post Holdings (POST)Sign of Post Foods Canada Inc. on its plant building in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada. Owned by Post Holdings, an American consumer packaged goodsSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comDefensive stocks such as Post Holdings (NYSE:POST) aren’t usually grouped within the growth category. However, the consumer packaged goods company recently expanded into a growth area with its $1.2 billion acquisition of several pet food brands from J.M. Smucker (NYSE:SJM). Post Holdings also operates as a contract manufacturer, and can generally be regarded as a defensive stock, as many of its products are essential staples that exhibit inelastic demand.But back to that recent acquisition. Post Holdings splashed out $1.2 billion on Feb. 8 to acquire a line of brands that effectively establish a pet food platform for the firm. The company noted the growth potential in the category while also classifying the transaction as immediately accretive after one-time costs. Essentially, Post believes the large capital outlay will quickly pay for itself as consumers are increasingly willing to spend money on their pets.Post Holdings raised its fiscal year 2023 guidance just days earlier, which also bodes well for investors.CONSOL Energy (CEIX)A man holds coal in his hands over a pile of more coalSource: ShutterstockCONSOL Energy (NYSE:CEIX) stock represents a bituminous coal producer in Northern Appalachia. CEIX operates several mines and related facilities in Pennsylvania and West Virginia and has a diverse customer base, including utilities, industrial customers, and export markets. Primarily, CONSOL Energy sells to power generation plants and metallurgical end-users.CEIX stock has momentum on its side. That leads investors to be keen on the shares. Yet, there’s plenty of remaining upside. Analysts expect CEIX stock to reach nearly $80 in the next 12-18 months. That’s significantly higher than its current price of  less than $60. Factor in its quarterly $1.10 dividend, and its growth potential is much more significant.There are several reasons to anticipate that CEIX shares should continue to grow. For one, the company’s earnings per share have increased 66.9% over the past three years. And its free cash flow growth rate of 69.3% over the past three years is another robust metric for the firm, suggesting that its share price will continue its upward trend.MSA Safety (MSA)Back View of the Head of the Project Holds Laptop and Discussing Product Details with Chief Engineer while They Walk Through Modern Factory., FR rents out these spaces in the U.S.Source: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock.comMSA Safety (NYSE:MSA) is an industrial stock with a solid upside. The company manufactures and supplies safety products for workers in hazardous environments. That portfolio includes respiratory protection equipment, gas detection instruments, fall protection systems, and fire helmets. MSA serves the broader industrial sector, including construction, mining, oil and gas, and public safety.Growth is most often associated with share prices that are expected to rise. MSA stock is expected to appreciate, but also has a rock-solid dividend. It yields a modest 1.39% but its distribution hasn’t been reduced since 1971. That means it’s a dividend king following 50+ years of uninterrupted dividend growth.Investors should logically anticipate growth that will flow from its growing business. MSA Safety reported record Q4 revenue of $443 million recently and a record $1.53 billion in 2022 revenue. That strong momentum is expected to continue as the company addresses an order backlog throughout 2023, which indicates top-line growth is to continue.Roper Technologies (ROP)Image of Roper Technologies logo visible on display screenSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comRoper Technologies (NYSE:ROP) provides software and engineering solutions to various industries. The company’s portfolio includes products and services in software-as-a-service (SaaS), instrumentation, imaging, and network software. Roper Technologies is industry agnostic, serving diverse customers in the healthcare, transportation, energy, and academia sectors.The company has exhibited strong results recently, with earnings beats in the past four quarters. Several of those earnings moments exceeded the high end of the analyst range. So, it’s clear that the company can provide rapid growth.And that is reflected in its most recent earnings report. The company’s Q4 revenue increased by 14% to $1.43 billion and 11% in 2022, reaching $5.37 billion.Roper views its diverse customer base as a strong tailwind for the remainder of 2023. It also believes demand for what it refers to as ‘mission critical software’ will cause revenues to rise 5-6% in 2023.Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD)Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD) logo seen on a smartphone with a green and yellow backgroundSource: rafapress / ShutterstockPioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD) is an independent energy company that explores, develops, and produces oil and gas resources in the United States. The company has a diversified portfolio of assets that spans the Permian Basin, the Rockies, and the Mid-Continent region.Like many energy firms, Pioneer Natural Resources had an excellent 2022. Q4 and full-year cash flows reached $1.7 billion and $8.4 billion, respectively. Additionally, the company repurchased $1.65 billion of shares in 2022. Its stock provides a sky-high dividend yield of 13% currently. Such a high yield generally indicates higher risk. However, the analysts covering PXD stock expect it to move $50 upward from its current $209 share price.It also created a lot of value in 2022 based on its return on invested capital of 30%. That’s an impressive number, but not much higher than its historical ROIC of 24.93%.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

But across the board there are plenty of stocks that underperform the market. That's what has happened with the PPG Industries, Inc. (NYSE:PPG) share price. It's up 34% over three years, but that is below the market return. At least the stock price is up over the last year, albeit only by 4.8%.While this past week has detracted from the company's three-year return, let's look at the recent trends of the underlying business and see if the gains have been in alignment. See our latest analysis for PPG Industries While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over the last three years, PPG Industries failed to grow earnings per share, which fell 5.9% (annualized).This means it's unlikely the market is judging the company based on earnings growth. Therefore, we think it's worth considering other metrics as well.The modest 2.0% dividend yield is unlikely to be propping up the share price. It could be that the revenue growth of 8.6% per year is viewed as evidence that PPG Industries is growing. If the company is being managed for the long term good, today's shareholders might be right to hold on.The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. If you are thinking of buying or selling PPG Industries stock, you should check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Story continuesWhat About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for PPG Industries the TSR over the last 3 years was 41%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that PPG Industries shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 6.9% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 4% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand PPG Industries better, we need to consider many other factors. Even so, be aware that  PPG Industries is showing  3 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those is concerning...Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

25,464e42db-b1b8-3223-9ecc-d6806d4c9191,AIG,2023-03-12,"American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) Looks Like A Good Stock, And It's Going Ex-Dividend Soon",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-international-group-inc-nyse-131553737.html,1678540553,STORY,['AIG'],"[American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. This means that investors who purchase American International Group's shares on or after the 16th of March will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 31st of March.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.32 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$1.28 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, American International Group has a trailing yield of 2.4% on the current stock price of $53.15. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. View our latest analysis for American International Group Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. American International Group paid out just 9.7% of its profit last year, which we think is conservatively low and leaves plenty of margin for unexpected circumstances.When a company paid out less in dividends than it earned in profit, this generally suggests its dividend is affordable. The lower the % of its profit that it pays out, the greater the margin of safety for the dividend if the business enters a downturn.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. It's encouraging to see American International Group has grown its earnings rapidly, up 61% a year for the past five years.Story continuesAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, American International Group has lifted its dividend by approximately 12% a year on average. It's exciting to see that both earnings and dividends per share have grown rapidly over the past few years.Final TakeawayIs American International Group worth buying for its dividend? Companies like American International Group that are growing rapidly and paying out a low fraction of earnings, are usually reinvesting heavily in their business. Perhaps even more importantly - this can sometimes signal management is focused on the long term future of the business. We think this is a pretty attractive combination, and would be interested in investigating American International Group more closely.So while American International Group looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 1 warning sign with American International Group and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see. Here's a curated list of interesting stocks that are strong dividend payers.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

However, on the plus side, the index has gained nearly 5% year-to-date through March 7. So while your first instinct might be to focus on S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy that are on a roll, I’m going with some of the index’s worst-performing stocks from February.According to MarketWatch, the seven worst-performing sectors experienced declines ranging from -7.6% (energy) to -2.5% (consumer staples) in February. For this article, I’ll select seven S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy that made MarketWatch’s list of February’s 20 worst performers across most of the seven sectors.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsI’m interested in honing in on seven S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy that backslid in February but mostly have moved higher over the past five years. Here are my seven S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy that stumbled in February. COPConocoPhillips$107.05GENGen Digital$18.45DPZDomino’s Pizza$311.17NEMNewmont Corp.$42.01MRNAModerna$141.11EOGEOG Resources$117.57VFCVF Corp.$24.01ConocoPhillips (COP)a sign in front of the Conoco Philips office buildingSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) lost 15.2% in February, gained 63.5% in 2022, and is up 95.5% over the past five years. The oil and gas producer hit its lowest point in March 2020. That’s when COP stock traded for less than $27. It’s amazing what an $80 barrel will do for a company’s share price. Of the 29 analysts covering its stock, 22 rate it “Overweight” or an outright “Buy,” with an average target price of $137.29, 28% higher than where it’s currently trading.In early February, COP reported Q4 2022 results. The company generated $28.5 billion in cash from operations for the full year, topping the analyst consensus estimate. Its earnings per share for the year were $13.52, more than double the year before.In 2023, it expects production of 1.78 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (MMBOED), up by 42 MMBOED from 2022. Its total realized price in 2022 was $79.82, 46% higher than in 2021. Story continuesBased on the analyst EPS estimate of $11.16, COP trades at just 9.6x its 2023 earnings.   Gen Digital (GEN)Hand with pen marking holographic chart with the word ""AI""Source: shutterstock.com/everything possibleGen Digital (NASDAQ:GEN) lost 15.2% in February and 17.5% in 2022 but is up 34.2% over the past five years.When I saw the name Gen Digital on the list of 20 stocks, it took me a moment to realize this was the name of the former Norton LifeLock. The cybersecurity firm merged with Avast in an $8.1 billion cash and stock transaction in September 2022. As a result, Avast shareholders received $5.97 billion in cash and 94.2 million shares of Norton LifeLock stock. A few months after the merger closed, the company renamed itself Gen Digital. The company reported Q3 2022 bookings growth of 35%, excluding currency, to $966 million, its 14th consecutive quarter of growth. In terms of profits, its operating income in the third quarter was $526 million, 48% higher than a year earlier. The company’s biggest issue is the debt taken to pay for the Avast merger. In April 2022, before the deal’s completion, it had $2.74 billion in long-term debt. At the end of December, it was nearly 4x higher, at $9.83 billion. That’s a big reason for the stock’s dismal performance over the past year. With a 2.7% dividend yield, get paid to wait for the company to whittle down its debt to a more acceptable level.    Domino’s Pizza (DPZ)A tall Domino's Pizza (DPZ) sign stands in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comDomino’s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) lost 16.7% in February and 38.6% in 2022 but is up 35.0% over the past five years. In February 2020, people compared Domino’s to Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) regarding above-average long-term performance. CNBC suggested that if you invested in the pizza chain’s IPO in 2004, you would have achieved a 5,438% return, 85% higher than Alphabet’s return from its 2004 IPO. In the three years since the article, Alphabet’s stock redeemed itself, outperforming DPZ by 42 percentage points.As the company’s most recent earnings results show, Domino’s is having difficulties with the delivery segment of its business. Part of the problem is that many of its customers are less inclined to pay delivery fees because of the existing inflationary pressures, a situation that’s affecting a significant segment of its customer base.To reduce the stresses on its delivery business, it has offered customers lower carryout pizza prices. It’s worked at getting its locations better staffed to deal with the increased carryout business. As a result, it now generates more than 50% of its U.S. sales from carryout.  Trading at 2.52x sales, it hasn’t been this cheap since 2013.Newmont Corp. (NEM)Newmont logo on a mobile phone screenSource: Piotr Swat/ShutterstockNewmont Corp. (NYSE:NEM) lost 17.6% in February and 23.9% in 2022 but is up 12.70% over the past five years.Newmont Corporation is one of the world’s leading gold miners, operating in North America, South America, Australia, and Africa. In 2022, Newmont produced 6.0 million ounces of gold and 1.3 million ounces of gold equivalent (copper, silver, lead, and zinc). It expects 2023 production of between 5.7 million and 6.3 million ounces of gold. In addition, it has reserves of 96 million gold ounces, leaving it with decades of production. In 2022, it made approximately $581 per ounce of gold it sold this past year. While that’s down from $726 in 2021, it still generated $1.07 billion in free cash flow after investing $2.7 billion in near-term, cash-generating projects. The company will pay a base dividend of $1 in 2023 and an incremental dividend between 40 and 80 cents based on gold prices and free cash flow. The March dividend payment is 40 cents. The annual rate of $1.60 is at the midpoint of its guidance for 2023. It yields 3.8%.Newmont is trying to reel in Australian gold producer Newcrest Mining (OTCMKTS:NCMGY). It’s offered $17 billion for the company, but Newcrest rejected it. However, it has left open the possibility of Newmont sweetening the deal.Moderna (MRNA)Moderna (MRNA) research Coronavirus (Covid 19) vaccine. Row of vaccine bottles with blurred Moderna company logo on background.Source: Carlos l Vives / Shutterstock.comModerna (NASDAQ:MRNA) lost 21.2% in February and 29.3% in 2022 but is up a whopping 658.3% over the past five years. At the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, MRNA traded at $450.Asset manager ClearBridge Investments—it manages nearly $152 billion in assets worldwide—had good things to say about Moderna in its Q4 2022 investor letter for its ClearBridge Select Strategy.Clearbridge gets paid billions of dollars to analyze these things. So if it’s optimistic that Moderna’s got a post-Covid future, I won’t dispute this possibility. Analysts are optimistic about Moderna. Of the 21 covering MRNA, 11 rate it “Overweight” or outright “Buy,” with an average target price of $222, much higher than where it’s currently trading. However, one analyst has a “Sell rating with a $93 target.The risk/reward proposition is tilted in the investor’s favor at the moment.  EOG Resources (EOG)EOG Resources logo on the website homepage. EOG stock.Source: Casimiro PT. / ShutterstockEOG Resources (NYSE:EOG) lost 14.5% in February. It gained 45.8% in 2022 and is up 15.0% over the past five years. A year ago, I wrote an article about 10 S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy that were trading within 5% of their 52-week high. I thought these companies would keep moving higher through 2022 and into 2023. EOG was one of the 10 names. From November 2020 through June 2022, EOG stock went on a 316% run. It went on a second run in 2022, gaining 41% over six weeks in late September through early November. It’s been pretty much downhill ever since. I like its capital allocation strategy, paying out $2.7 billion of its free cash flow in 2021 for share repurchases, regular dividends, and a $1 special dividend. In 2022, it generated $7.65 billion in free cash flow, returning $5.27 billion to shareholders. That included four special dividends totaling $5.80. It will pay another special dividend at the end of March. You don’t get much more special than special dividends.VF Corp. (VFC)Image of a giant boot in the street surrounded by people.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comVF Corp. (NYSE:VFC) lost 19.8% in February, 62.3% in 2022, and 67.0% over the past five years. In December, Steve Rendle stepped down as CEO of the company after nearly six years in the top job and 25 with VF. Board member Benno Dorer stepped in as interim CEO while the board searched for Rendle’s replacement. This is an important decision for the company, so it will probably take a while. The company’s iconic brands include The North Face, Vans, Timberland, Supreme, and Dickies. There are several examples of holding companies that have successfully pieced together a group of apparel businesses and been very successful. LVMH (OTCMKTS:LVMUY) and Tapestry (NYSE:TPR) come to mind. In February, VF reaffirmed its fiscal 2023 (March year-end) full-year guidance of 3% revenue growth and adjusted earnings per share of $2.10 at the midpoint of its outlook. For fiscal 2024, it expects at least revenue growth in the low-single-digits and double-digit growth in operating earnings. When VF stock hit its all-time high of $100.25 in January 2020, investors valued it at 3.12x sales. Today, the company’s stock can be had for nearly one-quarter that multiple. It might have problems, but those will get sorted out when the new CEO comes in. So if you want to wait until the announcement, that’s not a bad move, but put it on your watch list because it’s not a $25 stock.     On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(NYSE:PHM) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in four days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase PulteGroup's shares before the 17th of March to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 4th of April.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.16 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$0.64 to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that PulteGroup has a trailing yield of 1.2% on the current share price of $53.47. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to investigate whether PulteGroup can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. See our latest analysis for PulteGroup If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. PulteGroup has a low and conservative payout ratio of just 5.4% of its income after tax. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 26% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio.It's positive to see that PulteGroup's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. It's encouraging to see PulteGroup has grown its earnings rapidly, up 51% a year for the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing very quickly, and the company is paying out a relatively low percentage of its profit and cash flow. Companies with growing earnings and low payout ratios are often the best long-term dividend stocks, as the company can both grow its earnings and increase the percentage of earnings that it pays out, essentially multiplying the dividend.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. PulteGroup has delivered 12% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it.The Bottom LineHas PulteGroup got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? We love that PulteGroup is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. These characteristics suggest the company is reinvesting in growing its business, while the conservative payout ratio also implies a reduced risk of the dividend being cut in the future. There's a lot to like about PulteGroup, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it.While it's tempting to invest in PulteGroup for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. Be aware that PulteGroup is showing 3 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 2 of those are a bit unpleasant...If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

40,e63cdeeb-c72a-3d63-8ac6-f1e70f5c306d,MDT,2023-03-12,Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) stock falls 8.0% in past week as one-year earnings and shareholder returns continue downward trend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medtronic-nyse-mdt-stock-falls-140027787.html,1678543227,STORY,['MDT'],"[It's easy to match the overall market return by buying an index fund. But if you buy individual stocks, you can do both better or worse than that. Unfortunately the Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) share price slid 26% over twelve months. That's disappointing when you consider the market declined 8.3%. At least the damage isn't so bad if you look at the last three years, since the stock is down 14% in that time. Even worse, it's down 8.2% in about a month, which isn't fun at all. We do note, however, that the broader market is down 5.9% in that period, and this may have weighed on the share price.With the stock having lost 8.0% in the past week, it's worth taking a look at business performance and seeing if there's any red flags. View our latest analysis for Medtronic There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Unhappily, Medtronic had to report a 16% decline in EPS over the last year. The share price decline of 26% is actually more than the EPS drop. This suggests the EPS fall has made some shareholders are more nervous about the business.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Medtronic's TSR for the last 1 year was -24%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Medtronic shareholders are down 24% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 8.3%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 1.2% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. Importantly, we haven't analysed Medtronic's dividend history.

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI).Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. See our latest analysis for Crown Castle How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Crown Castle is:22% = US$1.7b ÷ US$7.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.22 in profit.Does Crown Castle Have A Good Return On Equity?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Crown Castle has a superior ROE than the average (6.7%) in the REITs industry.roeThat's clearly a positive. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk. To know the 3 risks we have identified for Crown Castle visit our risks dashboard for free.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesCrown Castle's Debt And Its 22% ROEIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Crown Castle, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 2.88. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.ConclusionReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider.

However, many of these stocks are overpriced, with questionable prospects. There are much better second chance stocks candidates out there.Plenty of higher-quality names remain overlooked. Selling at far more reasonable prices, they all have the potential to make a strong recovery in the future. Sometimes, this is due to short-term factors negatively affecting sentiment.Once said factors clear up, sentiment will improve, propelling the stock to higher prices. In other cases, certain catalysts/factors are enabling the underlying company to deliver strong operating results, but investors are only slowly catching on.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThat’s the story here, with these seven second chance stocks. Unloved and out of favor for now, consider inspecting each of them now, either as potential buys, or as possible names to add to your watchlist.DISWalt Disney$98.95DISHDISH Network$11.16MVLAMovella Holdings$2.16NSCNorfolk Southern$215.18PYPLPayPal Holdings’$75.76TDToronto-Dominion Bank$62.98VZVerizon Communications$37.49Walt Disney (DIS)Entrance to Walt Disney World park. DIS stock.Source: VIAVAL TOURS / ShutterstockAs I have argued recently, Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) isn’t exactly the most magical stock on Earth right now. Yes, shares moved moderately higher last month.The market reacted positively to news that the media conglomerate agreed to a push from activist investor Nelson Peltz to reduce costs, and planned to reinstate its dividend.However, this renewed bullishness didn’t last long. DIS stock has since coughed back these gains. Given it seemed premature to bring back the dividend, and questionable whether cost-cutting alone will help improve results, I recommended investors sit things out for now.Still, while I still give DIS a D rating in Portfolio Grader, it may still be worthwhile to keep it on your watchlist. I still give shares a B rating for earnings, and if purchased at the right prices, the stock could deliver strong returns if a true turnaround takes shape.Story continuesDISH Network (DISH)A van for DISH Network (DISH) is parked.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comDISH Network (NASDAQ:DISH) is best known as a provider of satellite television service, but they have focused on becoming a major provider of wireless internet recent years.However, while this growth catalyst made the market excited about DISH stock during 2021, since then, sentiment has shifted in a big way, as the company has experienced subscriber losses for both its TV and wireless internet services. As a result, shares have fallen sharply during this timeframe, from the low-$40s to the low-teens per share.Pessimism about DISH continues, as seen in a recent “double downgrade” from BofA analyst David Barden.I currently give the stock a D rating in Portfolio Grader. Earning an A for earnings, and trading at a single-digit forward price-to-earnings (or P/E) ratio, it may now be one of the second chance stocks, at its current super-low valuation.Movella Holdings (MVLA)A picture of a notepad with Special Purpose Acquisition Company written on it, surrounded by office supplies.Source: Dmitry Demidovich/ShutterStock.comMovella Holdings (NASDAQ:MVLA) is a motion capture technology company that last than a month ago went public via a special purpose acquisition company (or SPAC) merger with Pathfinder Acquisition.But not too long after debuting in the public markets, MVLA stock experienced a staggering price drop. Trading for around $10 per share ahead of the deal closing on Feb. 10, MVLA now changes hands for around $2.16 per share, a more than 77% decline. I currently give MVLA a D rating overall, but an A grade for earnings.As stated in its SPAC merger presentation, they expect the company to report breakeven EBITDA in 2023, and become profitable on an EBITDA basis in 2024.With trends like the metaverse help re-accelerate growth, after making a poor first impression, Movella may have a shot at improving its reputation in the future. This makes MLVA worth keeping an eye on.Norfolk Southern (NSC)Source: ShutterstockAs you likely know, railroad Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) is in the regulatory crosshairs, considering the widely reported East Palestine, Ohio train derailment in February, as well as other derailments/safety incidents, including a more recent one.Moving lower because of the uncertainty and controversy, NSC stock right now earns a D rating in Portfolio Grader, albeit with a B grade for earnings.It may take some time before the company fully resolves the liabilities and regulatory scrutiny resulting from the aforementioned major derailment.That said, with the market pricing in these risks, shares may soon enter second chance stocks territory. NSC right now trades for around 15.5 times earnings.While in-line with the valuations of other Class 1 railroads, this sector has been under pressure since the East Palestine incident. This could ease in the future, providing a lift for all railroad stocks, NSC included.PayPal Holdings (PYPL)PayPal logo and front of headquarters. PYPL stockSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comThroughout 2022, I was quite critical of PayPal Holdings’ (NASDAQ:PYPL) merits as a strong investment opportunity. Thus far, in 2023, I have largely held the same view.While giving PYPL stock a B for earnings, overall shares continue to earn a D rating in Portfolio Grader. Growth challenges remain, considering the current economic slowdown, as well as competition from both old school and new school financial institutions.Yet if additional weakness results in PYPL re-hitting its 52-week low ($66.39 per share), at that point the stock might be back in the buy zone. Although multiple expansion is limited due to decelerating growth, if current cost-cutting efforts boost profitability in 2023 and 2024, it may be enough to drive a partial recovery.Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD)Toronto-Dominion (TD) Bank logo on buildingSource: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.comToronto-Dominion Bank (NYSE:TD) is another stock that earns a low D rating overall in Portfolio Grader, yet receives high marks (an A) regarding earnings. This may put shares in the Canada-based financial institution firmly in the second chance stocks category.Although TD stock has slid lower since reporting earnings earlier this month, Scotiabank analyst Meny Grauman believes this sell-off has been overdone.The latest numbers suggest that, despite rising interest rates, TD’s net interest margin (or NIM) is slowing down. This explains why the sell-side has trimmed its 2023 earnings forecasts. Interest rate trends remain favorable.A full year earnings beat for TD may remain in reach. In addition, if the overhang from its still-pending merger with First Horizon (NYSE:FHN) resolves, whether from the deal completing, or even from the deal getting scrapped, this too could give shares a boost.Verizon Communications (VZ)Verizon Wireless sign and trademark logo.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comVerizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) shares are down more than 30% over the past twelve months. The investors who bought the stock last year likely regret their decision.Despite a low valuation (7.5 times earnings), VZ has continued becoming cheaper. This has made it the quintessential “value trap.”With this in mind, it’s no mystery why I currently give VZ stock a D rating in Portfolio Grader. Admittedly though, it may not take much to change my view. I already give the telecommunications giant a high A grade for earnings. After walking back guidance for 2023, Verizon is in a strong position to exceed earnings expectations.That’s not all. More progress with the rollout of 5G is something else that could improve sentiment for VZ stock throughout the year. With plenty in play to improve sentiment for heavily discounted VZ stock, this is another name to add to the watchlist.On the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in DIS.

And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. To wit, the Visa share price has climbed 74% in five years, easily topping the market return of 34% (ignoring dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 11% in the last year , including dividends .While this past week has detracted from the company's five-year return, let's look at the recent trends of the underlying business and see if the gains have been in alignment. See our latest analysis for Visa While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, Visa managed to grow its earnings per share at 19% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 12% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Visa has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Visa, it has a TSR of 79% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Visa shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 11% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 12% per year, is even more impressive. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Visa better, we need to consider many other factors.

But in three years the returns have been great. In fact, the share price is up a full 106% compared to three years ago. It's not uncommon to see a share price retrace a bit, after a big gain. The fundamental business performance will ultimately dictate whether the top is in, or if this is a stellar buying opportunity.Since the long term performance has been good but there's been a recent pullback of 5.1%, let's check if the fundamentals match the share price. Check out our latest analysis for Genuine Parts While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Genuine Parts was able to grow its EPS at 24% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. We don't think it is entirely coincidental that the EPS growth is reasonably close to the 27% average annual increase in the share price. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Genuine Parts has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Genuine Parts will grow revenue in the future.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Genuine Parts the TSR over the last 3 years was 123%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Genuine Parts has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 37% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 16% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

Even after accounting for the recent loss, the US$498k worth of stock purchased by them is now worth US$578k or in other words, their investment continues to give good returns.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for ONEOK ONEOK Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by President Pierce Norton for US$498k worth of shares, at about US$55.54 per share. Although we like to see insider buying, we note that this large purchase was at significantly below the recent price of US$64.40. While it does suggest insiders consider the stock undervalued at lower prices, this transaction doesn't tell us much about what they think of current prices.The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeThere are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Does ONEOK Boast High Insider Ownership?I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. ONEOK insiders own 0.7% of the company, currently worth about US$194m based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About ONEOK Insiders?The fact that there have been no ONEOK insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. However, our analysis of transactions over the last year is heartening. Judging from their transactions, and high insider ownership, ONEOK insiders feel good about the company's future. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. For example, ONEOK has 2 warning signs (and 1 which is significant) we think you should know about.Story continuesOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

Fundamentally, companies that provide passive income to their stakeholders tend to weather down cycles better than their growth-centric counterparts. Mainly, this is because dividends come from profits – and profitable enterprises tend to enjoy well-established businesses.Another factor that will benefit dividend stocks to buy centers on economic realities. Recently, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testified before Congress, opening the door for more and quicker-paced rate hikes. Naturally, the rise in borrowing costs will impose headwinds on growth enterprises. And while dividend payers will suffer too, they should be able to ride the storm better. Finally, to ramp up the probabilities of success, all of the market ideas below enjoy analyst price targets that imply double-digit gains. Therefore, these dividend stocks to buy play both sides of the profitability aisle.RBARitchie Bros Auctioneers$60.09DOXAmdocs$91.10DEDeere$424.29PSAPublic Storage$300.87CSCOCisco$49.11GRMNGarmin$98.13KELYAKelly Services$16.98InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDividend Stocks to Buy: Ritchie Bros Auctioneers (RBA)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comA global asset management and disposition company, Ritchie Bros Auctioneers (NYSE:RBA) offers customers end-to-end solutions for buying and selling used heavy equipment, trucks, and other assets in numerous industries. On the surface, the troubled global economy might seem to imply a poor performance for RBA. However, the stock gained nearly 7% of equity value in the trailing year.Interestingly, RBA offers an enticing financial profile. Operationally, its three-year revenue growth rate of 10% and a net margin of 18.17% rank within the top 30% of the underlying sector. Also, the company’s price-earnings-growth (PEG) ratio sits at 0.95 times. In contrast, the industry median pings at 1.56 times. In terms of passive income, Ritchie isn’t the most generous with a forward yield of 1.8%. However, its payout ratio sits at 38.93%, presenting confidence for sustainability.Story continuesFinally, Wall Street analysts peg RBA as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $66.60, implying nearly 11% upside potential. Thus, it’s one of the dividend stocks to buy.Dividend Stocks to Buy: Amdocs (DOX)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comA multinational corporation, Amdocs (NASDAQ:DOX) specializes in software and services for communications, media, and financial services providers and digital enterprises. So far this year, DOX encountered some choppy waters, dipping down almost 2%. However, in the past 365 days, DOX returned shareholders nearly 15% of equity value.As with Ritchie, Amdocs presents some attractive fiscal attributes. Perhaps most notably, DOX enjoys an objectively undervalued profile. Presently, the market prices DOX at a trailing multiple of 20.3. As a discount to earnings, Amdocs ranks better than 61.4% of the competition. In addition, shares trade at a forward multiple of 16. In contrast, the sector median value stands at 24.39. Presently, Amdocs carries a forward yield of 1.93%. Its payout ratio sits below 27%, facilitating confidence regarding yield sustainability.Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg DOX as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target pings at $99.75, implying almost 11% upside potential. This too attracts as one of the dividend stocks to buy.Dividend Stocks to Buy: Deere (DE)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockA manufacturer of agricultural machinery and heavy equipment, Deere (NYSE:DE) represents a critical tangential component of national infrastructure. Further, with greater emphasis on core needs such as farming, DE ranks among the most relevant dividend stocks to buy. It’s also a strong performer in the charts. In the past 365 days, DE returned stakeholders almost 15% of equity value.Overall, this fairly valued enterprise should appeal both for its burgeoning narrative and its operational dominance. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 11.7%, outpacing 77.35% of its peers. Also, its book growth rate during the same period pings at 23%, above nearly 90% of the industry.To be fair, the less-than-appealing side for Deere is its passive income. With a forward yield of 1.2%, it’s not the most generous company. However, its payout ratio is only 15.63%, so it can deliver on this passive income convincingly. But don’t go away yet. Analysts peg DE as a consensus moderate buy. As well, their average price target is $472.33, implying 13% upside potential.Public Storage (PSA)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockA self-explanatory business, Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) owns self-storage facilities throughout the U.S. The company structures itself as a real estate investment trust (REIT). Fundamentally, Public Storage addresses the needs of baby boomers looking to downsize but keep certain items. As well, it offers solutions for millennials also looking to downsize to save on escalated residential rents.To be sure, PSA rates as a more volatile investment among dividend stocks to buy, shedding nearly 18% of value in the trailing year. However, it also might make for an undervalued opportunity. According to Gurufocus.com’s discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, PSA’s fair value comes out to $488.50. However, the stock’s time-of-writing price sits at $302.35. At the moment, Public Storage carries a forward yield of 3.97%. While more generous than many other companies, its payout ratio is 96.4%. Therefore, caution is warranted. Still, covering analysts peg PSA as a consensus moderate buy. Moreover, their average price target stands at $348, implying 15% upside potential.Cisco (CSCO)Glass jar of coins marked ""dividends"" to represent dividend stocks. stocks with dividendsSource: ShutterstockA multinational digital communications technology firm, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) develops, manufactures, and sells networking hardware, software, telecommunications equipment, and other high-technology services and products. It’s a powerhouse in specialized tech markets such as the Internet of Things. However, it does rank as one of the higher-risk, higher-reward dividend stocks to buy.In the trailing year, CSCO dropped 10% in equity value. Still, this underperformance probably represents a buy-the-dip opportunity. In the trailing five years, shares gained nearly 8%. Looking at the financials, Cisco benefits from outstanding profit margins. As well, CSCO trades at a forward multiple of 13. As a discount to earnings, Cisco ranks better than 61.63% of the competition. In terms of passive income, Cisco offers a forward yield of 3.19%. Further, its payout ratio is only 38.69%, affording credibility and confidence. Looking to Wall Street, covering analysts peg CSCO as a consensus moderate buy. Moreover, their average price target stands at $56.88, implying over 16% upside potential.Garmin (GRMN)7 Winning High-Yield Dividend Stocks With Payouts Over 5%Source: ShutterstockA multinational tech firm, Garmin (NYSE:GRMN) specializes in GPS technology for automotive, aviation, marine, outdoor, and sports activities. Furthermore, the company invested heavily in wearable technologies such as activity trackers and smartwatches. Since the Jan. opener, GRMN posted a decent performance, gaining 5% of equity value. However, in the past 365 days, it’s down almost 11%.According to Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value (FMV), Garmin represents a modestly undervalued investment. For me, the operational strengths distinguish themselves. As an example, its three-year book growth rate stands at 8.8%, outpacing 63.45% of the field. Also, the company’s net margin is 20%, above 92.38% of sector peers.Right now, the company carries a forward yield of 2.97%. Its payout ratio of 51.48% is a bit elevated but still a decent sustainable figure. Lastly, covering analysts peg GRMN as a consensus moderate buy. As well, their average price target stands at $119, implying 21% upside potential. Therefore, it’s an enticing candidate for dividend stocks to buy.Kelly Services (KELYA)7 Winning High-Yield Dividend Stocks With Payouts Over 5%Source: ShutterstockAn American office staffing company, Kelly Services (NASDAQ:KELYA) also operates globally. Fundamentally, with mass layoffs accelerating, Kelly Services offers natural relevancies. As well, the company doesn’t just focus on white-collar work but also warehouse opportunities. You never know – office worker bees might get tired of sitting in front of a computer all day.To be fair, though, prospective investors will need patience with KELYA. In the past 365 days, shares dropped over 12% in equity value. However, it’s also objectively undervalued. Presently, KELYA trades at a forward multiple of 10.93. As a discount to earnings, Kelly Services ranks better than 70.19% of its rivals. Also, the market prices KELYA at 0.13 times trailing sales. In contrast, the sector median value is 1.18 times. Currently, Kelly carries a forward yield of 1.78%. Though a bit low, its payout ratio sits at 16.85%, giving stakeholders plenty of confidence.Finally, the big reason to consider KELYA as one of the dividend stocks to buy. Analysts anticipate shares hitting $24, implying upside potential of over 42%.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

(NASDAQ:MU)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/declining-stock-decent-financials-market-134503106.html,1678542303,STORY,['MU'],"[It is hard to get excited after looking at Micron Technology's (NASDAQ:MU) recent performance, when its stock has declined 8.7% over the past month. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financials over the long term, which in this case look pretty respectable. Specifically, we decided to study Micron Technology's  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Micron Technology How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Micron Technology is:13% = US$6.2b ÷ US$49b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.13 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Micron Technology's Earnings Growth And 13% ROETo start with, Micron Technology's ROE looks acceptable. Even so, when compared with the average industry ROE of 19%, we aren't very excited. Further research shows that Micron Technology's net income has shrunk at a rate of 14% over the last five years. Bear in mind, the company does have a high ROE. It is just that the industry ROE is higher. So there might be other reasons for the earnings to shrink. These include low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital.Story continuesHowever, when we compared Micron Technology's growth with the industry we found that while the company's earnings have been shrinking, the industry has seen an earnings growth of 28% in the same period. This is quite worrisome.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about Micron Technology's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is Micron Technology Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?When we piece together Micron Technology's low three-year median payout ratio of 4.2% (where it is retaining 96% of its profits), calculated for the last three-year period, we are puzzled by the lack of growth. The low payout should mean that the company is retaining most of its earnings and consequently, should see some growth. It looks like there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.Only recently, Micron Technology stated paying a dividend. This likely means that the management might have concluded that its shareholders have a strong preference for dividends. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 10% over the next three years. Despite the higher expected payout ratio, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much.SummaryIn total, it does look like Micron Technology has some positive aspects to its business. Although, we are disappointed to see a lack of growth in earnings even in spite of a moderate ROE and and a high reinvestment rate. We believe that there might be some outside factors that could be having a negative impact on the business. That being so, the latest industry analyst forecasts show that the analysts are expecting to see a huge improvement in the company's earnings growth rate.

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 65% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's market cap fell by US$10.0b last week. Still, the 0.07% one-year gains may have helped mitigate their overall losses. We would assume however, that they would be on the lookout for weakness in the future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of American Express, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for American Express ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About American Express?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.American Express already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at American Express' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in American Express. Our data shows that Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is the largest shareholder with 20% of shares outstanding. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 6.4% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 6.1% of the company stock.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 13 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of American ExpressThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of American Express Company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$170m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 15% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Public Company OwnershipWe can see that public companies hold 20% of the American Express shares on issue. We can't be certain but it is quite possible this is a strategic stake. The businesses may be similar, or work together.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand American Express better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should be aware of the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with American Express .If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

The global leader in flavor is battling supply chain-related issues.The factors mentioned above affected McCormick’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results, with the top and the bottom line declining year over year and missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Shares of the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company have slumped 16.3% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 6.5% decline.Let’s delve deeper.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDismal Q4 TrendsIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, Quarterly adjusted earnings of 73 cents per share declined from 84 cents in the year-ago quarter. The company’s sales of $1,695.7 million declined 2%. Results were impacted by the Kitchen Basics divestiture, reduced consumption in China due to the pandemic and cost inflation, among other factors.In the fiscal fourth quarter, McCormick’s Consumer sales went down 8% to $1,037.8 million, and constant currency (cc) sales fell 4% due to soft volumes and mix. These were somewhat compensated by pricing actions across all three regions. The volume decline included the adverse impacts of the Kitchen Basics divestiture, reduced consumption in China due to the pandemic and the exit of a low-margin business across India and the Consumer business in Russia.Margin PressureMcCormick has been grappling with cost inflation for a while now. During fourth-quarter fiscal 2022, the company’s adjusted gross profit margin contracted 410 basis points to 36.8% due to escalated cost inflation, higher other supply-chain expenses and an adverse product mix. During the fiscal fourth quarter, operating income was $264 million, down from the $276 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The downside was caused by gross margin contraction, mainly in the Flavor Solutions unit. The adjusted operating income fell from $309 million to $278 million.Story continuesSupply Chain BottlenecksDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, McCormick continued to witness supply chain-related issues. In its last earnings call, management highlighted that it witnessed reduced operating leverage in the Consumer segment during the quarter. In the Flavor unit, the company has been witnessing dual running costs in the Flavor Solutions segment as it transitions production to the new UK Peterborough production unit. In addition, McCormick continues to incur escalated costs to meet the high demand in various parts of the business.Wrapping UpMcCormick is on track to capitalize on a sustained shift to cooking more at home, higher digital engagement, clean and flavorful eating and trusted brands. The company regularly enhances products through innovation to remain competitive and tap the evolving demand. Management is on track with cost savings and enhancing productivity.That being said, let’s see if these upsides can help McCormick counter the aforementioned hurdles.Looking for Better-Ranked Food Bets?

74,9020569b-fd1a-3acf-a644-c0848801268c,MDLZ,2023-03-12,7 Food Stocks to Buy as Shortages Hit Consumers,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-food-stocks-buy-shortages-185529135.html,1678215329,STORY,"['TWNK', 'NOMD', 'MDLZ', 'COST', 'LW', 'KR', 'FREE']","[Aside from inflation and military conflict, one of the most-discussed topics centers on global food shortages, thus cynically incentivizing food stocks to buy. Predominantly, Russia’s unjustified invasion of Ukraine dramatically disrupted critical supply chains, resulting in price escalation. In turn, crises throughout the world may turn worryingly volatile as desperate nations become even more so.To be sure, acquiring food stocks to buy won’t solve any of the root problems associated with sector shortages. However, it appears almost inevitable that food prices – along with associated value chains – will swing higher. Therefore, moving ahead of this wave could shield your portfolio from subsequent inflation. Finally, enterprises linked to necessary resources enjoy established frameworks. No, they’re not particularly exciting but they get the job done. And that’s really all you can ask for during these trying times. With that, below are the food stocks to buy as shortages hit consumers.LWLamb Weston$101.23KRKroger$46.78TWNKHostess Brands$24.12COSTCostco$487.62MDLZMondelez$64.49NOMDNomad Foods$17.35FREEWhole Earth Brands$2.98InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLamb Weston (LW)man's hand holding wads of cashSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comA food processing firm, Lamb Weston (NYSE:LW) is one of the world’s largest producers of frozen French fries, waffle fries, and other frozen potato products. Fundamentally, Lamb Weston attracts investors because as inflation hits consumers, they’ll likely look for cheaper sources of nourishment. Potatoes can fill up a hungry stomach, making LW an intriguing prospect for food stocks to buy.It appears that investors have taken note. Since the start of the year, LW gained nearly 17% of its equity value. And in the trailing year, shares nearly doubled. On paper, then, LW appears to be overvalued, both against trailing and forward earnings. As well, investment resource Gurufocus.com warns readers that it might be modestly overvalued.Story continuesThat said, Lamb Weston enjoys strong profitability metrics. In particular, its net margin stands at 10.5%, outpacing 80.46% of the industry. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg LW as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target stands at $111, implying nearly 9% upside potential.Kroger (KR)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockA favorite topic when it comes to food stocks to buy, Kroger (NYSE:KR) brings much fundamental (i.e. narrative) value to the table. Primarily, Kroger – which operates supermarkets and multi-department stores – benefits from the trade-down effect. Basically, consumers will trade down from eating out at fine-dining establishments to cooking at home. Naturally, this benefits KR stock.Not surprisingly, after some choppiness in recent months, the bulls have entered the space. Since the January opener, KR gained 4.5% of its equity value. Financially as well, Kroger offers an attractive profile. Mainly, the market prices KR at a forward multiple of 11.02. As a discount to earnings, the company ranks better than 83.61% of the competition.Operationally, Kroger enjoys a decent sales trajectory, with a three-year revenue growth rate of 6.4%. This stat ranks above nearly 60% of its rivals. Also, it enjoys a return on equity (ROE) of 24.57%, indicating a high-quality business.Presently, Wall Street analysts peg KR as a consensus hold. Nevertheless, their average price target stands at $52.07, implying 12% upside potential. Therefore, it’s one of the food stocks to buy.Hostess Brands (TWNK)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comAt first glance, the inclusion of Hostess Brands (NASDAQ:TWNK) – the owner of the Twinkies brand – on a list of food stocks to buy might seem odd. However, it makes perfect sense on many levels. First and foremost, Twinkies offer cheap sustenance (I didn’t say they were healthy, to be clear). And second, they represent comfort food.Indeed, Hostess’ leadership team noted that millennials turn to Twinkies to help manage their stress. Sure enough, investors have taken notice of the upside opportunity. Since the start of the year, TWNK gained slightly over 9% of equity value. In the past 365 days, it returned 11%.Financially, given the recent momentum, TWNK might be a tad bit overvalued against trailing earnings. That said, it delivers solid operational strengths. For instance, Hostess’ three-year EBITDA growth rate stands at 28.3%, outpacing 80% of its peers. And its net margin dominates at 12.09%, above 84% of the industry. Lastly, Wall Street analysts peg TWNK as a consensus moderate buy. In addition, their average price target stands at $27.40, implying nearly 13% upside potential.Costco (COST)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Specializing in open-warehouse style membership-only retailers, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) isn’t a direct player among food stocks to buy. Nevertheless, it plays a significant role in the consumer economy as households adjust to higher prices. Essentially, Costco incentivizes purchasing products in bulk, one of the best ways to mitigate accelerating inflation.Additionally, Costco caters to a wealthier customer base. Because of the implied economic insulation, investors started to eyeball COST stock. Since the Jan. opener, shares bounced up almost 7%. However, it’s down nearly 9% in the trailing year, presenting a relative discount.Financially, COST appears to be overpriced at the moment, thus requiring patience. Still, Costco enjoys a robust balance sheet. As well, it benefits from significant operational strengths. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 14%, above 84.51% of the competition. Also, its book growth rate during the same period is 10.4%, outpacing 66.79% of the field.Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg COST as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $552.76, implying over 14% upside potential.Mondelez International (MDLZ)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comA multinational food company, Mondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ) mainly specializes in confectionaries. Here, the company may benefit from the trade-down effect. As inflation crimps the consumer economy, people may opt for cheaper fares (compared to patronizing coffee shops, for example). As well, Mondelez manufactures beverages and various snacks.Overall, MDLZ has been a steady performer among food stocks to buy. Since the start of the new year, MDLZ slipped about 1%. However, in the past 365 days, MDLZ gained 5%. This actually compares very favorably to the S&amp;P 500 index, which dipped almost 4% during the same period.Operationally, Mondelez’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 8.6%, above 64.86% of sector peers. Also, its net margin over the trailing year is 8.63%, ranked better than 76% of the competition. Looking to the Street, covering analysts peg MDLZ as a strong buy. Also, their average price target pings at $75.19, implying over 14% upside potential.Nomad Foods (NOMD)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comDiving into the speculative portion of food stocks to buy, Nomad Foods (NYSE:NOMD) is a U.K.-headquartered frozen food company. Again, it’s quite possible that Nomad over the long run may benefit from the trade-down effect. Assuming economic conditions worsen, people will have less incentive to go out and eat/drink. Therefore, cheap frozen meals start to look rather enticing (again, not discussing the health component).However, it’s a risky narrative. Since the Jan. opener, NOMD dipped a bit below parity. In the trailing year, shares plunged almost 18%. On the financials, Gurufocus.com warns that it’s a possible value trap. So, it’s only one of the food stocks to buy if you can stomach possible volatility.Nevertheless, Nomad’s three-year revenue growth rate is 11.1%, above 71.17% of the industry. Further, its net margin comes in at 8.45%, above over 75% of the field. As well, the market prices NOMD at 11 times forward earnings, ranking better than 74.45% of its competitors. Finally, covering analysts peg NOMD as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target stands at $21.63, implying over 23% upside potential.Whole Earth Brands (FREE)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comBilled as a global food company enabling healthier lifestyles, Whole Earth Brands (NASDAQ:FREE) fundamentally benefits from young consumers’ push toward healthier eating choices. Moreover, for those who have been spared the mass layoffs that have been occurring over the past year, Whole Earth offers premium nutrition while still enjoying a sizable discount compared to eating out.However, it’s an incredibly risky narrative. Since the January opener, FREE plunged more than 25% in equity value. In the past 365 days, shares slipped almost 66%. Not shockingly, Gurufocus.com warns its readers that Whole Earth is a possible value trap.Still, Whole Earth does feature some attractive figures. For instance, its three-year sales growth rate is 16.9%, above 83.26% of the competition. And for what it’s worth, the market prices FREE at a forward multiple of 7.63. In contrast, the sector median pings at 16.81. Lastly, Ryan Meyers of Lake Street assigned a buy rating on FREE with a price target of $8. This implies over 162% upside potential.

75,37ca31f2-be4e-3b95-b429-e5873a72525b,OXY,2023-03-12,A Look At The Fair Value Of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-fair-value-occidental-petroleum-110021870.html,1678618821,STORY,['OXY'],"[Key InsightsOccidental Petroleum's estimated fair value is US$60.11 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityWith US$59.86 share price, Occidental Petroleum appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value The US$71.81 analyst price target for OXY is 19% more than our estimate of fair valueDoes the March share price for Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum What's The Estimated Valuation?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$8.70bUS$7.37bUS$5.92bUS$5.13bUS$4.68bUS$4.42bUS$4.28bUS$4.21bUS$4.18bUS$4.19bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x5Analyst x2Est @ -13.41%Est @ -8.77%Est @ -5.52%Est @ -3.24%Est @ -1.65%Est @ -0.53%Est @ 0.25% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 10% US$7.9kUS$6.1kUS$4.4kUS$3.5kUS$2.9kUS$2.5kUS$2.2kUS$1.9kUS$1.7kUS$1.6k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$35bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 10%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.2b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (10%– 2.1%) = US$52bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$52b÷ ( 1 + 10%)10= US$20bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$54b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$59.9, the company appears about fair value at a 0.4% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Occidental Petroleum as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 10%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.383. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Occidental PetroleumStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Oil and Gas market.OpportunityGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Vertex Pharmaceuticals with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Vertex Pharmaceuticals How Quickly Is Vertex Pharmaceuticals Increasing Earnings Per Share?If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Vertex Pharmaceuticals' shareholders have have plenty to be happy about as their annual EPS growth for the last 3 years was 41%. Growth that fast may well be fleeting, but it should be more than enough to pique the interest of the wary stock pickers.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. While Vertex Pharmaceuticals did well to grow revenue over the last year, EBIT margins were dampened at the same time. So if EBIT margins can stabilize, this top-line growth should pay off for shareholders.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyWhile we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for Vertex Pharmaceuticals?Story continuesAre Vertex Pharmaceuticals Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Vertex Pharmaceuticals, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$187m. We note that this amounts to 0.3% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Vertex Pharmaceuticals but it's still worth mentioning. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.Does Vertex Pharmaceuticals Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?Vertex Pharmaceuticals' earnings per share have been soaring, with growth rates sky high. That EPS growth certainly is attention grabbing, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke our interest. At times fast EPS growth is a sign the business has reached an inflection point, so there's a potential opportunity to be had here. So based on this quick analysis, we do think it's worth considering Vertex Pharmaceuticals for a spot on your watchlist. While we've looked at the quality of the earnings, we haven't yet done any work to value the stock. So if you like to buy cheap, you may want to check if Vertex Pharmaceuticals is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

Fundamentally, companies that provide passive income to their stakeholders tend to weather down cycles better than their growth-centric counterparts. Mainly, this is because dividends come from profits – and profitable enterprises tend to enjoy well-established businesses.Another factor that will benefit dividend stocks to buy centers on economic realities. Recently, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testified before Congress, opening the door for more and quicker-paced rate hikes. Naturally, the rise in borrowing costs will impose headwinds on growth enterprises. And while dividend payers will suffer too, they should be able to ride the storm better. Finally, to ramp up the probabilities of success, all of the market ideas below enjoy analyst price targets that imply double-digit gains. Therefore, these dividend stocks to buy play both sides of the profitability aisle.RBARitchie Bros Auctioneers$60.09DOXAmdocs$91.10DEDeere$424.29PSAPublic Storage$300.87CSCOCisco$49.11GRMNGarmin$98.13KELYAKelly Services$16.98InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDividend Stocks to Buy: Ritchie Bros Auctioneers (RBA)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comA global asset management and disposition company, Ritchie Bros Auctioneers (NYSE:RBA) offers customers end-to-end solutions for buying and selling used heavy equipment, trucks, and other assets in numerous industries. On the surface, the troubled global economy might seem to imply a poor performance for RBA. However, the stock gained nearly 7% of equity value in the trailing year.Interestingly, RBA offers an enticing financial profile. Operationally, its three-year revenue growth rate of 10% and a net margin of 18.17% rank within the top 30% of the underlying sector. Also, the company’s price-earnings-growth (PEG) ratio sits at 0.95 times. In contrast, the industry median pings at 1.56 times. In terms of passive income, Ritchie isn’t the most generous with a forward yield of 1.8%. However, its payout ratio sits at 38.93%, presenting confidence for sustainability.Story continuesFinally, Wall Street analysts peg RBA as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $66.60, implying nearly 11% upside potential. Thus, it’s one of the dividend stocks to buy.Dividend Stocks to Buy: Amdocs (DOX)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comA multinational corporation, Amdocs (NASDAQ:DOX) specializes in software and services for communications, media, and financial services providers and digital enterprises. So far this year, DOX encountered some choppy waters, dipping down almost 2%. However, in the past 365 days, DOX returned shareholders nearly 15% of equity value.As with Ritchie, Amdocs presents some attractive fiscal attributes. Perhaps most notably, DOX enjoys an objectively undervalued profile. Presently, the market prices DOX at a trailing multiple of 20.3. As a discount to earnings, Amdocs ranks better than 61.4% of the competition. In addition, shares trade at a forward multiple of 16. In contrast, the sector median value stands at 24.39. Presently, Amdocs carries a forward yield of 1.93%. Its payout ratio sits below 27%, facilitating confidence regarding yield sustainability.Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg DOX as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target pings at $99.75, implying almost 11% upside potential. This too attracts as one of the dividend stocks to buy.Dividend Stocks to Buy: Deere (DE)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockA manufacturer of agricultural machinery and heavy equipment, Deere (NYSE:DE) represents a critical tangential component of national infrastructure. Further, with greater emphasis on core needs such as farming, DE ranks among the most relevant dividend stocks to buy. It’s also a strong performer in the charts. In the past 365 days, DE returned stakeholders almost 15% of equity value.Overall, this fairly valued enterprise should appeal both for its burgeoning narrative and its operational dominance. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 11.7%, outpacing 77.35% of its peers. Also, its book growth rate during the same period pings at 23%, above nearly 90% of the industry.To be fair, the less-than-appealing side for Deere is its passive income. With a forward yield of 1.2%, it’s not the most generous company. However, its payout ratio is only 15.63%, so it can deliver on this passive income convincingly. But don’t go away yet. Analysts peg DE as a consensus moderate buy. As well, their average price target is $472.33, implying 13% upside potential.Public Storage (PSA)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockA self-explanatory business, Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) owns self-storage facilities throughout the U.S. The company structures itself as a real estate investment trust (REIT). Fundamentally, Public Storage addresses the needs of baby boomers looking to downsize but keep certain items. As well, it offers solutions for millennials also looking to downsize to save on escalated residential rents.To be sure, PSA rates as a more volatile investment among dividend stocks to buy, shedding nearly 18% of value in the trailing year. However, it also might make for an undervalued opportunity. According to Gurufocus.com’s discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, PSA’s fair value comes out to $488.50. However, the stock’s time-of-writing price sits at $302.35. At the moment, Public Storage carries a forward yield of 3.97%. While more generous than many other companies, its payout ratio is 96.4%. Therefore, caution is warranted. Still, covering analysts peg PSA as a consensus moderate buy. Moreover, their average price target stands at $348, implying 15% upside potential.Cisco (CSCO)Glass jar of coins marked ""dividends"" to represent dividend stocks. stocks with dividendsSource: ShutterstockA multinational digital communications technology firm, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) develops, manufactures, and sells networking hardware, software, telecommunications equipment, and other high-technology services and products. It’s a powerhouse in specialized tech markets such as the Internet of Things. However, it does rank as one of the higher-risk, higher-reward dividend stocks to buy.In the trailing year, CSCO dropped 10% in equity value. Still, this underperformance probably represents a buy-the-dip opportunity. In the trailing five years, shares gained nearly 8%. Looking at the financials, Cisco benefits from outstanding profit margins. As well, CSCO trades at a forward multiple of 13. As a discount to earnings, Cisco ranks better than 61.63% of the competition. In terms of passive income, Cisco offers a forward yield of 3.19%. Further, its payout ratio is only 38.69%, affording credibility and confidence. Looking to Wall Street, covering analysts peg CSCO as a consensus moderate buy. Moreover, their average price target stands at $56.88, implying over 16% upside potential.Garmin (GRMN)7 Winning High-Yield Dividend Stocks With Payouts Over 5%Source: ShutterstockA multinational tech firm, Garmin (NYSE:GRMN) specializes in GPS technology for automotive, aviation, marine, outdoor, and sports activities. Furthermore, the company invested heavily in wearable technologies such as activity trackers and smartwatches. Since the Jan. opener, GRMN posted a decent performance, gaining 5% of equity value. However, in the past 365 days, it’s down almost 11%.According to Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value (FMV), Garmin represents a modestly undervalued investment. For me, the operational strengths distinguish themselves. As an example, its three-year book growth rate stands at 8.8%, outpacing 63.45% of the field. Also, the company’s net margin is 20%, above 92.38% of sector peers.Right now, the company carries a forward yield of 2.97%. Its payout ratio of 51.48% is a bit elevated but still a decent sustainable figure. Lastly, covering analysts peg GRMN as a consensus moderate buy. As well, their average price target stands at $119, implying 21% upside potential. Therefore, it’s an enticing candidate for dividend stocks to buy.Kelly Services (KELYA)7 Winning High-Yield Dividend Stocks With Payouts Over 5%Source: ShutterstockAn American office staffing company, Kelly Services (NASDAQ:KELYA) also operates globally. Fundamentally, with mass layoffs accelerating, Kelly Services offers natural relevancies. As well, the company doesn’t just focus on white-collar work but also warehouse opportunities. You never know – office worker bees might get tired of sitting in front of a computer all day.To be fair, though, prospective investors will need patience with KELYA. In the past 365 days, shares dropped over 12% in equity value. However, it’s also objectively undervalued. Presently, KELYA trades at a forward multiple of 10.93. As a discount to earnings, Kelly Services ranks better than 70.19% of its rivals. Also, the market prices KELYA at 0.13 times trailing sales. In contrast, the sector median value is 1.18 times. Currently, Kelly carries a forward yield of 1.78%. Though a bit low, its payout ratio sits at 16.85%, giving stakeholders plenty of confidence.Finally, the big reason to consider KELYA as one of the dividend stocks to buy. Analysts anticipate shares hitting $24, implying upside potential of over 42%.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.
