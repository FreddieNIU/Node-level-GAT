But over three years, the returns would have left most investors smiling After all, the share price is up a market-beating 52% in that time.Since it's been a strong week for Charles Schwab shareholders, let's have a look at trend of the longer term fundamentals. Check out our latest analysis for Charles Schwab To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Charles Schwab was able to grow its EPS at 14% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. We don't think it is entirely coincidental that the EPS growth is reasonably close to the 15% average annual increase in the share price. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Charles Schwab's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Charles Schwab's TSR for the last 3 years was 58%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 0.8% in the last year, Charles Schwab shareholders lost 22% (even including dividends). However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 1.9% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this company have returned -3.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.1% change. The Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, to which The Charles Schwab Corporation belongs, has lost 3.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, The Charles Schwab Corporation is expected to post earnings of $0.79 per share, indicating a change of -18.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -9.1% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.36 points to a change of -13.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -9.5%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.26 indicates a change of +26.8% from what The Charles Schwab Corporation is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -9.7%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, The Charles Schwab Corporation is rated Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for SCHW _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For The Charles Schwab Corporation, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $4.77 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -6.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $19.56 billion and $22.06 billion estimates indicate -5.8% and +12.8% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryThe Charles Schwab Corporation reported revenues of $5.12 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +9.5%. EPS of $0.93 for the same period compares with $0.77 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.18 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.15%. The EPS surprise was +3.33%.Over the last four quarters, The Charles Schwab Corporation surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.The Charles Schwab Corporation is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about The Charles Schwab Corporation. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. So, when we ran our eye over Texas Instruments' (NASDAQ:TXN) trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Texas Instruments:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.36 = US$9.4b ÷ (US$29b - US$2.9b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Thus, Texas Instruments has an ROCE of 36%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Semiconductor industry average of 13%. View our latest analysis for Texas Instruments roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Texas Instruments compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.So How Is Texas Instruments' ROCE Trending?In terms of Texas Instruments' history of ROCE, it's quite impressive. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 36% and the business has deployed 68% more capital into its operations. Returns like this are the envy of most businesses and given it has repeatedly reinvested at these rates, that's even better. If these trends can continue, it wouldn't surprise us if the company became a multi-bagger.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Texas Instruments' ROCEIn short, we'd argue Texas Instruments has the makings of a multi-bagger since its been able to compound its capital at very profitable rates of return. And since the stock has risen strongly over the last five years, it appears the market might expect this trend to continue. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we still believe the stock deserves further research.If you want to know some of the risks facing Texas Instruments we've found 2 warning signs (1 is concerning!) that you should be aware of before investing here.If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?

Both companies are struggling with falling demand and oversupply in the market. This has led to declining prices and profit margins for flash memory makers, prompting consolidation moves, such as the proposed merger between Kioxia and Western Digital.The merger between Kioxia and Western Digital aims to increase their competitiveness against rivals, such as Samsung Electronics, added Reuters. Citing sources familiar with the matter, Reuters notes that Kioxia will hold 43% of the merged entity, Western Digital will be holding 37%, and existing shareholders will hold the remaining shares under the proposed merger structure.

Under the SID, it will acquire 100% of the issued share capital in Newcrest under an Australian court-approved Scheme of Arrangement.Newcrest shareholders will get 0.400 Newmont shares for each Newcrest share, as well as a special dividend of up to $1.10 per share paid by Newcrest, representing a 30.4% premium. The payment of the special dividend is conditional on the scheme becoming effective. The deal, which gives Newcrest an implied enterprise value of A$28.8 billion (roughly $19.2 billion), is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2023. Shareholders of Newmont and Newcrest will own roughly 69% and 31% of the combined entity, respectively, following the scheme's implementation.The union of Newmont and Newcrest delivers an extraordinary value proposition for shareholders and other stakeholders, NEM noted. It establishes an industry-leading portfolio with a multi-decade gold and copper production profile in the most favorable mining jurisdictions in the world. The acquisition boosts Newmont's annual copper output - a critical commodity for the new energy economy - and adds almost 50 billion pounds of copper reserves and resources from Newcrest to its strong and well-balanced portfolio.This acquisition is expected to result in a world-class portfolio of assets, primarily in favorable, low-risk mining jurisdictions, with the largest concentration of Tier 1 operations. With this portfolio, Newmont will be well-placed to create strong, consistent and long-term returns while achieving best-in-class sustainability performance in the future. The portfolio is expected to deliver around 8 million ounces of combined annual gold production upon the transaction closure and combined annual copper production of approximately 350 million pounds from Australia and Canada.Newmont has identified the potential for significant synergies, with $500 million in total annual pre-tax benefits expected within the first 24 months of the transaction's completion. Pre-tax general and administrative synergies of around $100 million, generated by Newmont's scalable, integrated operating model with existing regional teams in Australia and Canada, will likely be achieved.Supply chain synergies of roughly $200 million are also expected from best-in-class pricing and existing strong partnerships with key suppliers, smelters and equipment manufacturers due to exceptional economies of scale. At least $200 million of benefits are also anticipated from Newmont's proven “Full Potential” continuous improvement program, which reduces costs and increases productivity by rapidly replicating leading processes and advanced technology.Story continuesPrice PerformanceNEM’s shares are down 28.1% over a year, underperforming the industry’s decline of 11.8%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNewmont, on its first-quarter call said that it is on track to meet its attributable gold production projection of 5.7-6.3 million ounces for 2023.

It is preferred by many investors while handpicking stocks trading at a bargain. However, even this straightforward, broadly used valuation metric has a few downsides.While P/E is the most popular valuation metric, a more complicated multiple called EV-to-EBITDA works even better. Often considered a better alternative to P/E, it gives the true picture of a company’s valuation and earnings potential, and has a more complete approach to valuation. While P/E considers a firm’s equity portion, EV-to-EBITDA determines its total value.Unum Group UNM, M/I Homes, Inc. MHO, UFP Industries, Inc. UFPI, Park Hotels &amp; Resorts Inc. PK and Group 1 Automotive, Inc. GPI are some stocks with impressive EV-to-EBITDA ratios.What Makes EV-to-EBITDA a Better Alternative?Also referred to as enterprise multiple, EV-to-EBITDA is the enterprise value (EV) of a stock divided by its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). EV is the sum of a company’s market capitalization, its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents. In essence, it is the entire value of a company.EBITDA, the other element, gives a clearer picture of a company’s profitability as it removes the impact of non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that dampen net earnings. It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows.Typically, the lower the EV-to-EBITDA ratio, the more enticing it is. A low EV-to-EBITDA ratio could indicate that a stock is potentially undervalued.  Unlike the P/E ratio, EV-to-EBITDA takes debt on a company’s balance sheet into account. For this reason, it is typically used to value acquisition targets. The ratio shows the amount of debt that the acquirer has to bear. Stocks flaunting a low EV-to-EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates.Moreover, P/E can’t be used to value a loss-making firm. A firm’s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. In contrast, EV-to-EBITDA is harder to manipulate and can be used to value companies that have negative net earnings but are positive on the EBITDA front.EV-to-EBITDA is also a useful yardstick in evaluating the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation. Moreover, it can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt.But EV-to-EBITDA has its limitations too. The ratio varies across industries (a high-growth industry typically has a higher multiple and vice versa) and is usually not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries, given their diverse capital requirements.As such, a strategy solely based on EV-to-EBITDA might not yield the desired results. But you can club it with the other major ratios in your stock-investing toolbox, such as price-to-book (P/B), P/E and price-to-sales (P/S) to screen bargain stocks.Story continuesScreening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for bargain stocks:EV-to-EBITDA 12 Months-Most Recent less than X-Industry Median: A lower EV-to-EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation.P/E using (F1) less than X-Industry Median: This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers.P/B less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued.P/S less than X-Industry Median: The lower the P/S ratio, the more attractive the stock is, as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median. This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50,000: The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of $5 or higher.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank, which has proven its worth since inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have always managed to beat adversities and outperform the market.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.Here are our five picks out of the eight stocks that passed the screen:Unum Group provides long-term care insurance, life insurance, employer- and employee-paid group benefits and related services.

The stock is presently a Zacks Rank #1 (Buy), with shares yielding a solid 3% annual dividend.Shares currently trade at a 6.2X forward 12-month earnings multiple, just marginally above the five-year median and well below the Zacks Finance sector average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, the company’s current forward 12-month price-to-sales ratio works out to be 0.7X, again well beneath the Zacks sector average.UNM carries a Style Score of “A” for Value.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnd to top it off, the company carries a respectable growth profile, with earnings forecasted to climb 15% on 3% higher revenues in its current fiscal year (FY23). And in FY24, earnings and revenue are projected to witness growth of 5.3% and 3.3%, respectively.NXP SemiconductorsNXP Semiconductors, a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), is a global semiconductor company providing high-performance mixed signal and standard product solutions used in various applications. Shares currently yield 2.4% annually, with the company’s payout growing by an impressive 40% over the last five years.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNXPI’s current 12.3X forward 12-month earnings multiple sits well beneath the 16.1X five-year median, with the value also reflecting a 47% discount relative to the Zacks Computer and Technology sector.The stock carries a Style Score of “B” for Value.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGraphic Packaging Graphic Packaging is a leading provider of paperboard packaging solutions for various products. Analysts have raised their earnings estimates across the board, helping land the stock into a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGPK’s 8.5X forward 12-month earnings multiple is a fraction of the 12.9X five-year median and the Zacks Industrial Products sector average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, the forward 12-month price-to-sales ratio presently sits at a small 0.8X, nearly in line with the five-year median and again nowhere near the Zacks sector average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineValue investors are always looking for deals, expecting the rest of the crowd to eventually catch onto the discounts and lead to significant gains.And when you pair this strategy with the Zacks Rank, which is focused on earnings estimate revisions, it’s much easier to find mispriced stocks with great near-term potential.All three stocks above – Unum Group UNM, NXP Semiconductors NXPI, and Graphic Packaging Holding Company GPK – could be watchlist considerations.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

10,7583f756-3265-325e-8e95-6defaddcb0f5,UNM,2023-05-17,Learn How to Find Surging 'Strong Buy' Stocks Trading Close to Their Highs,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/learn-surging-strong-buy-stocks-182506184.html,1684261506,STORY,"['UNM', 'FIX']","[The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq swung between small gains and losses through morning trading Tuesday as retail giants and consumer spending grab the Wall Street spotlight. Many investors are also growing increasingly uneasy about the debt-ceiling negotiations.Retail sales climbed by a seasonally adjusted 0.4% in April up from a -0.7% decline in March. The rebound ended a two-month skid and showcased that the low unemployment rate is helping the consumer-driven economy march forward despite recession fears.It is possible that Home Depot’s fresh, downbeat sales guidance on Tuesday is a sign of what’s to come from the likes of Target and others. It is also very plausible that Home Depot won’t be a harbinger, but simply faces a very difficult-to-compete against stretch of growth and slowing home improvement and renovation spending after a covid boom.Despite the unknowns of what’s to come on the retail spending front and the debt-ceiling headlines, the tech-heavy Nasdaq is grinding higher and the benchmark remains solidly above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. But not all stocks are taking part in the upbeat start to 2023, with strong performances from some huge tech names papering over a decent chunk of bearishness.   This backdrop means investors likely want to search for stocks that are working in 2023 and over the last year. Today we utilize a screen that helps investors find stocks that have boosted their earnings outlooks and are trading near their highs as we enter the back half of May.Don't Be Afraid of New HighsSome investors might prefer not to buy stocks at new highs. But if somebody asked you what the best stocks in your portfolio are, it’s likely you would name the stocks moving up the most.The most basic idea is that the winners in your portfolio are the ones going up. If a stock is underperforming the market or going down, you'll quickly identify it as one of your worst holdings. Therefore, it makes sense that some of these stocks will be reaching new highs along the way.Story continuesMany investors are hesitant to buy stocks making new 52-week highs. But there really isn’t any reason to be. Some may worry that they have already missed the mark at that point, or that now it has more room to fall. Still, a stock making a new 52-week high is a ‘good thing,’ just as one falling to a new 52-week low is a ‘bad thing.’On top of that, would the person who doesn’t want to buy stocks making new highs be upset if a stock they owned broke out to a new 52-week high? Statistics have also shown that stocks making new highs have a tendency of making even higher highs. And aren’t these the stocks we all dream about?Now obviously, the fundamentals need to be there, and you should try to keep an eye on valuations. But if you were in a stock making new highs and cheering it on, it seems odd to be afraid of one doing the same just because you haven't bought it yet.Think about this: A stock just made a new-52 week high, which is great news. Guess what? Last year it made a new 52-week high as well. And the year before that. And the year before that. Can you imagine all the money you'd be leaving on the table if you were afraid of being in stocks every time they made a new high?Parameters• Current Price/52-Week High greater than or equal to .80• Percent Change in Price over 12 Weeks greater than 0• Percent Change in Price over 4 Weeks greater than 0• Zacks Rank equal to 1• Price/Sales Ratio less than or equal to Industry Median• P/E (using F1 Estimates) less than or equal to Industry Median• Projected One Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than or equal to Industry Median• Current Avg. 20-Day Volume greater than Previous Week's Avg. 20-Day Volume• All of the above parameters are applied to stocks with a Price greater than or equal to $5 and an Average 20-Day Volume of greater than or equal to 100,000 shares.• Percent Change in Price over 12 Weeks + Percent Change in Price over 4 Weeks equal to Top # 5Here are two of the five stocks that made it through today’s screen… Unum Group (UNM)Unum is an insurance firm with a portfolio that features disability, life, accident, critical illness, cancer, dental and vision coverage. UNM topped our quarterly earnings and revenue estimates in early May and boosted its view as its strong 2022 momentum carried over in 2023, driven by “increases in sales and premium across” its “core operations and performance of our group disability business.”Zacks estimates call for Unum’s adjusted earnings to climb 15% in this year and another 5% next year on around 3% stronger sales during both periods. UNM’s upbeat earnings revisions estimates help it grab a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and its most recent analyst estimates are coming in above Unum’s already-improved EPS consensus.Unum’s Insurance - Accident and Health industry is in the top 6% of over 250 Zacks industries, which is a real positive amid some increasing market uncertainty. UNM’s dividend yields roughly 3% at the moment and its 20% payout ratio leaves it plenty of room to keep boosting its payout. UNM shares have jumped nearly 200% in the last three years vs. the S&amp;P 500’s 40% and its industry’s 90%. UNM is up 22% in the last 12 months and yet it trades about 14% below its average Zacks price target. Plus, it trades at a 40% discount to its industry at 6.2X forward 12-month earnings.  Comfort Systems USA, Inc. (FIX) Comfort Systems USA is a leading provider of building systems installation and maintenance in the U.S. Comfort Systems, which is made up of roughly 45 operating companies in over 170 locations, aims to provide mechanical and electrical services, as well as process piping, modular construction, controls, energy efficiency and tons of other nonresidential building renovation and service needs.The building and service provider for mechanical, electrical, modular, and plumbing building systems crushed our Q1 earnings estimates in late April by 41%. Comfort Systems said its “cash flow was unusually strong, especially for a first quarter” and its “backlog increased yet again, reflecting good ongoing demand in traditional and modular construction.”FIX boosted its outlook, with its FY23 and FY24 consensus EPS estimates up 13% and 15%, respectively since its report. Comfort Systems is projected to grow its bottom line by 36% this year and 14% next year on 18% and 6% higher revenue.Comfort Systems is part of the Building Products - Air Conditioner and Heating industry that ranks in the top 8% of over 250 Zacks industries. The firm has raised its dividend by 14% annualized over the last five years and its 12% payout ratio leaves FIX plenty of room to continue this trend. Comfort Systems shares have soared 1,000% in the last decade, including a 75% run during the past 12 months. Even with FIX’s stellar market and industry-destroying performance, it trades 16% below its average Zacks price target and at a 25% discount to its highly-ranked industry at 20.8X forward 12-month earnings.Get the rest of the stocks on this list and start looking for the newest companies that fit these criteria.

You can skip our detailed analysis of Fisher's hedge fund and his investment philosophy, and go directly to read Billionaire Ken Fisher's Top 5 Dividend Stock Picks. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is one of the most prominent hedge funds in America. The firm emphasizes the importance of analyzing market trends and using quantitative methods to identify potential investment opportunities. In addition to this, the hedge fund also provides personalized investment advice to individual clients. Over the years, the firm grew and expanded its client base, managing portfolios for high-net-worth individuals, institutions, and pension funds. As of May, Fisher’s real-time net worth stands at $6.7 billion.High interest rates have been a cause of worry for investors this year as interest rates reached their 16-year high. The Fed’s efforts to fight inflation have had significant impacts on the investment strategies of investors in the US. According to Fisher, Fed decisions do not have a long-term impact on the stock market’s performance. He thinks investors should follow their long-term investment strategy by avoiding short-term volatility caused by continuous interest rate hikes.Recently, Fisher Investments announced that it would relocate its corporate headquarters to Texas, following Washington’s supreme court ruling which upheld that the capital gains tax is constitutional on the state’s wealthiest residents, according to a report by Bloomberg. The firm will also increase employee transfers over time.As of the close of the first quarter of 2023, Fisher Asset Management’s portfolio was valued at nearly $165.1 billion, up from $148 billion in the preceding quarter. The hedge fund had major investments in the tech sector, with the finance, healthcare, services, and basic materials sectors also making up significant portions of the portfolio. The firm also held investments in dividend stocks like Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX).

(NYSE:MRK) is a provider of health care solutions including prescription medicines, vaccines, biologic therapies, animal health and consumer care products. Shares have benefited from investors seeking safety in areas with less economic and interest rate sensitivity. With about one third of its sales generated by blockbuster oncology drug Keytruda, the key issue for investors is the success of its large R&amp;D pipeline to replace those sales when Keytruda comes off patent in 2028. However, Merck seems to be getting little credit from investors for the 60+ programs it has in clinical development, despite having several solid and large new product opportunities.

The actual card is fairly sleek (as you can see below), as customers names are etched into an Apple titanium card. The no-fee card generated a lot of hype, as many early users were quick to post their latest card on various social media sites.The initial goal of Marcus (back in 2016) was to leverage Goldman’s wonderful name brand and build a full-service digital bank. This card was a large piece of GS’s ambitions to grow its retail banking franchise called Marcus. After 5 years, Marcus now has 14 million customers and $16 billion in loan balances. Surprisingly, Marcus now represents nearly 20% of the firm’s total revenue.We thought it would be interesting to look how the Apple Card is doing in terms of loans and exposures. With over $100 billion in assets, this has been a successful source of cheap deposits for GS. Despite having an institutional / “white shoe” brand in the investment banking and trading world, GS’s Apple Card has been a disappointment.” (Click here to read the full text)11.

MS is a leading investment bank and wealth management firm with approximately $5 trillion of client assets under management. It merged Citigroup’s Smith Barney business into its own wealth management business after the 2008 recession/financial crisis, which resulted in a more stable business model. Recent acquisitions of asset manager Eaton Vance and E-Trade provide additional stability and higher returns on capital. We believe MS has a sustainable competitive advantage due to its size and scale, global reach, strong reputation, and financial distribution capabilities. Importantly for a financial institution, it is in good financial health as key leverage ratios including common equity Tier 1 ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio, Tier 1 leverage ratio, and supplementary leverage ratio were all well above required minimums at the end of 2021.Our thesis on MS is that its wealth management business will continue to become a larger part of the overall company, which will increase overall margins and return on equity (ROE). Wealth management and asset management are less cyclical than investment banking, and often generate higher margins and provide better stability of financial results. For example, the addition of Smith Barney added significant scale and boosted wealth management operating margins from below 10% into the mid-20%s over the past several years while also increasing returns on equity. Looking ahead, we believe the company will benefit from rising asset prices and higher interest rates, should they happen over time…” (Click here to see the full text)9. Caterpillar Inc.

Over the last 50 years, global personal consumer expenditures (PCE) has grown 7-9% annualized. We expect 4-5% long-term PCE growth going forward. Additionally, the shift from cash to credit continues unabated, with a total credit penetration of only approximately 50% globally.3 This shift provides Visa and Mastercard with another ~4-6% of growth. When combined with PCE, this gives both companies high-single-digit to low-double[1]digit revenue growth opportunities. This growth estimate is before accounting for growth amplifiers like the acceleration of e[1]commerce, the shift from offline to online, and additional services. Both companies enjoy extremely strong network effects that provide strong competitive advantages.We have trimmed Visa and Mastercard because their combined weight grew to over 12% of the Global Growth Portfolio because of their recent performance and to fund our increase in Amazon’s position size. We added to both positions when their prices were depressed due to cross-border transactions deteriorating materially from the pandemic. Cross-border volumes came roaring back when travel corridors reopened, and although we are several quarters removed from the cross-border nadir, Visa still grew volumes &gt;30% in 1Q23. Total cross-border volumes are now 132% of 2019 levels. At 4.5% each, both companies remain high conviction positions for Global Growth.”7.

(or any successor administrator) plus the relevant tenor spread adjustment (""3-month Term SOFR"") will be the replacement reference rate for certain outstanding floating rate or fixed-to-floating rate debt securities, preferred stock represented by depositary shares, income trust securities, and preferred stock issued by U.S. Bank National Association, U.S. Bancorp, USB Capital IX and USB Realty Corp. (collectively, ""U.S. Bancorp"") that use 3-month U.S. dollar LIBOR (""USD LIBOR"") as the reference rate and are governed by U.S. law (such instruments collectively, the ""Legacy LIBOR Instruments"").In March 2021, the UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that after June 30, 2023, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month USD LIBOR settings either will cease publication or no longer be representative.In connection with the cessation of representative USD LIBOR, in the United States, the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the ""LIBOR Act"") was passed and subsequently implemented by regulations issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the ""LIBOR Rule"") to aid transition efforts with respect to certain U.S. law-governed legacy contracts through a statutory replacement of USD LIBOR with a SOFR-based replacement rate. The LIBOR Rule also establishes relevant tenor spread adjustments applicable to the SOFR-based replacement rates and sets forth technical, administrative, or operational change, alterations, or modifications that are necessary or appropriate to the implementation, administration, and calculation of the replacement reference rate (the ""LIBOR Act Conforming Changes"").Certain Legacy LIBOR Instruments lack a clearly defined or practicable benchmark replacement rate, while others contain hardwired contractual fallback provisions that specify the transition to a specific successor reference rate and spread adjustment and, in either case, also may contemplate conforming changes that are necessary or appropriate to the implementation, administration, and calculation of the replacement reference rate. Each Legacy LIBOR Instrument referenced herein will transition to 3-month Term SOFR plus the relevant tenor spread adjustment on the first applicable date after June 30, 2023 either (i) pursuant to the LIBOR Act and LIBOR Rule by operation of law, (ii) pursuant to the discretion of a determining person to select the benchmark replacement under the LIBOR Act or LIBOR Rule, or (iii) pursuant to the contractual terms of the Legacy LIBOR Instrument for any Legacy LIBOR Instruments that have hardwired fallback provisions.Story continuesFor the following types of Legacy LIBOR Instruments that lack a clearly defined or practicable benchmark replacement rate and currently use 3-month USD LIBOR as the reference rate or will use 3-month USD LIBOR as the reference rate during a floating rate period, in accordance with the LIBOR Act and LIBOR Rule, by operation of law, 3-month Term SOFR will be the reference rate for calculations of the amount of interest or dividends payable with respect to interest or dividend periods with determination dates occurring after June 30, 2023:Floating rate debt securities issued by U.S. Bank National AssociationFloating rate and fixed-to-floating rate preferred stock (represented by depositary shares) issued by U.S. BancorpFixed-to-floating rate income trust securities issued by USB Capital IXFixed-to-floating rate preferred stock issued by USB Realty Corp.Annex A provides a list of USD LIBOR-linked instruments that will transition to 3-month Term SOFR by operation of law following June 30, 2023, pursuant to the LIBOR Act and LIBOR Rule.For Legacy LIBOR Instruments that lack a clearly defined or practicable benchmark replacement rate and provide a determining person with authority to select the benchmark replacement rate, 3-month Term SOFR will be the applicable reference rate for calculations of the amount of interest or dividends payable with respect to interest or dividend periods with determination dates occurring after June 30, 2023. Annex B provides details on such USD LIBOR-linked instruments that will transition to 3-month Term SOFR following June 30, 2023.For Legacy LIBOR Instruments for which hardwired contractual fallback provisions specify the transition to a successor reference rate and spread adjustment following the cessation of the publication of 3-month USD LIBOR on a representative basis, 3-month Term SOFR will be the applicable reference rate for calculations of the amount of interest or dividends payable with respect to interest or dividend periods with determination dates occurring after June 30, 2023. Annex C provides details on such USD LIBOR-linked instruments that will transition, pursuant to the terms of such instruments, to 3-month Term SOFR following June 30, 2023.In each case, and as explained above, the 3-month Term SOFR replacement rate, and therefore the calculation of the amount of interest or dividends payable on securities or instruments for interest or dividend periods with determination dates that occur after June 30, 2023, also will include the tenor spread adjustment of 0.26161%, provided in the LIBOR Act and LIBOR Rule for securities or instruments that reference 3-month LIBOR or consistent with the terms of the hardwired fallback provisions, as appropriate. In addition, the LIBOR Act Conforming Changes will apply to and will become an integral part of the Legacy LIBOR Instruments transitioning under the LIBOR Act and LIBOR Rule, as well as those instruments transitioning pursuant to hardwired contractual fallback provisions.For the avoidance of doubt, each Legacy LIBOR Instrument will transition to a replacement rate as described herein, and this announcement does not automatically transition such securities and instruments to the replacement rate as of the date hereof. Also, circumstances could change that could impact the timing and other information described herein.This press release applies only to the USD LIBOR securities listed in the Annexes to this press release and does not relate to any other securities or other instruments.

She settled in Louisville and quickly found work at a local bank.""When I moved to Louisville, there was not much of a Hispanic community and I didn't really have anyone to turn to"" she said, reflecting on finding community through her love of percussion and joining a salsa band. ""Now, people come to me.""A few years after arriving in the U.S. and working her way up from a teller position, she joined U.S. Bank in the home mortgage division. She now leans on her own experience of navigating a new country, new language and new systems to help the local Hispanic community learn about homeownership, how to qualify and the importance of creating a banking relationship.The sweet spot for many of her clients is the American Dream home mortgage - a special program designed to provide greater access to homeownership by providing assistance in the areas of down payment assistance and credit requirements.""There are so many good things about the American Dream product, but it really is the down payment assistance that helps so many buyers overcome that obstacle,"" said Garcia. ""When you come from a different country, you are starting a new life and many times starting over financially.""To date, she has helped more than 650 individuals and families achieve the dream of sustainable homeownership, earning recognition as a top 25 Latino Mortgage Originator in the United States by National Association of Hispanic Real Estate ProfessionalsStory continuesHer manager, Brian Dillon, mortgage retail area manager for U.S. Bank, says that part of Garcia's success has been in learning early on about the power of building a network in her community.""She is a fierce advocate for her clients and has realized that her clients aren't just her customers, it's so many other people in the community,"" Dillon said. ""She's always willing to help, is always positive, always has a smile on her face and is always willing to make introductions in the community.""""When you come from a different country, you are starting a new life and many times starting over financially."" - Joanna GarciaAlong the way, she has also helped her clients navigate the American way - including online banking. In her homeland of Cuba, Joanna says technology isn't as prevalent as it is in the U.S., with only about half the population banking electronically.""That's why I really hold their hand and help my clients pull all the pieces together. We are with them every step of the way,"" she said about serving not only clients from Cuba, but many Spanish speaking customers from other backgrounds. ""There's nothing better than speaking your own language and being comfortable in your culture.""Over the last year as interest rates have increased and housing prices have remained high, Garcia has focused on educating potential homebuyers about steps to take in their financial lives to become qualified for an American Dream mortgage.""There is more of a need to educate buyers right now on how to qualify in the near future for a mortgage, such as the importance of working stable hours and building good credit.""For more information on the American Dream mortgage, visit the home loans section of the U.S. Bank website.

The data were presented in a late-breaking clinical data session at EuroPCR 2023.Edwards Lifesciences logo. (PRNewsFoto/Edwards Lifesciences Corporation)The study observed 2,405 patients who underwent TAVR with a balloon-expandable valve at 28 sites in seven European countries to determine if implementing a set of tailored Benchmark practices could improve hospital length of stay (LOS), intensive care unit (ICU) bed occupancy, and patient and staff satisfaction while preserving patient safety. Patients undergoing TAVR experienced a 25% reduction in ICU stay, a 33% reduction in the median hospital LoS while maintaining 30-day clinical outcomes similar to patients treated before the implementation of the Benchmark pathway. Researchers concluded that a wider implementation of Benchmark best practices will make the TAVR pathway more efficient without compromising patient safety.Beyond a marked decrease in ICU stay and hospital LoS with no loss of patient safety at 30 days, the study results also reflected high patient satisfaction with all elements of the Benchmark practices, scoring above 90% in post-procedure patient satisfaction surveys.""The results of this study validate the Edwards Benchmark program as an important tool in reducing the variation in clinical pathways for patients undergoing TAVI [TAVR] across Europe,"" said Derk Frank, head of cardiology at University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, in Kiel, Germany.  ""Our results indicate significant improvements in efficiency without compromising patient safety.""The Edwards Benchmark program standardizes a minimalist approach to TAVR with a focus on conscious sedation, recovery outside the ICU, and a goal of next-day discharge that unlocks the inherent benefits of TAVR's less invasive nature while preserving patient outcomes. An economic analysis by the PARTNER 3 trial investigators identified TAVR as an ""economically dominant"" strategy to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) among low risk patients and recognized the potential for greater efficiencies with the continued evolution of minimalist TAVR procedures.1 Further research found that a minimalist TAVR pathway (compared to standard TAVR from the SAPIEN 3 Intermediate Risk Registry) was associated with potential cost savings of $11,000 USD per case during the index hospitalization.2Story continues""The Benchmark Registry contributes to the growing body of evidence that demonstrates TAVR as a triple win that not only saves lives, but also improves patients' quality of life and saves money for the healthcare system,"" said Larry Wood, Edwards' corporate vice president and group president, transcatheter aortic valve replacement and surgical structural heart. ""These data should give implanters confidence that the Benchmark program can help TAVR centers be more efficient without compromising safety.""Benchmark best practices cover communication, patient and staff education, decision making and clinical procedures. It is currently being utilized in more than 320 centers in the United States, Europe, Australia, Canada, Korea and New Zealand.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Right now, Integer is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Edwards Lifesciences has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that ITGR likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than EW has recently. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.ITGR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 19.11, while EW has a forward P/E of 34.93. We also note that ITGR has a PEG ratio of 1.61. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. EW currently has a PEG ratio of 5.05.Another notable valuation metric for ITGR is its P/B ratio of 1.86. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, EW has a P/B of 8.92.These metrics, and several others, help ITGR earn a Value grade of B, while EW has been given a Value grade of D.Story continuesITGR is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model.

Those tactics include smash and grab, use of firearms or other weapons, battery, flash mob tactics, or threats of violence against store employees.Story continues“Organized retail crime has been a major concern for the retail industry for decades, endangering store employees and customers, disrupting store operations and inflicting billions in financial loss for retailers and the communities they serve,” said NRF CEO Matthew Shay. “These concerns have grown in recent years, as criminal groups have become more brazen and violent in their tactics and are using new channels to resell stolen goods.""The contentious situation has caused big retailers to vacate certain high-crime cities such as San Francisco in 2023.Nordstrom (JWN) recently followed Whole Foods in exiting a key location in San Francisco, citing concerns over worker safety.Independent news site The San Francisco Standard has tracked 20 closures of household-name stores in the city since 2010, including Office Depot.A view of the infant formula aisle at a Target store in Times Square, New York City, New York.

The company — similar to other big-box chains — has also resorted to locking up items like mouthwash to reduce theft.""So it is widespread, and I can tell you, as I talk to my retail peers, is that it's a common theme across all of retail.

(NYSE:HD) shares declined as the retailer slashed its outlook and expectations for annual sales. The stock pared earlier losses but remained in negative territory. The home improvement retailer forecasts sales to decline by a staggering 2% to 5% in fiscal 2023 as demand eases for renovation projects and accompanying goods.Ahead of a week chock full of earnings reports from retailers, Home Depot posted a revenue miss which points to weak demand and comparable sales that also missed estimates. Among the factors cited were inclement weather in California in the latest quarter, alongside lumber deflation, and “broad-based pressure across the business” compared to Q4 2022 – according to Home Depot CEO and President, Ted Decker.Retailer companies reporting quarterly earnings this week, include Target Corp. (NYSE:TGT), TJX Cos. (NYSE:TJX), Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT), and Foot Locker Inc. (NYSE: FL).

Here with more on the latest market action in retail we have Yahoo Finance contributor Remy Blaire. Remy there on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. What's going on?REMY BLAIRE: Well, US equity markets remain mostly lower this morning. We are seeing the Dow Jones Industrial Average as well as the S&amp;P lower and the NASDAQ trading on both sides of flat this morning.And, of course, Home Depot's shares are in the spotlight today following its latest earnings report, and shares do remain in negative territory. Earlier, the retail slashed its outlook and also said that it expects annual sales for the home-improvement retailer to fall as consumers cut spending and as demand for home renovations and home-improvement goods pull back.Meanwhile, taking a closer look at the details out from the earnings report, Home Depot does expect sales to decline by 2% to 5% in fiscal 2023, and that is a considerable pullback considering that earlier this year the retailer said that it expect to see flat sales.Story continuesMeanwhile, first-quarter revenue missed analysts' forecasts as well with revenue down by 4.2% at $37.26 billion. This is the biggest revenue miss since November 2002.At the same time, comp sales fell by 4 and 1/2% for the retailer, much more than expected. At the same time, Q1 profit did come in above estimates at $3.87 billion.And this week we will be getting more earnings out from the retail sector. We have Target as well as TJX Companies, Walmart, as well as Foot Locker at the end of this week. Keep in mind that we've got US retail sales for the latest month, which did show an increase of 0.4%, but that was half than the gain expected.And ahead of the reports, some analysts expect to see headwinds that are weighing on discretionary spending as US consumers continue to adjust shopping habits as well as tighten household budgets.RACHELLE AKUFFO: All right, thank you for that.

But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. Specifically, we decided to study Under Armour's  ROE in this article.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for Under Armour How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Under Armour is:19% = US$387m ÷ US$2.0b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.19 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.A Side By Side comparison of Under Armour's Earnings Growth And 19% ROETo begin with, Under Armour seems to have a respectable ROE. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 19%. Consequently, this likely laid the ground for the decent growth of 6.5% seen over the past five years by Under Armour.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Under Armour's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 14% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about Under Armour's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is Under Armour Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Given that Under Armour doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that Under Armour's performance has been quite good. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. As a result, the decent growth in its earnings is not surprising. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

(Photo: Shutterstock/FreightWaves)ORLANDO, Fla. — If there were a contest to find the buzzword that sums up the Gartner Supply Chain Symposium, the winner would be clear: AI.Companies boasted about their artificial intelligence bona fides on the floor of the recently concluded show. The flood of emails sent to journalists covering the event, offering up interviews with executives, almost all touted the AI credentials of the companies being pitched. And with international media focused on the capabilities of AI-driven ChatGPT in recent months, supply chain software providers that didn’t boast in Orlando about how they use AI to differentiate themselves would have seemed woefully behind the times.“I would say there are about 1,000 percent more mentions of AI this year than last year,” Keith Hartley, the relatively new CEO at LevaData, said of the conference.Of course, AI within supply chain software is not new. But what is new are the capabilities of ChatGPT and how that generative AI can impact the huge network of supply chain software providers. In a recent paper on the subject, the consulting firm KPMG described generative AI as “an emerging form of AI that can create original articles, essays, images, music, and yes, code, by building on patterns it finds in existing text, audio files, images and software.”What many people at a meeting like Gartner acknowledge in private is that the rows and rows of exhibitors selling software solutions for the supply chain all have products that for some overwhelming majority of their capabilities — is it 90%? It is more? — all do the same thing. There is a basic foundation of functions that needs to be performed in any sort of supply chain technology.But it is those last percentage points that distinguish one solution from another and can be the  difference between success and failure. And with generative AI on top of earlier AI capabilities, it’s clear that this is one of the areas where the battle will be fought.Story continuesIBM demonstrates its Watson solutionOne of the more heavily attended events was a presentation by Rob Cushman, senior partner, worldwide leader – supply chain transformation at IBM, who demonstrated the company’s still-fledgling — and mostly internal — generative AI capabilities that are targeted to its supply chain business.Cushman demonstrated a test case in which IBM’s generative AI capabilities were asked to track parts shortages in a supply chain. IBM has had AI capabilities through its Watson natural language processing service for more than 10 years.His demonstration asked Watson to track the availability of one particular part, and through a series of clicks and written questions, AI would bring up further details on the availability of that part. “What is the stock?” Cushman said, reviewing some of the questions that might be asked. “What’s on order? Do I see gaps in my supply perspective?” The generative AI capabilities in the supply chain provide “an integrated view of what I as a person who owns this part needs to be focused on today as I come online and sit down at my desk.”That was a point that came up in several discussions about AI: It’s not necessarily a job killer. As Cushman said, the data on that part’s availability that is processed by Watson lets the user “make an informed decision” on managing the supply chain.Hartley and LevaData used the occasion of the meeting to roll out the company’s new capabilities that also rely on generative AI. LevaData’s offering support materials sourcing; as he noted during an interview with FreightWaves, a mouse on the table in front of him was manufactured with about 200 individual components, and LevaData’s capabilities assist the company’s clients in the supply chain to secure them.But as he noted, using AI is not new for LevaData. “We’ve been using AI and statistical modeling for a long time, so it’s great that it’s called AI,” he said. “Now it’s generative AI, which we’re adding and moving that way.”An example of LevaData’s generative AI capabilities appears on the company’s web page with this kind of dialogue, similar to what Cushman showed in his IBM presentation.Overhaul is another supply chain software that rolled out a generative AI solution at the Gartner conference, this one in partnership with Microsoft. Overhaul’s value proposition is as a provider of visibility, with particular emphasis on finding immediate risks in a company’s supply chain operations.Microsoft and Overhaul team upDavid Warrick, executive vice president of the Enterprise division at Overhaul, said collaboration with Microsoft enables the company to use the software giant’s ChatGPT capabilities to be bolted onto Overhaul’s RiskGPT product, which identifies risks in a supply chain. Warrick said the product is only being used internally so far.“We have a number of watch officers who are monitoring our platform at all times looking for alert events, like deviations and unscheduled stops,” Warrick said.Introducing the abilities of generative AI into the process, Warrick said, means that “all of our agents are now working off exactly the same set of rules that are being interpreted the same way.” Where in the past an incident might be addressed differently by the company’s “watch officers,” Warrick said the generative AI capabilities now available in RiskGPT would result in a more systematic approach to dealing with risk issues that the Overhaul service discovers.Precisely how the new system will play out will take some time to determine; Warrick said it was introduced in Overhaul’s internal systems only last week.But he added that the capabilities, when opened up to the network of Overhaul users, will not be an add-on service with a separate subscription fee. It will be a standard part of the company’s product offering.Karin Stevens, chief marketing and product officer at Overhaul, said she sees a role for generative AI in training on compliance issues. Generative AI would “eliminate the subjectivity” in many instances, she said, “and we can take out the decision-making about ‘What do I next?’”Dawn Andre, chief product officer of JAGGAER, whose platform manages direct and indirect spending, said in an interview that AI and machine learning usage can have numerous applications that aren’t necessarily as visible as something that is driven by generative AI.“One of the challenges we have today is that the talent is remote, and we are all trying to find a way to bring that expertise into their day-to-day activities, when you don’t have that person sitting in the cube next to you,” Andre said in an interview at the JAGGAER booth on the symposium floor, talking about a use of AI. That sort of expertise can be built into AI-driven applications a company uses in its internal activities, “and it keeps that user and that professional refining their skill set and building their productivity each time they run a process,” Andre said.Those people remain key even as AI and machine learning grow, Andre said, noting that those processes can “automate a lot of mundane tasks” while staff members can “focus more on being strategic.”Although incorporating environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles may be morphing into a political football in certain places, it came up several times over the course of the Gartner conference. None of the references suggested that large portions of the logistics industry has any plans on moving away from integrating ESG into decision-making, whether for internal operations or in selecting companies it does business with.Andre said she sees AI as being able to provide companies with far more detailed ESG information on possible customers and suppliers.AI gives a company an improved ability to determine if a counterparty meets a company’s criteria, Andre said, because it can utilize data both from open sources and internal survey information.“Once we have the data, then [AI] can be used to curate information based on criteria that is unique to me, and whatever initiatives are going on in the priorities for your company,” she said. Through that AI-generated information, Andre said, “the system can source the best candidates to participate in a bid process, not just for a product or lane but somebody who shares the same values.”Still fighting the spreadsheetIf conventional or generative AI seems like such a huge boost to efficiency, shouldn’t rapid adoption be a breeze?Don’t count on it, came the repeated answer at the symposium.At Locus, which describes itself as a dispatch management platform servicing the final mile, Chief Revenue Officer Mehul Kapadia said AI is used to meet a broad goal that “any delivery should be done in a better way than the last one in terms of sustainability and cost, so we use AI and machine learning essentially for that.”AI at Locus uses what Kapadia called “constraints,” which inform a last-mile driver that a delivery can’t be made at a certain time of day for a particular location, or that a certain type of package requires more than one person to make the delivery. “We use our technology to essentially do a lot of the continuous learning and figure out what combination will work,” he said. “It is a decision-making tool rather than just a transport management tool.”But that’s internal.Kapadia echoed a theme that came up repeatedly in discussions: With all the technology thrown at the supply chain today, with all the venture capital money, with all the bright people and their aisles of solutions on the exhibition hall floor, with the prospect of generative AI about to ramp up the technological capabilities further, purveyors of supply chain solutions are still fighting the lowly spreadsheet.“On-the-ground operations will still take some time before we fully get in,” Kapadia conceded. “I don’t want to put a time frame on it. People and change management will be a big challenge.”More articles by John KingstonEY Americas leader: 70% of supply chain digital transformation efforts failQuiet quit a product of disengaged supply chain workforceFifteen states jump into California’s ongoing AB5 legal battleThe post AI isn’t new to the supply chain, but ChatGPT is expanding its role appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

""The tech revolution isn’t about giving sellers more technology, it’s about giving technology more responsibility.""New technologies, such as generative AI and digital humans, have the potential to transform the role of the seller. Sales leaders will need to rethink how to meet buyers’ inflated digital expectations. Those who don’t risk distancing themselves from buyers and leaving real money on the table.""Sales is at a turning pointWhile sellers are often the CSO’s most obvious option to help buyers through dysfunction to reach their goals, they’re also the most expensive. The tight labor market, administrative burden of overinvesting in the wrong technologies, and the persistent skills gap renders this approach ineffective.Organizations can finally move beyond simple automation and assisted selling to true augmented selling, where technology plays an active role in the design and execution of the sales process. As technology becomes fully embedded over time, sellers can lean on technology as their teammate to delegate tasks associated with lead generation or basic customer interactions.Story continuesGenerative AI, in particular, has the power to automatically generate and personalize sales content based on the customer and their current needs, with sellers only needing to view the output.Accentuate human superpowers to win deals and do what tech can’tWhile a high percentage of buyers report preferring a rep-free experience, this preference is at odds with what makes for a high-quality deal. Buyers who receive validation that a purchase feels right for them are 30% more likely to complete an ambitious or premium purchase that lived up to expectations. Gartner calls this Value Affirmation, and buyers that engage with a human during the purchase process are 2.3x more likely to experience it.""Value affirmation's importance in enabling high-quality deals highlights how feelings matter just as much as facts for today's B2B buyers,"" said Alice Walmesley, Director, Advisory in the Gartner Sales Practice.The best sellers intuitively have the ability to infer buyers’ unspoken beliefs, feelings and intentions to predict and influence buyer behavior. Technology comes in to free up sellers’ time, so they can better catch these innately human feelings.""CSOs can coach core performers accordingly and ensure technology unlocks their sellers’ potential to be more human than ever. Progressive sales organizations are shifting their mindsets from a technology versus human approach, to a technology and human approach, where each entity brings out the best in one another to complete high-quality deals,"" concluded Walmesley.About the Gartner CSO &amp; Sales Leaders ConferenceThe Gartner CSO &amp; Sales Leader Conference is taking place May 16-17, 2023 in Las Vegas, providing sales leaders with the latest research on sales talent, customer buying behavior, account-based marketing strategies and leveraging digital channels.

Gasoline and distillate inventories marked a sharp drop.The data usually heralds a similar trend from an official reading due later on Wednesday, and showed that oil supply in the world’s largest consumer remained bloated, although releases from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) also factored into the inventory build.The drop in gasoline and distillates pointed to improving demand ahead of the summer season, which usually sees increased air and road travel.But other readings from the U.S. still pointed to worsening economic prospects this year, as retail sales missed expectations for April and industrial production remained depressed. This, coupled with increased market uncertainty over raising the U.S. debt ceiling, weighed on crude prices.Brent oil futures fell 0.1% to $74.52 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell 0.6% to $70.47 a barrel by 20:57 ET (00:57 GMT). Both contracts fell about 0.7% on Tuesday.Weaker-than-expected retail sales and industrial production data from China cut short a recovery in crude prices on Tuesday, as investors fretted over a demand recovery in the world’s largest oil importer.A string of weak economic readings this month showed that a post-COVID rebound in China was likely running out of steam, sparking questions over whether the country will drive oil demand to record highs this year.This saw traders largely look past forecasts from the International Energy Agency that crude demand will hit record highs this year, which was also posited by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.Story continuesPlans by the U.S. government to begin refilling the SPR also provided a limited boost to oil prices this week, given that the initial 3 million barrel buy flagged by the government accounts for a fraction of daily global consumption.A rebound in the dollar also stymied crude prices after a string of Federal Reserve officials offered a hawkish outlook on monetary policy, given that inflation is still running well above the Fed’s 2% annual target.Related ArticlesOil edges lower as U.S. inventories rise, economic concerns persistGold pressured by debt ceiling uncertainty, copper slumps amid China woesUS House Republicans blast EPA refusal to appear at EV hearing]"

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this investment bank have returned -7.1%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, which Morgan Stanley falls in, has lost 3.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Morgan Stanley is expected to post earnings of $1.60 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -8.5%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.53 points to a change of +2.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -4.9%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.47 indicates a change of +14.4% from what Morgan Stanley is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.4%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Morgan Stanley is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MS _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Morgan Stanley, the consensus sales estimate of $13.62 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +3.8%. The $55.03 billion and $57.9 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.5% and +5.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMorgan Stanley reported revenues of $14.52 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.9%. EPS of $1.70 for the same period compares with $2.06 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.91 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.35%. The EPS surprise was +1.8%.Over the last four quarters, Morgan Stanley surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Morgan Stanley is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Morgan Stanley. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

While seasonal slowness and rising multifamily inventory moderated rent growth, the number of US primary metros still experiencing higher rent burdens plummeted from 49 metros down to only five, a 91% drop from Q4 2022 to Q1 2023. RTI – the percentage of gross income a median-income tenant pays for the average monthly rent – finally cooled after more than three years of steepening rates nationwide.""The fever is finally breaking. Since Q4 2019, 82% of metros had higher rent-burdens compared to pre-COVID because rent disproportionately rose faster than incomes,"" wrote Lu Chen, Senior Economist, and Mary Le, Economist, Moody’s Analytics. ""Rising mortgage rates caused many households to be priced out from homebuying and would-be buyers to remain renters. Apartment demand surged as a result and drove rates sky high. The vast majority (91%) of all metros finally caught a break from growing rent burdens in Q1, as rent growth moderated or even declined given affordability pressures and slowing migration. However, we are not quite at an inflection point yet.""Even with this near-term relief, the cost of shelter remains significantly elevated relative to wages when compared to past decades. In 1999, just one metro was rent-burdened: New York City, with the median NYC household allocating 53.5% of their income to the average-priced apartment. Today, seven US metros fall within this designation: NYC (now 66.9% RTI), Miami (42%), Fort Lauderdale (36.8%), Los Angeles (34.7%), Palm Beach (34.2%), Northern New Jersey (33%), and Boston (32.8%).COVID-19 only exacerbated this issue. NYC’s RTI increased 8.4% between Q4 2019 and Q1 2023. Many metros followed suit, forcing several to become ""rent-burdened"", meaning the typical household pays 30% or more of their income to rent. In Q4 2022, the US became ""rent-burdened"" nationwide for the first time in nearly 25 years of Moody’s Analytics tracking history.Story continues""As wage growth trails behind the cost of shelter, Americans are feeling financially distressed,"" continued Chen and Le. ""With rent growth projected to hover around 2% annually, national RTI will stay mostly flat for the year (29.7%). That is still uncomfortably elevated and only trailing behind last year’s broken record.""About Moody’s AnalyticsMoody’s Analytics provides financial intelligence and analytical tools to help business leaders make better, faster decisions.

In addition, V2X technology could eventually enable customers to use their vehicles as backup home generation when needed.Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PRNewsfoto/Pacific Gas and Electric Company)The V2X testing is taking place at PG&amp;E's Applied Technology Services (ATS) Lab in San Ramon and is the focal point of an extended partnership to advance V2X technology and explore the utilization of EVs as a flexible grid resource. The collaborative testing builds on the momentum of the ChargeForward smart charging program, which was announced in 2015 and offers PG&amp;E customers who drive a BMW EV, incentives to align vehicle charging with renewable energy to help support the overall sustainability of the electric grid.""Electric grid sustainability is becoming an increasingly complex challenge across the U.S.,"" said Adam McNeill, Vice President, Engineering, BMW of North America. ""That's why we started our ChargeForward program in 2015, to connect our vehicles, our customers, and the grid. V2X takes smart charging to the next level, exploring how EV batteries can be used for backup generation and other grid services. We're excited to continue pursuing additional customer benefits while helping make the grid more dependable and sustainable.""V2X technology will someday empower EV drivers to return excess stored energy from their vehicle batteries back to the grid in exchange for compensation, presenting an ideal response to high-demand power conditions and a key solution for grid stability and resiliency. Additionally, V2X technology could play an important role in increasing the amount of greenhouse gas (GHG)-free resources powering the grid by storing solar and wind energy generated during the day to supplement the availability of clean energy during the peak evening demand period and overnight.Story continues""The utility and automotive industries are creating a transformative clean energy future together. At PG&amp;E we are working with partners like BMW to unleash the full potential of EVs to enhance grid resilience and reliability for our customers, while reducing carbon emissions in our hometowns"" said Aaron August, PG&amp;E Vice President, Utility Partnerships and Innovation. ""Clean-powered EVs are vital to the battle against climate change. Using V2X technology to create virtual power plants from EVs can help utilities like ours meet peak electricity demand without the need for non-renewable energy resources. With smart, managed bi-directional charging, we can decarbonize our planet at a lower cost to our customers.""The pilot is assessing how a typical home could maximize its renewable energy usage by switching between EV battery stored renewable energy and grid-provided renewable energy. The EV battery charges when the renewable energy mix on the grid is highest and the battery discharges throughout the day to support the household load. Results show that a vehicle-to-home connected EV is capable of providing roughly double the amount of renewable energy that a typical California household would be able to use on an average day, significantly increasing customers' ability to use more green energy on a daily basis. Testing also offers insights on how V2X vehicles perform under real-world scenarios, taking into consideration vehicle functionality and driver behavior to ensure that EVs can be used as a viable grid resource while still meeting customer needs.PG&amp;E and BMW will continue collaborating to better understand how these learnings can be applied to consider other customer and utility benefits.ChargeForward ProgramThis expanded partnership, focused on V2X testing, is a direct result of the success of ChargeForward. Conceived eight years ago, and now in its third pilot phase, BMW and PG&amp;E were the first to offer customers cash incentives for maximizing renewable energy by optimizing their EV charging times to support the overall reliability of the electric grid. It is available to all BMW battery and plug-in EV drivers in Northern and Central California who are also PG&amp;E residential electric customers.This last year showed that by aligning charging with renewable energy, BMW drivers helped the grid generate and support more clean energy. In California 1.4 million miles were powered by 100% renewable energy in 2022.What's next?BMW and PG&amp;E have agreed to extend their partnership until March 2026 with a focus on smart charging testing. In the next stage of this collaboration, BMW and PG&amp;E will work together to continue testing V2X-enabled vehicles, specifically vehicle-to-grid (V2G), in a field trial at BMW Group Technology Office USA located in Mountain View, Calif. BMW will develop a test fleet of V2X vehicles that will be used in day-to-day operations and serve as a grid resource to help integrate renewable energy and balance the grid. This field test will evaluate how V2X technology can be used for advanced use cases that can be commercialized in future years and help support renewable integration on a neighborhood level to increase grid reliability on a larger scale. PG&amp;E plans to share more in the coming weeks on its V2X testing collaborations and the work the company is doing to maximize the benefits of EVs. Media interested in learning more or visiting the EV Test Bay at PG&amp;E's ATS Laboratory are encouraged to contact PG&amp;E's communications department.About PG&amp;EPacific Gas and Electric Company, a subsidiary of PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), is a combined natural gas and electric utility serving more than 16 million people across 70,000 square miles in Northern and Central California.

The 2.5-foot wide, 2.5-foot deep sauce dispenser features a large touchscreen that offers customers a choice of four bases: Heinz Ketchup, Ranch, 57 Sauce, and BBQ Sauce. Plus, what it's calling enhancers, which currently include Jalapeño, Smoky Chipotle, Buffalo, and Mango. Customers can customize the intensity level of the enhancers (low, medium and high).You'll have to wait though, the Remix is set to debut in-person at the 2023 National Restaurant Association Show in Chicago next week and then in certain restaurants in late 2023 to early 2024.

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland Crunching The NumbersWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.73bUS$2.95bUS$2.80bUS$2.25bUS$2.21bUS$2.19bUS$2.19bUS$2.21bUS$2.23bUS$2.26bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ -0.75%Est @ 0.10%Est @ 0.71%Est @ 1.13%Est @ 1.42% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% US$2.6kUS$2.6kUS$2.3kUS$1.7kUS$1.6kUS$1.5kUS$1.4kUS$1.3kUS$1.2kUS$1.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$17bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.3b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.1%) = US$49bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$49b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$25bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$42b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$73.2, the company appears about fair value at a 5.8% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Archer-Daniels-Midland as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Archer-Daniels-MidlandStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Food market.OpportunityGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

67,3c49d0a4-ddf9-3cff-981e-93e14b3ad1fb,SNPS,2023-05-17,What's in the Offing for Synopsys (SNPS) This Earnings Season?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whats-offing-synopsys-snps-earnings-122512126.html,1684239912,STORY,"['SNPS', 'A', 'HPQ']","[Synopsys SNPS is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2023 results on May 17.The company anticipates revenues between $1.36 billion and $1.39 billion for the fiscal second quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $1.38 billion, suggesting growth of 7.7% from the year-ago period.Synopsys expects non-GAAP earnings between $1.62 and $1.72 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.47 per share indicates a decline of 1.2% year over year.The software company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 4.3%.Let’s see how things have shaped up before the upcoming announcement.Synopsys, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseSynopsys, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Synopsys, Inc. QuoteFactors to ConsiderSynopsys’ second-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from the growing demand for its solid product portfolio. The continuous shift to high-performance cloud computing due to the growing hybrid working environment is expected to have aided the demand for the company’s Intellectual Property (“IP”) solutions, such as Peripheral Component Interconnect Express 5.0 &amp; 6.0, 800G Ethernet and DDR5 memory.The growing impact of artificial intelligence (AI), fifth generation, the Internet of Things, high-performance computing, the Cloud and automotive is anticipated to have boosted the demand for Synopsys’ advanced solutions in the second quarter. The company is likely to have gained from growth in Fusion Compiler, which is fueled by large deal wins in the 5G, AI and server chip markets.In the fiscal second quarter, the increasing global design activity and customer engagements are likely to have been Synopsys’ growth drivers. The strong adoption of interface and foundation IP solutions is likely to have boosted revenues for SNPS’ interface portfolio. Additionally, widespread contract wins and the increasing deployment of the Fusion Platform, including Fusion Compiler, might drive the company’s fiscal second-quarter results.Story continuesSynopsys’ partnership with industry leaders like Microsoft and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company is expected to have accelerated the deployment of its cloud solutions. This might have aided the company’s top line during the quarter under review.SNPS’ solid electronic design automation software partner base, which includes Advanced Micro Devices, Juniper Networks, Realtek, Toshiba and Wolfson, is likely to have served as a major revenue driver. Increased design investments in Synopsys’ ARC processors by automotive companies are also an upside. Further, the strong adoption of security solutions for interfaces, such as PCI Express, CXL and DDR, with more than 30 design wins across all market segments, is positive.However, the heightened competition from the likes of Cadence Design Systems might have played a spoilsport for Synopsys. The tightening corporate budget amid ongoing macroeconomic challenges and unfavorable currency exchange rates are likely to have partially offset the benefits of the aforementioned factors.What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for SNPS this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. However, that’s not the case here.Though Synopsys currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3, it has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Stocks With the Favorable CombinationPer our model, Agilent A, Cisco Systems CSCO and HP Inc.

The company is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2023 results on May 23. Its earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the preceding four quarters, with the average surprise being 7%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Agilent’s second-quarter earnings stands at $1.27 per share, implying a year-over-year increase of 12.4%. It is estimated to report revenues of $1.67 billion, which suggests an increase of approximately 3.8% from the year-ago quarter.Cisco carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +1.59%. The company is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2023 results on May 17. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 1.8%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CSCO’s third-quarter earnings is pegged at 97 cents per share, indicating a year-over-year increase of 11.5%.

HP’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 1.1%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HPQ’s second-quarter earnings is pegged at 76 cents per share, suggesting a decline of 29.6% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of $1.11.

69,628626ad-2b8d-3f59-b261-2bc88a7461cf,PM,2023-05-17,Philip Morris International Inc. (PM) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/philip-morris-international-inc-pm-130001276.html,1684242001,STORY,['PM'],"[Philip Morris (PM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this seller of Marlboro and other cigarette brands have returned -4.9%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Tobacco industry, which Philip Morris falls in, has lost 2.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Philip Morris is expected to post earnings of $1.46 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -9.6%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.20 points to a change of +3.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.7%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.75 indicates a change of +8.8% from what Philip Morris is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Philip Morris is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Philip Morris, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $8.72 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +11.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $35.18 billion and $36.71 billion estimates indicate +10.8% and +4.3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPhilip Morris reported revenues of $8.1 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.6%. EPS of $1.38 for the same period compares with $1.56 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.08 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.3%. The EPS surprise was +3.76%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Philip Morris is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Philip Morris. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With a market capitalization of $77.6 billion, the average volume of shares traded in the last three months was 1.3 million.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRising patient volumes, acquisitions of hospitals or healthcare entities and a sound financial position continue to drive HCA Healthcare.The leading U.S. healthcare services provider, presently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has a decent track record of beating estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missing the same once, the average beat being 9.04%.Can HCA Retain the Momentum?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HCA Healthcare’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $18.09 per share, indicating a 7.1% increase from the 2022 reported figure. The same for revenues stands at $63.4 billion, suggesting a 5.3% increase from the year-ago figure. It has witnessed eight upward estimate revisions compared to none for 2023 earnings over the past 30 days.Growing patient volumes, the most significant contributor to a hospital stock’s top line, contribute to the revenue growth of HCA Healthcare. The efficient telehealth services of HCA also provide an impetus to its top line, considering the ongoing digitization across every sphere of life and the amount of ease and convenience that such services provide.An array of buyouts undertaken over the years continue to add hospitals and other medical facilities to the portfolio of HCA Healthcare. Simultaneously, growth-related initiatives have also diversified HCA’s income streams and bolstered its nationwide presence. As of Mar 31, 2023, its healthcare portfolio comprises 180 hospitals and roughly 2,300 ambulatory sites of care stretched across 20 states and the United Kingdom.The healthcare services provider does not shy away from selling unprofitable businesses in a bid to intensify focus on high-growth areas and boost profits.Story continuesThe cash reserves and adequate cash-generating abilities enable HCA Healthcare to undertake significant growth-related efforts and engage in the tactical deployment of capital through share buybacks and dividend payments. In January 2023, management sanctioned a new $3-billion share buyback plan and even hiked its quarterly dividend by 7.1%. Its dividend yield of 0.9% remains higher than the industry’s figure of 0.8%.HCA Healthcare boasts an impressive VGM Score of A.

The recalled formula was sold in three different sizes at retailers nationwide, according to a March 17 recall notice.Cooperative food wholesaler Associated Wholesale Grocers, however, distributed the 12.4-ounce version of the recalled product to its Nashville Division retailers after Perrigo's initial recall notice was published.As a result, the recalled product was distributed to supermarkets across Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia, according to Associated Wholesale Grocers.The wholesaler is urging consumers who purchased Gerber Good Start formula at impacted locations to check their products. The recalled formula sold beyond the start of the recall can be identified by its lot codes and “use by” dates — which range from July 4, 2024 to July 12, 2024.“Any consumers who purchased product with matching codes should discontinue use and dispose of the product,” Associated Wholesale Grocers' Saturday notice reads, adding that consumers can request a refund by contacting the Gerber Parent Resource Center on behalf of Perrigo.In a statement to The Associated Press on Tuesday, Perrigo said that the company informed all customers at the time of the March recall.The company added that “no Cronobacter sakazakii bacteria has been found in any product distributed for sale and no adverse events have been reported.”Story continuesAssociated Wholesale Grocers did not return calls for comment.Infections caused by Cronobacter sakazakii are rare, but they can be life-threatening for newborns, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention writes — noting that the bacteria can cause sepsis and meningitis.Cronobacter sakazakii was same germ that sparked Abbott Nutrition’s recall and following nationwide shortage of powdered infant formula last year. According to the FDA and CDC, Cronobacter sakazkii is found naturally in the environment and is “particularly good” at surviving in dry foods like infant formula — which can get contaminated at home or in processing facilities.“There are steps that people can take to prevent infections,” Dr. Julia Haston, a CDC expert in pediatric infectious diseases, previosuly told The Associated Press — including thoroughly washing, sanitizing and drying hands, equipment and all surfaces before feeding a baby._______AP National Reporter JoNel Aleccia contributed to this report.]"

Price and EPS SurpriseAmerican International Group, Inc. price-eps-surprise | American International Group, Inc. Quote The consensus estimate for 2023 revenues stands at $48.4 billion, suggesting a 6.6% rise from the year-ago reported figure.AIG’s transformative program named AIG 200 is enabling the company to make significant cost savings. This multi-year initiative is expected to continue boosting the company’s margins. Last year, it witnessed a major improvement in the expense ratio, which is expected to continue this year as well.The company’s investment income is expected to continue benefiting from the high interest rate environment. Rising yields generated from fixed maturity securities and loan portfolios continue to support its net investment income growth.AIG’s prudent capital allocation to buyouts and shareholder value addition is a major positive. It makes strategic acquisitions to scale businesses like Validus Holdings and Glatfelter Insurance Group, which are strengthening AIG’s global General Insurance business. It also does not shy away from divesting non-core assets to increase profitability.Story continuesIts capital-deployment efforts are likely to enhance shareholder value through share buybacks and dividend payouts. In the first quarter of 2023 alone, the company rewarded its shareholders with $603 million in repurchases and dividends worth $241 million. It recently boosted its quarterly cash dividend by 12.5% to 36 cents per common share. The company had $3 billion remaining under its share repurchase authorization as of Apr 28, 2023.RisksThere are a few factors that might mar American International’s prospects.American International's return on equity of 8.6% is lower than the industryaverage of 9.8%. This reflects AIG's relative inefficiency in utilizing its shareholders’ funds to generate profits. Also, its high leverage ratio (net debt-to-capital of 48% against the industry average of 3.1%) is concerning. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will drive AIG’s long-term growth.Other Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader finance space are Allianz SE ALIZY, Lemonade, Inc.

In the third quarter of 2022, the company acquired a 33% minority interest in Alexander Forbes Group Holdings Limited in South Africa. This investment is consistent with PRU’s strategic focus internationally on higher-growth emerging markets. The deal furthers the partnership’s specific objective to identify and make strategic investments in high-quality financial services companies in selected African geographies.PRU executed a number of strategic initiatives to reduce market sensitivity and increase growth potential, including the expansion of the cost-saving program.

It leverages new systems and technologies to enhance digital underwriting, claims and fund processing capabilities, thus improving efficiency.Prudential Financial’s solid financial position provides it with the flexibility to execute its transformation and invest in the long-term growth of businesses.PRU’s capital deployment is supported by its sturdy balance sheet strength that included highly liquid assets of $4.6 billion at the end of the first quarter and a capital position that continues to support an AA financial strength rating.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the multi-line insurance industry are American International Group, Inc.

First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. and we will open the floor for your questions and comments after the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Leonor Faber. Ma'am, the floor is yours.Leonor FaberThank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for iCAD's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. On the call today, we have Dana Brown, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Eric Lonngvist, our Chief Financial Officer. Before turning the call over to Dana, I would like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on the call today. These forward-looking statements are based on iCAD's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations. For a list of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see today's press release and our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. iCAD undertakes no obligation to revise or update any statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this conference call. I would also note that management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that these measures provide meaningful information for investors and reflect the way they view the operating performance of the company. You can find a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP measures at the end of the earnings release. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dana.Story continuesDana R. Brownyou, Leonor, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's begin with our business update. As mentioned on our previous call, we are exploring strategic options for the Xoft business that could accelerate the accessibility of this technology and provide more focus and synergies to its growth. While we explore these options, we continue to operate the business and customers worldwide continue to treat patients with this targeted therapy. And while we retain staff to support sales and services, revenue for Q1 was 18% lower than our budget coming in at $1.43 million versus $1.7 million. Sales have slowed as customers and distributors are cautious about the business' future. To address these concerns, we've redeployed some internal resources to better support Xoft sales. I am pleased to report that the body of evidence supporting Xoft continues to grow. Compelling new research was published last quarter in the peer-reviewed Journal of Contemporary Brachytherapy. In the longest-term study of Xoft skin eBx to date, researchers confirmed Xoft is a safe and effective treatment for non-melanoma skin cancer with 98.9% of patients remaining recurrence-free at a median follow-up of 7.6 years. This study adds to the body of clinical evidence that puts Xoft Skin eBx on par with mode surgery in terms of safety, efficacy and reoccurrence rates, but with fewer side effects and more comfort and convenience for patients. We remain confident that the Xoft technology has the potential to positively impact the lives of cancer patients and the providers who care for them on a global scale. We'll provide further updates on its strategic options at the appropriate point in time. Turning to the detection side of our business. As mentioned on our prior earnings call, while both the therapy and detection lines of business have great market opportunity and potential, we believe our core competencies and focus need to be solely on detection and our strategy around AI. But before we go into Q1 results, I want to take just a moment to speak to this week's news. I'm sure many of you saw the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force announcement from earlier this week. They published new draft mammography guidelines, which recommend women of average risk begin screening mammography at age 40. With 20 million women in the U.S. between the ages of 40 to 49, these recommendations offer the potential for our technology to benefit more women and improve providers' ability to meet the increased demand for these services. However, although mammography is the gold standard for breast cancer screening, it can still miss about 20% of breast cancers present at the time of screening. Mammography also cannot determine a women's risk of cancer developing in the short or the long term, and the new guidelines do not specify how a woman would know if she's of average risk. Our breast AI suite comprised of detection, density and risk, maximizes the effectiveness of mammography. Our detection solution delivers up to 2x the clinical performance compared to leading competitors and is clinically proven to improve accuracy and efficiency for radiologists. In a recent study, our detection solution was shown to catch up to 23% more cancers that might have otherwise gone undetected. Our density solution not only meets the needs recently outlined by the FDA, but it has long been used worldwide to enhance patient care and personalized results. And our risk solution is up to 2.4x more accurate than traditional risk models. Our leading-edge AI portfolio is the only commercially available 360-degree solution clinically proven to assist clinicians in daily practice to detect more cancers, evaluate breast density and identify women at high risk of developing breast cancer. And with the recent U.S. Preventative Services Task Force guidelines, it's clear that our technology is more relevant than ever. So back to our Q1 updates. First of note, we strengthened our leadership team with seasoned leaders poised to execute our strategic vision and grow our business. In Q1 of this year, we brought on Bill Keyes as Senior Vice President, U.S. Commercial Sales. As a seasoned leader with more than 35 years of health care technology experience, Bill brings to the team a consistent track record in building and leading sales teams, driving growth via enterprise sales and expertise in software as a service. We also recently welcomed to the team Vasu Avadhanula as our new Chief Product Officer. I've worked with Vasu over the past several years and can attest that he's an outstanding leader with 25 years of product development, business analytics and technology innovation experience. Vasu most recently served as Vice President, Health Technology and Digital Transformation at Susan G. Komen. Vasu has a track record of turning new ideas into successful products that disrupt the status quo and enhance the customer experience. In his last role at Susan G. Komen, Vasu was instrumental in the success of Komen's direct-to-patient programs and services, including the development and launch of Komen Health Cloud, a software-as-a-service patient engagement platform as well as share procurers, the first patient-powered breast cancer research registry. I'm pleased to welcome him to our team and look forward to incorporating his unique perspective into our future [red map]. Continuing to strengthen our leadership team, we also recently welcomed Michelle Strong as our new Chief Operations Officer. With more than 25 years of experience in marketing and health care technology, most recently serving as Vice President of Marketing Strategy at Susan G. Komen. Michelle is a seasoned leader who excels as strategically building and growing organizations, tackling challenging initiatives and developing strategic partnerships. She specializes in the implementation of new business strategies that broaden awareness, bolster brand equity and drive revenue growth. Under Michelle's leadership, Komen's Brand Health experienced significant improvements year-over-year, resulting in increased revenues and stakeholder engagement to advance its mission to save lives from breast cancer. I'm pleased to welcome her to the team and confident that her unique set of skills and expertise will be instrumental in our go-to-market success. Additionally, I'm pleased to report that we've completed our search for a full-time CFO as the Board of Directors appointed Eric Lonnqvist as our new Chief Financial Officer. Eric has demonstrated strong financial acumen and a commitment to excellence in his most recent position as iCAD's Vice President of Financial Planning and Analysis. Eric has been with iCAD for over 3 years, and during that time, been a strong and stable leader through leadership and market changes. Eric's leadership style, combined with a strong financial and business acumen will be instrumental in leading the financial operations of the company. Eric has more than 15 years of finance and accounting experience in the medical device and technology industries, and you will hear more through Eric later on this call. The addition of these seasoned executives will accelerate key initiatives in the company's strategic plans, such as new partnerships with patient advocacy groups, pharmaceutical companies and payer organizations. With these important changes to our leadership team, we're confident we have the right people in the right roles at the right time to help us achieve our vision of offering the most pervasive and personalized breast screening AI technology. And while we work on these exciting transformations as a company, compelling new research continues to validate the benefits our Breast AI portfolio offers to clinicians and patients. In March, at the European Congress of Radiology meeting, commonly referred to as ECR, we were pleased to again see physicians share their real-world clinical experience and evidence that iCAD's breast AI suite has a positive impact on cancer detection and women's lives. In the research presentation session at the meeting, Dr. Kathy Schilling, the Medical Director of the Christine E. Lynn Women's Health and Wellness Institute at Boca Raton Regional Hospital presented findings from a study that found our ProFound AI detection solution increased the cancer detection rate among 9 dedicated breast imaging radiologists by 23% without increasing the rate of recalls. This improvement was so significant the media took note. Both Fox and CBS covered the study in nationally syndicated segments featuring iCAD and Dr. Schilling. Dr. Schilling will be sharing more about this research along with our clinical experience, best practices and compelling case studies demonstrating the unique benefits our technology offers and our upcoming profound insights, profound impact webinar on May 24. We invite all of you to join us for this webinar. New clinical evidence supporting ProFound AI risk was also published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology last quarter. According to the study findings, ProFound AI risk for 2D mammography is more accurate than Tyrer-Cuzick v8, a commonly used lifestyle risk model. And of note, our ProFound AI risk was found to be more accurate for both short-term and long-term risk assessments. Physicians have traditionally estimated breast cancer risk by examining the patient's known risk factors such as family history. But about 85% of breast cancers are current women who have no family history of breast cancer. Our risk solution accurately identified 20% of breast cancers as high risk compared to only 7.1% for Tyrer-Cuzick. With iCAD's risk solution, patient care has never been more personalized. By empowering radiologists with more information about a woman's specific risk, vacant tailor breast cancer screening and maximize mammography's effectiveness, which ultimately leads to finding cancer sooner, reducing cost to the overall health care system and most importantly, saving lives. Also in the first quarter, the FDA announced the implementation of a national dense breast reporting standard, which is a significant advancement in health care for women as nearly 50% of all women aged 40 and over have dense breasts, one of the strongest and most prevalent breast cancer risk factors. However, dense breast notifications are only as effective as the assessment themselves as studies show wide variation in visual assessment agreement, and radiologists may even disagree with their own assessment year-to-year. This can be confusing for patients, lead to unnecessary additional imaging and increase patient and facility costs. iCAD's Breast II suite empowers clinicians to lead the way in breast care. And our customers using our density assessment solutions are well equipped to provide accurate breast density assessments, and we expect more facilities to demand this technology as they work to bring care standards in line with new federal regulations. Turning now to our operations outside of the U.S. As I just mentioned, Q1 was marked by a very well-attended ECR meeting in Vienna. We connected many of our distributors with potential customers from all over the world. We also hosted a special evening event featuring talks from renowned leaders in breast imaging AI, including Dr. Kathy Schilling and Dr. Axel Grawingholt, who shared compelling testimonies and clinical case studies demonstrating the power of our technology to an audience of more than 100 radiologists. Also, our team was pleased to partner with GE in a workshop for radiologists. On the sales side, iCAD will be expanding into one of the largest screening regions in German-speaking Switzerland. This will be the first screening program that will use ProFound AI detection and ProFound AI risk in their review process. With the expansion of our distribution territories, iCAD's visibility continues to grow on a global scale. Our regional partners are bringing in larger and more significant opportunities, and we're seeing a significant uptake in demand for our subscription offering in Europe, where this is quickly becoming the preferred purchasing model. And lastly, before we move to the financial update, I also want to provide you a brief update on our business model transition. As noted on our last call, we implemented several strategic changes, including continued cost reduction measures to align and streamline our cost base, reducing annualized expenses by $4.3 million to $4.6 million and annualized cash burn by $4.9 million to $5.2 million, putting us on track to achieve our goal of profitability exiting 2024. We also noted on our last earnings call, we will revisit our subscription annual recurring revenue, or SAAR metric when subscription deals make up a more material and consistent portion of our revenue. Along these lines, we're pleased to report that we closed 9 subscription deals in Q1. While we believe the move to a subscription-based license model is good for our long-term future as it builds a more predictable and profitable revenue stream, it does create a short-term impact on revenue because we're only able to recognize a small portion of total revenue spread across the contract term. I also mentioned on the last call and earlier today that we're going through a rigorous and thoughtful process to evaluate a range of growth opportunities. To recap, these include going direct to patients with offerings like a new GPT powered digital care platform, access to elective risk assessments and other personalized predictive scoring solutions, pursuing payer and reimbursement strategies to get risk assessments and AI red screenings covered, partnering with large employers with women's health initiatives to provide AI-powered mobile screening services on campus. -- supporting patient advocacy organizations on the front lines of tackling health disparities and utilizing AI programs to help all women get access to the breast health care they need and expanding our cloud-based AI platform to address other cancers and modalities. In summary, we're making bold moves to rapidly transform this company with a focus on stability, preserving cash and building a defensible and competitive long-term strategy that diversifies our revenue stream and smooth out our customer concentration. We look forward to continuing to update you on the metrics and milestones of the strategy later this year. I'll now turn the call over to Eric for a detailed review of our Q1 2023 financials.Eric LonnqvistGood afternoon, everyone, and thank you, Dana. I'll now summarize our financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2023. The Total revenue for the quarter was $5.8 million, a decline of $1.7 million or 23% from the first quarter of 2022. The Detection segment revenue was $4.3 million, down 21% from last year. Within detection, first quarter 2023 product revenue was $2.5 million, down 36% over the prior year. A portion of the decline is attributable to a greater number of subscription deals for the quarter over the prior year. Detection service revenue was $1.9 million, up to 13% over the prior year. From a regional standpoint, Detection segment revenue for the U.S. was $3.7 million, a decline of 19% from the first quarter of 2022. The Detection segment revenue for [OUS]was $0.6 million, a decline of 35% from the first quarter of 2022. The therapy segment revenue was $1.4 million, down $0.6 million or 28% versus the first quarter of 2022. Therapy product revenue was $0.3 million, down 59% year-over-year. Services revenue was $1.2 million, down 11% year-over-year. Moving on to gross profit. On a percentage of revenue basis, gross profit was 71% for the first quarter of 2023, which was in line with the first quarter of 2022. On a pure dollar basis, gross profit for the quarter was $4.1 million as compared to $5.3 million last year. This is largely reflective of a reduction in revenues. Total operating expenses for the first quarter -- for the first quarter ended March 31, 2023, versus $3.5 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2022. GAAP net loss for the first quarter of 2023 was $3.8 million or $0.15 per diluted share compared with a GAAP net loss of $3.5 million or $0.14 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2022. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2023 was a loss of $3 million versus $2.7 million in Q1 2022. Non-GAAP adjusted net loss for the quarter was $3.6 million or $0.14 per diluted share compared to $3.5 million or $0.14 per diluted share in Q1 of 2022, reflecting a few adjustments to GAAP net loss in each period. Moving on to the balance sheet. As of March 31, 2023, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $19.6 million compared to cash and cash equivalents of $29.8 million on March 31, 2022. This concludes the financial highlights of our presentation. I'd like to now turn the call back over to the operator to lead the Q&amp;A.Question and Answer SessionOperatorCertainly. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Your first question is coming from Per Ostlund from Craig-Hallum.Per Erik OstlundThank you. Congratulations, Eric, on your elevation into the new role. So, we're only about 6 weeks removed from your fourth quarter call and obviously, a lot of sweeping change in the shadow of that. So, I think maybe a little bit unfair for us to ask too many questions about change since, but I guess we kind of have to. So, I'm curious if we can start with the therapy side since you are evaluating strategic alternatives there, is there anything you can do to characterize some of the early discussions that you had or the level of interest you think you've found -- has it been kind of meeting expectations, exceeding expectations? If a sale is the ultimate end game there? How are you kind of thinking about valuation?Dana R. BrownPer. So thanks for the question and no worries on if they're unfair in terms of the territory. So maybe like you said, some adjectives right, to kind of describe the conversations. I will say they're plural. So that's good. We have multiple parties that we're in discussion with. The downside is it does take time to respond to all their questions. The parties are in what we're characterizing as Phase I due diligence, which lets them firm up their proposal to us, right? So, their financial proposal. I think about the time frame that would be required to actually put things in writing in terms of like a definitive agreement. So, it's good. We've got multiple parties. They're at the same phase. Nothing is definitive yet. So, it's a little bit late and see. But I think we feel good about it. I think understanding the business and the potential for it with the customer base, we get to be on the front lines of hearing testimonials for that every day. So naturally, we're probably going to think that it can always be valued for more once somebody really understands the potential for it. But I think so far, we're pretty pleased. And everybody is coming in around the same numbers, the same dots, right, if you were to plot them on a graph. So, it's been consistent there.Per Erik OstlundOkay. Maybe just a quick follow-on to that. Is there -- if we're talking about Phase 1 diligence -- is it still reasonable to think that a second quarter outcome, maybe it's not a completion, but a second quarter outcome where you know what the end of the process is going to look like and then you're in a position to make a decision on the furlough and then those sorts of things. Is that still kind of the target?Dana R. BrownYes. Yes, that's definitely still the target. We still feel good about that. One never knows if something may pop up, but there's no indicators, right, otherwise at this point. So, it still feels good. Like you said, I think it will take -- they always will take a little bit longer than expected to get through legal agreements and actual closing. But if we keep staying on track, then we feel good.Per Erik OstlundOkay. Very good. I want to ask you a question about therapy. And I think that -- because you alluded to this last call, Dana, and I'm intrigued by it when you're talking about evaluating programs with patient advocacy groups and large employers and what have you. I think historically, I don't want to speak for everybody, I think, but I think historically, in our community, we've kind of taken to thinking of the sale as a sale to a radiology practice, whether it's and sole or whoever it is, radiology partners. How does it look when you're not selling it to somebody like that? Because I think that it's a very creative way, potentially creative way to go about [proliferating] the technology. But how do you do that and how do you get paid for it?Dana R. BrownYes. At the beginning of the question, I think you said therapy that you're meaning detection.Per Erik OstlundThat's the action for sure. Yes.Dana R. BrownGreat. No worries. Yes. So, we are aggressively exploring those options. I think from our experience at Susan G. Komen, we know what it takes to provide technology and, I'll say, cancer-related support programs and services directly in the hands of patients and directly in the hands of employers that want to put in place health and wellness initiatives, especially for women who may be employed by them. So how we get paid for those 2 types of programs could span a variety of methods. -- very simply, there's a lot of precedent already being set in the medical community, direct-to-patient, maybe home health test kits or assessment. We've seen a lot of that with genetic testing. The good news is our patients are able to get their mammography images today and they can move them between provider to provider, so enabling us to have access to their images isn't a lot different than an already existing process that the patient has to get access to their images. And then just web portals, web-based payment cards, that's kind of the approach that we would take there. For large employers, it's typically something that they provide as a program basis to their entire staff. So, something that's out of a benefit type of budget and HR type of budget. So that's how we'll be looking, right, to be compensated in that regard.Per Erik OstlundOkay. Okay. One last one, if I can. So, there's been a substantial cut in expenses and then in the cash burn and the target there is to have that get you to profitability. Again, this is another one of those that's very, very early, but do you feel like the cuts that you've made is sufficient to get you to that target without, I guess, let's say, underinvesting in the business.Dana R. BrownYes, it's a great question. When we think about every day. So if we were to embark on one of these new strategic initiatives, like a bold diversification of the revenue stream, then there may be a corresponding investment rate, some cash we need to burn in order to build, right, the necessary programs or technologies to do that. So, if we decide to go that route, then that's something that when I talked about analyzing the strategic alternatives, I mentioned we were going to update metrics and milestones on the third quarter call, which would be happening in fourth quarter this calendar year. So, at that point in time, we might revise it, but we would be able to tell you the reason why. This is what we think opening up this part of the market would mean to our business and the type of growth that we would expect. But if we just continue, as you said, we're selling to radiologists to large (inaudible) centers to health networks with the set of solutions that we have today, then we do think those cuts are what was needed, and we're able to run the business and still achieve that target of exiting 2024 being breakeven, right, or cash flow positive.Per Erik OstlundOkay. Sounds good. Thank you, Dan. I appreciate it.Dana R. BrownYes.OperatorYour next question is coming from Marie ibet from BTIG.Marie Yoko ThibaultAnd Eric I wanted to ask my first hear about the Xoft business. You mentioned at the start of the call that it came in about 18% below your internal plan. How should we think about the very near term for Xoft we continue to think about sort of minimal to no new product sales in that business while you work through the strategic alternatives and the furlough plans?Dana R. BrownI'm going to let Eric chime in here as well. But I think just at the high level, yes, I would think of Xoft as being just stable and kind of flat, so not new growth in terms of either new product sales or new customers in that business in the short term. But we definitely want to get Eric's point of view as well.Eric LonnqvistMarie, I think that I would echo what Dana said, largely remaining having revenue remained flat in Q2. We did pull a little bit of more help to work on the source and service revenue in Q2. I think we had a bit of a dip in Q1 as some of the furloughed resources were pulled off of that. So, we're trying to remedy that this quarter with a little more proactive calling and working with customers for balloon and source orders and so forth. But I think flattish in Q2 from Q1 is a good way to go.Marie Yoko ThibaultOkay. That's helpful. And then as sort of a follow-up to that, Eric, I know you're very new in the seat. But I'm curious if this understanding that, obviously, the subscription model, you won't be able to give us more detail on. But do you think iCAD will be able to return to offering revenue guidance at some point as you get settled in the seat?Eric LonnqvistYes. I think, Dana, if you want me to answer that one, we've had conversations about that, and we continue to -- I think a lot of the target as far as timing for how things will be going forward with the new management team is Q3. So, I think by then, we'll have a clearer picture of what we can give for guidance going forward and we'll have some more stability as far as the plan going forward at that point. So, I think in the near term, I don't think we'll be providing revenue guidance for this quarter and probably next. But I do foresee in the future where we'll be stable enough with the new team that we may be able to have that discussion and determine if we can give more guidance going forward.OperatorYour next question is coming from Yale Jen from Laidlaw &amp; Company.I-Eh JenAnd my first question, Dana, is that you mentioned about night deal signed in the first quarter. Could you give us a little bit color in terms of whether that sort of meet your expectations exceed it or something you want to further work on? And I know you don't give guidance, but -- how would you see that -- whether that could be something you can think about for remaining of the year? Or will we have more rapid growth going to the rest of the year? And then I have a follow-up.Dana R. BrownOkay. Sure. And Eric, I'm going to ask you to chime in on this as well. But from my point of view, the 9 subscription deals in Q1, I think, was fantastic. So definitely pleased with that. Our new sales leader, his name is Bill talked about it in my comments. He's putting a lot of discipline in place with the sales team. He has revamped the comp plan to, I think, give us the right incentives to achieve a healthy mix between perpetual licenses and subscription licenses. So, I think it was a great success for Q1. I think we're doing well here in the middle of Q2. I can't make the call yet, but I think we're pleased with those results. Eric has a bit more of a historical perspective. He's been with iCAD for 3 years. So, I just stepped into this role, I guess, just now 60 days ago. So, I would love to hear his point of view on if the 9 deals in the first quarter met expectations exceeded, just how he's thinking about it.Eric LonnqvistYes. The 9 deals in the associated annual recurring revenue with them was above budget globally. So, it was good. It was a pleasing quarter. I think particularly on the OUS side, 5 of those 9 deals were OUS related. And they had -- one of the deals was their largest deal they've had to date. So, we have seen a faster shift to subscription in OUS, and that trend is continuing and starting to accelerate a little bit. Q2, at this point, like Dana said, we don't know yet. But as of right now, it looks like a stronger quarter than Q1 in U.S. and OUS as far as subscription deals. We have a couple of deals that would be among the biggest we've had to date. So still forecast, but the trend is encouraging as far as the shift to subscription.I-Eh JenOkay. Great. Congress on that. And maybe just one more question here, which is more 10,000 feet, which is that in terms of transition is ongoing at the moment. And Eric, you sort of mentioned that maybe starting from the third quarter, you might give some guidance. Just curious whether do you feel that -- so overall, is the transition getting to a more mature stage by third quarter or maybe in the fourth quarter that you will have more confidence or more visibility to talk about...Dana R. BrownYes, Eric, if you want to go ahead and address that one.Eric LonnqvistSure. I think that time line, there's a lot of talks with the new management team about potential diversification of revenue streams and projects that we need to discuss internally and with our Board. And I just think a lot of that will become clearer by the time we get to Q3 is kind of where I'm going as far as clarity. Of course, there will be 2 more quarters out in terms of what's going to happen with Xoft. I would expect we'll have a very clear picture by then. We'll have 2 more quarters behind us in terms of our transition to subscription. There's a lot of discussion there. We have a new sales leader. We have some more executive management. And I think -- I just think we'll be -- we should be on the same page by Q3 with all these kind of impactful decisions to make about firming up or actions to go in a lot of these areas.I-Eh JenOkay. Great. And again, congrats Eric and for your new position and thanks for the guidance.OperatorThank you. Your next question is coming from Frank Takkinen from Lake Street Capital Markets.Frank James TakkinenMaybe just to start, could you provide us an update on the Google Health partnership as well as the radiology partners partnership? Just what's the latest there? Any change in strategy specifically behind those partnerships? And kind of what should we be looking for over the next 12 months within those?Dana R. BrownYes. So, the Google Health partnership is primarily a technology partnership right, is a development agreement. So, the technology is on track. So, we're pleased with that. There's no major shifts. I would say it's just engineers kind of heads down and building a lot of technology and the algorithms. So that's great. On the Red partners, we have not signed the contract with them yet. But it's -- I would say, it's for a good reason because we've discovered in our testing that we actually had some technology that enabled I'll say, their cloud, their performance processing time to be greatly increased, speeded up. So that was fabulous. And because of that, they actually went to license some additional technology from us. It's actually a part of the technology that we're building in concert with Google, right? So, with our cloud, our commercial cloud platform. So, we had to press pause a bit because we needed to do some more homework and kind of accelerate some of that development so that we could actually provide it as a piece of stand-alone technology within the [Red Partners] cloud, so what they call their RPX. So that was a bit of a slowdown that we put on our side because we didn't want to be rushed thinking about how we wanted to license and price that for it, make sure that we were really kind of future-proofing the agreement. But as far as any other terms in the agreement that are outstanding, it's just down to small eyes and crossing small Ps. So that looks well. They are continuing to bring us into deals. So, we are actively partnering with them in the field. It's just the actual paperwork is lagging a bit behind.Frank James TakkinenOkay. That's helpful. And then just for my second one. Maybe any update you can provide around the around the initiatives to go after Hologic. I know predates your position, but I know there was previously a lot of focus to go after some of the Hologic accounts just given the big bolus of systems that they own on the field. So maybe just any update on going after those and whether you see if Hologic is taking share on the AI front with their system that they include in their scanners.Dana R. BrownWe don't have a, I'll call it, a specific campaign, right, or approach around Hologic at least not at this point in time. Like you said, there may have been some that predate my involvement with the company. But I would say from a competitive standpoint, we don't see them any more than we would have in the past. I would say the common set of folks that we hear about here in the U.S. are primarily screen point, right? So, we'll hear about screen point of deals against us. From a European standpoint, we do see Lunit a little bit more Therepixel. So, it's kind of the same set, so the competition is happening more so from the independent AI software companies than Hologic in their embedded technology.Frank James TakkinenOkay. That's good color. I'll stop there.OperatorYour next question is coming from Frank Brisebois from Oppenheimer.François Daniel BriseboisJust a quick one here. In terms of the SaaS transition model, is this something that we want to completely transition to set? Or how do we deal with accounts that may be like the perpetual license? Is that understood in the new comp program from the sales force?Dana R. BrownYes. Yes. So, I'll chime in and then Eric, if there's anything additional you want to add, please do. But Frank, you're right. I think for the foreseeable future, we're always going to live in a both world, right? So, we're going to have accounts. We still see them today that want perpetual. They want it on-premise, it meets their operational as well as their security requirements. And then we have accounts that want cloud-based. So, we're not planning on, I'll say, end of lifing or discontinuing the perpetual on-prem model. We need to have that available. We've obviously got a large installed base. So, in terms of software upgrades, maintenance and support. So, you'll see both. But what we do think is that over time, this mix, right? If you could envision a pie chart, how much of the pie is perpetual versus how much is subscription. That's what we're closely watching and leveraging the way in which we're motivating and compensating the sales force to drive that shift or that mix between those 2 pie slices at the right rate. So close watch on cash and what it does to revenue.Eric LonnqvistYes, I can add a little bit if it will help, too. I think you'll see this kind of a slow and steady move to subscription over the course of the year. we're trying to strike that right balance between not going too fast or too slow to the transition because of the cash and revenue implications that Dana touched on. So, the comp plan to [incent] perpetual and subscription somewhat separately, but it's all geared towards an ACV metric for the reps. So, they are getting in kind of that annual recurring revenue kind of mindset, but we do anticipate a strong mix. It's not going to shift overnight.OperatorThank you. That concludes our Q&amp;A session. I will now hand the conference back to Dana Brown for closing remarks. Please go ahead.Dana R. BrownThank you, operator. In conclusion, we're making bold moves to rapidly transform this company with a focus on stability, preserving cash and building a defensible and competitive long-term strategy that diversifies our revenue stream and smooth out our customer concentration. Demand for our technology continues to be strong. The evidence supporting it continues to grow, and we're continuing to strengthen our team. I remain optimistic about the company and its future, and I'm confident we're taking the right steps to ensure continued growth and create additional shareholder value. I look forward to updating you next quarter as we continue to get clarity on our strategy, expand our partnerships and drive towards increased shareholder value. Thank you, and have a great evening.OperatorThank you, everyone. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.]"

(Nasdaq: HOLX), a global leader in women's health, announced a new partnership with recently drafted NFL cornerback Kelee Ringo and his mother, breast cancer survivor Tralee Hale, to educate women on the importance of prioritizing annual mammograms and other key health screenings.Ringo is a two-time national champion from the University of Georgia who was recently drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles. The launch of the partnership with Hologic is timed with Mother's Day and National Women's Health Week (May 14-20, 2023).Hale's story is a familiar one: a woman who did not prioritize her preventive care screenings as she focused on managing her family, career and other commitments. As a single mother, she was diagnosed with breast cancer just days after Ringo began his freshman year in college. She is now cancer-free after completing treatment, but Ringo and Hale know how lucky they are and want to encourage women not to delay annual screenings.""Kelee and Tralee's story resonates with all of us because we have heard from women — time and again — who have prioritized their families and other responsibilities while putting their own health screenings on the back burner,"" said Erik Anderson, Hologic's Division President of Breast and Skeletal Health Solutions. ""We couldn't be more grateful that they are sharing their personal story as a way to reach women about the critical importance of annual breast cancer screenings and making their health a priority.""Hologic, a pioneer in 3D mammography and creator of the Genius® 3D Mammography™ exam, is committed to increasing awareness about the life-saving power of annual mammograms and other routine health screenings. The partnership with Ringo and Hale will further that impact through media interviews, public appearances and digital content.Media ContactGina Kentgkent@vaultcommunications.comStory continuesCisionView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hologic-announces-partnership-with-nfl-rookie-kelee-ringo-and-family-301825327.htmlSOURCE Hologic, Inc.]"

HSIC is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, backed by strategic acquisitions and the robust performance of the dental business worldwide. The company’s Technology and Value-Added Services segment significantly contributed to the first-quarter top line with the strength of Henry Schein One — a joint venture with Internet Brands.However, lower sales of PPE and COVID-19 test kits and escalating expenses do not bode well for the company.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has declined 9.5% compared to the 7.1% rise of the industry and a 1% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The leading distributor of healthcare products and services has a market capitalization of $10.03 billion. Henry Schein’s PE ratio of 14.53 compares favorably with the industry’s 28.10 and the S&amp;P 500’s 19.67.HSIC surpassed estimates in two of the trailing four quarters and matched the same in one, delivering an average earnings surprise of 0.51%. In the last reported quarter, the company missed the consensus estimate for earnings by 2.42%.Let’s delve deeper.UpsidesValue-Added Acquisitions: Henry Schein has a robust pipeline for acquisitions, instilling optimism about the stock. Last month, the company signed a definitive agreement to acquire S.I.N. Implant System, one of Brazil’s leading manufacturers of dental implants. The announcement marks HSIC’s planned entry into Brazil’s large implant market. The company has been serving the country’s dental practitioners since 2014.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHenry Schein completed its majority share acquisition of Biotech Dental in April 2022, expanding its comprehensive integrated suite of planning and diagnostic software and dental implants and Clear Aligners portfolio. In May, HSIC announced the acquisition of Regional Health Care Group, a medical product distribution company serving customers in Australia and New Zealand. The addition will leverage the countries’ infrastructure to expand HSIC’s offering to medical practitioners in the region.Story continuesContributions From the Dental Business: In the first quarter of 2023, Henry Schein reported a 3.8% year-over-year increase in global Dental sales to $1.9 billion. The dental distribution business was fueled by an aging global population and the growing awareness of the benefits of preventative care and oral hygiene.Of the dental equipment, traditional equipment sales grew strongly in contrast to digital equipment comprising 2D, 3D digital imaging, mills and intra-oral scanners. The global bookings of traditional equipment remained robust and rose year-over-year.Within HSIC’s Global Dental Specialty business, implant sales growth was driven by the premium Camlog product line in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.Technology and Value-Added Services Business: Within the segment, the largest component — Henry Schein One — reported both domestic and international growth in the first quarter of 2023.North America registered strong sales of Dentrix and Dentrix Ascend cloud-based solutions and a customer shift from the Easy Dental product, with the Easy Dental lifecycle ending later this year. Internationally, the growth was fully supported by cloud-based solutions, particularly in Australia and New Zealand, where it was recently launched. During the first-quarter earnings call, HSIC noted that its customer base for Dentrix and Dentrix Ascend increased nearly 30% from the prior year.Recently, the company announced the full integration of AI solutions into Dentrix Ascend —the company’s cloud-based practice management software. The solutions Dentrix Ascend Detect AI and Dentrix Ascend Voice offer powerful tools to help dental professionals improve case acceptance and elevate patient care through accurate diagnoses.DownsidesPPE &amp; COVID-19 Test Kit Sales Continue to Decline: Lower sales of PPE products and COVID test kits continue to impact Henry Schein’s overall top line. The company reported a 35% year-over-year decrease in sales of PPE products and an approximately 80% year-over-year decline in COVID-19 test kit sales in the first quarter of 2023.HSIC also maintained its original 2023 guidance of a 20%-25% decline in PPE product sales.Mounting Expenses Put Pressure: Mounting operating expenses negatively affected the company’s adjusted operating margin in the first quarter. The contraction was mainly due to lower gross profit dollars from PPE and COVID-19 test kit sales and higher acquisition-related costs, partially offset by a gross margin rate improvement.Estimate TrendHenry Schein has been witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for 2023. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has remained constant at $5.32 in the past 60 days and has moved 1.1% south to $5.26 in the past seven days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $12.84 billion, suggesting a 1.5% decline from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Zimmer Biomet ZBH, Penumbra PEN and Hologic, Inc. HOLX.Zimmer Biomet, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present, has an earnings yield of 5.42% compared to the industry’s -1.86%.

(HOLX) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hologic-inc-holx-trending-stock-130001862.html,1684242001,STORY,['HOLX'],"[Hologic (HOLX) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this medical device maker have returned -1.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.1% change. The Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, to which Hologic belongs, has gained 0.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Hologic is expected to post earnings of $0.88 per share, indicating a change of -7.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.7% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.87 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -35.7%. This estimate has changed +4.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.08 indicates a change of +5.4% from what Hologic is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Hologic.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for HOLX _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Hologic, the consensus sales estimate of $956.07 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -4.7%. The $4 billion and $4.15 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -17.8% and +3.8%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryHologic reported revenues of $1.03 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -28.5%. EPS of $1.06 for the same period compares with $2.07 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $967.05 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.15%. The EPS surprise was +20.45%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Hologic is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Hologic. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

""Ultimately, we are optimistic about theatrical,"" said Wilson.AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc this month reported positive quarterly results boosted by ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie,"" and the world's largest cinema chain operator said it expected ""The Little Mermaid"", ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" and ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" to generate box-office sales for the rest of the year.However, Brian O'Shea, CEO at The Exchange, based in Los Angeles, did not see as much cause for optimism in the numbers.""The box office that is beneficial to independent film is depressed"" as it is primarily older viewers, who wanted to avoid getting sick during the coronavirus pandemic, and have become used to watching movies from the comfort of home, he said.Story continues""It's a transitional time on the business side as the traditional business model that independent buyers use sees lessened value,"" said O'Shea.Global film companies like the Walt Disney Co, Paramount and Warner Bros joined the streaming revolution to counter the threat posed by Netflix Inc to traditional TV but are now facing a crowded market where the competition to increase subscriber numbers is fierce.""Everybody's been really focused on the shock impact of the streamer contraction ... but the other thing it does for traditional theatrical distribution is narrow the focus of what the streamers are doing and what kind of film they want to do and how they want to do them, so for everything else there's ... space for counterprogramming,"" Brown said.The similarity among much of the content offered on streaming platforms leaves theatre audiences wanting something different, an unmet appetite that independent companies could fulfil, he said.Proof of that argument is how well last year's ""Triangle of Sadness"" and ""Joyland"" did in Europe, and ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" in the United States and worldwide. ""Those are movies that are radically not streamer movies,"" said Brown.However, in one sign that streamers are focusing more on cinema in a bid to stand out from the crowd, Apple Inc will premiere Martin Scorsese's ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" starring Leonardo DiCaprio at Cannes and has teamed up with Paramount to release the film in theatres before streaming it globally in October.""Something good is happening, and I'm sure other streaming services will follow suit,"" Cannes Film Festival director Thierry Fremaux said in an interview with Le Film francais magazine in April.

The company initially tolerated the practice but has been cracking down on it in an effort to revive flagging growth.The streaming giant is planning to tighten its rules in the UK later this month.Users will be asked to set a “primary location” where they generally watch. Netflix will then use Wi-Fi addresses to tell if an account is being accessed at more than one address.Customers will face a monthly charge on top of their existing subscription for every additional household where the account is used.It means parents who share a Netflix account with children who have gone to university must pay more, for example.In Canada, where the crackdown began, Netflix charges an additional C$7.99 per month per person. In New Zealand the cost is NZ$7.99, while it is €3.99 in Portugal and €5.99 in Spain.The company has said customers in more “affluent” countries will face higher fees for legal password sharing.Netflix is braced for a torrent of complaints as it prepares for the crackdown. Ahead of the change, it has held talks with telecoms providers including BT, Virgin Media, Sky and Talktalk to warn of a flood of angry calls that are expected, the Financial Times reported.It is common for telecoms companies to offer content bundles that include a Netflix subscription.Around 4 million of Netflix’s total 15 million customers in the UK are believed to share their passwords, according to research company Digital i.But an initial backlash against Netflix’s crackdown has prompted the company to delay the move in some countries from the first to the second quarter of this year.The streaming behemoth said that sharing restrictions in Spain, Portugal, Canada and New Zealand had triggered a “cancel reaction”, where customers had simply dropped their subscription rather than agreeing to pay any extra fees.Despite this, the company insisted that most customers began paying the extra fees following the initial drop-off, convincing bosses to press ahead.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

(NYSE: TJX), the leading off-price apparel and home fashions retailer in the U.S. and worldwide, today announced sales and operating results for the first quarter ended April 29, 2023. Net sales for the first quarter of Fiscal 2024 were $11.8 billion, an increase of 3% versus the first quarter of Fiscal 2023. Overall comp store sales increased 3%. Net income for the first quarter of Fiscal 2024 was $891 million and diluted earnings per share were $.76, up 55% versus $.49 in the first quarter of Fiscal 2023. First quarter Fiscal 2024 diluted earnings per share were up 12% versus last year’s first quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share of $.68, which excluded a $.19 charge related to a write-down of the Company’s minority investment in Familia.CEO and President CommentsErnie Herrman, Chief Executive Officer and President of The TJX Companies, Inc., stated, ""I am very pleased with our first quarter performance. Our pretax profit margin and earnings per share both significantly exceeded our plan and our 3% comparable store sales increase was at the high end of our plan. Our comp sales growth was driven by an increase in overall customer traffic and a 5% comp sales increase at Marmaxx, our largest division. HomeGoods’ comp sales were down following extraordinary growth during the pandemic. TJX Canada and TJX International both delivered comp sales growth and customer traffic increases. With our above-plan profit performance we are raising our full-year guidance for both pretax profit margin and earnings per share. The strength and flexibility of our off-price business model, depth of our organization’s expertise, and our wide demographic reach all give me great confidence in our ability to continue to succeed in today’s retail environment. Every day, our global organization is focused on bringing customers around the world excellent values on great fashions and great brands and an exciting, treasure-hunt shopping experience. We are pleased that the second quarter is off to a good start and we are seeing phenomenal off-price buying opportunities in the marketplace. We are set up extremely well to continue shipping fresh and compelling merchandise to our stores and online throughout the spring and summer. Going forward, I am confident that we have significant opportunities to grow sales, drive customer traffic, capture market share, and improve the profitability of our company.""Story continuesComparable Store Sales (FY2024 and FY2023) and Open-Only Comparable Store Sales (FY2022)The Company’s comparable store sales by division in the first quarter of Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2023, and open-only comparable store sales by division in the first quarter of Fiscal 2022 were as follows:First QuarterFY2024Comparable StoreSales1First QuarterFY2023 U.S.Comparable StoreSales1First QuarterFY2022Open-OnlyComparable StoreSales1,2Marmaxx (U.S.)3+5%+3%+12%HomeGoods (U.S.)4-7%-7%+40%TJX Canada+1%N.A.+9%TJX International (Europe &amp; Australia)+4%N.A.+11%TJX+3%N.A.+16%1Comparable store sales exclude e-commerce sites (tjmaxx.com, marshalls.com, homegoods.com, sierra.com, and tkmaxx.com). 2This measure reports the sales increase or decrease of stores classified as comp stores at the beginning of Fiscal 2021 for the days they were open in the first quarter of Fiscal 2022 against sales of those stores for the same days in Fiscal 2020, prior to the emergence of the COVID-19 global pandemic. 3Combination of Marmaxx (T.J.

First quarter Fiscal 2024 pretax profit margin was up 0.9 percentage points versus last year’s first quarter adjusted pretax profit margin of 9.4%, which excluded a 1.9 percentage point negative impact from a charge related to a write-down of the Company’s minority investment in Familia. The Company’s above plan pretax profit margin was primarily driven by a larger than expected benefit from freight as well as the timing of some expenses.Gross profit margin for the first quarter of Fiscal 2024 was 28.9%, a 1.0 percentage point increase versus the first quarter of Fiscal 2023. Merchandise margin increased and was driven by a significant benefit from lower freight costs and strong markon from better buying. Selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) costs as a percent of sales for the first quarter of Fiscal 2024 were 19.0%, a 0.6 percentage point increase versus the first quarter of Fiscal 2023. Net interest income benefitted first quarter Fiscal 2024 pretax profit margin by 0.5 percentage points versus the prior year.Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange RatesChanges in foreign currency exchange rates affect the translation of sales and earnings of the Company’s international businesses into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. In addition, ordinary course, inventory-related hedging instruments are marked to market at the end of each quarter. Changes in currency exchange rates can have a material effect on the magnitude of these translations and adjustments when there is significant volatility in currency exchange rates. Given the global operations of the Company, to facilitate comparability, the Company has provided sales growth and inventory on a constant currency basis, which assumes a constant exchange rate between periods for translation based on the rate in effect for the prior period.The movement in foreign currency exchange rates had a 1.3 percentage point negative impact on the Company’s net sales growth in the first quarter of Fiscal 2024 versus the prior year. The overall net impact of foreign currency exchange rates had a neutral impact on first quarter Fiscal 2024 diluted earnings per share.A table detailing the impact of foreign currency on TJX’s pretax earnings and margins, as well as those of its international businesses, can be found in the Investors section of TJX.com.The foreign currency exchange rate impact to earnings per share does not include the impact currency exchange rates have on various transactions, which the Company refers to as ""transactional foreign exchange.""InventoryTotal inventories as of April 29, 2023 were $6.4 billion, compared to $7.0 billion at the end of the first quarter of Fiscal 2023. As a reminder, total inventories in the first quarter of Fiscal 2023 were elevated primarily due to a larger in-transit balance as a result of supply chain delays. Consolidated inventories on a per-store basis as of April 29, 2023, including distribution centers, but excluding inventory in transit, the Company’s e-commerce sites, and Sierra stores, were down 5% on a reported basis (with inventory on a constant currency basis down 4%, which reflects inventory adjusted for the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, as described above). The Company is confident it is well-positioned to take advantage of the outstanding availability of quality, branded merchandise in the marketplace and flow fresh merchandise to its stores and online throughout the spring and summer.Cash and Shareholder DistributionsFor the first quarter of Fiscal 2024, the Company generated $745 million of operating cash flow and ended the quarter with $5.0 billion of cash.During the first quarter of Fiscal 2024, the Company returned $841 million to shareholders. The Company repurchased a total of $500 million of TJX stock, retiring 6.5 million shares, and paid $341 million in shareholder dividends during the quarter. The Company continues to expect to repurchase approximately $2.0 to $2.5 billion of TJX stock during the fiscal year ending February 3, 2024. The Company may adjust this amount up or down depending on various factors. In addition, the Company increased its dividend by 13% in the first quarter of Fiscal 2024. The Company remains committed to returning cash to its shareholders while continuing to invest in the business to support the near- and long-term growth of TJX.Pension Payout OfferThe Company will be offering eligible, former TJX Associates who have not yet commenced their pension benefit an opportunity to receive a voluntary lump sum payout of their vested pension plan benefit. As a result, the Company anticipates a non-cash settlement charge, which may negatively impact Fiscal 2024 earnings per share by approximately $.01 to $.02. Any actual settlement charge may be higher or lower depending on participation rates and other factors. This potential non-cash settlement charge is expected to be incurred in the third quarter of Fiscal 2024 and would impact the Company’s pretax profit margin and earnings per share results. The potential impact of this pension payout offer is not included in the Company’s Fiscal 2024 outlook below. The Company expects to exclude the impact of this potential charge from the Company’s Fiscal 2024 adjusted pretax profit margin and adjusted earnings per share results.Second Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2024 OutlookFor the second quarter of Fiscal 2024, the Company is planning overall comparable store sales to be up 2% to 3%. For the second quarter of Fiscal 2024, the Company expects pretax profit margin to be in the range of 9.3% to 9.5% and diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $.72 to $.75.For the fiscal year ending February 3, 2024, the Company continues to plan overall comparable store sales to be up 2% to 3%. For the 53-week fiscal year ending February 3, 2024, the Company is increasing its expectations for pretax profit margin to a range of 10.3% to 10.5% and diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.49 to $3.58. The Company’s full-year guidance includes an expected pretax margin benefit of approximately 0.1 percentage point and a diluted earnings per share benefit of approximately $.10 due to the 53rd week in the Company’s Fiscal 2024 calendar. Excluding these expected benefits, the Company now expects full-year Fiscal 2024 adjusted pretax profit margin to be in the range of 10.2% to 10.4% and adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.39 to $3.48.Stores by ConceptDuring the first quarter ended April 29, 2023, the Company increased its store count by 30 stores to a total of 4,865 stores and increased square footage by 0.5% versus the prior quarter.Store Locations1Gross Square Feet2First Quarter FY2024First Quarter FY2024(in millions)BeginningEndBeginningEndIn the U.S.:T.J.

However, while stores in the U.S. were open for all of Fiscal 2022, a significant number of stores in TJX Canada and TJX International (Europe and Australia) experienced COVID-related temporary store closures and government-mandated shopping restrictions during Fiscal 2022. Therefore, in Fiscal 2023, the Company could not measure year-over-year comparable store sales with Fiscal 2022 in these geographies in a meaningful way. As a result, the comparable stores included in the Fiscal 2023 measure consisted of U.S. stores only, which, for clarity, the Company referred to as U.S. comparable store sales and are calculated against sales for the comparable periods in Fiscal 2022. For Fiscal 2022, due to the temporary closing of stores as a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic, the Company reported open-only comparable store sales. This measure reported the sales increase or decrease of stores initially classified as comp stores at the beginning of Fiscal 2021 for the days they were open in Fiscal 2022 against sales of those stores for the same days in Fiscal 2020.About The TJX Companies, Inc.The TJX Companies, Inc. is the leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions in the U.S. and worldwide. As of April 29, 2023, the end of the Company’s first quarter, the Company operated a total of 4,865 stores in nine countries, the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, Poland, Austria, the Netherlands, and Australia, and five e-commerce sites. These include 1,304 T.J. Maxx, 1,189 Marshalls, 901 HomeGoods, 81 Sierra, and 49 Homesense stores, as well as tjmaxx.com, marshalls.com, homegoods.com, and sierra.com, in the United States; 298 Winners, 152 HomeSense, and 106 Marshalls stores in Canada; 632 T.K. Maxx and 78 Homesense stores, as well as tkmaxx.com, in Europe; and 75 T.K. Maxx stores in Australia.

Non-GAAP financial measures refer to financial information adjusted to exclude or include, as applicable, from financial measures prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), items identified in this press release. Non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release include sales growth on a constant currency basis, inventory on a constant currency basis, adjusted pretax profit margin, and adjusted diluted earnings per share. The Company believes that the presentation of adjusted financial measures is useful to investors as it provides additional information on comparisons between periods by excluding certain items that affect overall comparability. The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for business planning purposes, to consider underlying trends of its business, and in measuring its performance relative to others in the market, and believes presenting these measures also provides information to investors and others for understanding and evaluating trends in the Company’s operating results or measuring performance in the same manner as the Company’s management. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The use of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similar measures reported by other companies and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures.Important Information at WebsiteArchived versions of the Company’s conference calls are available in the Investors section of TJX.com after they are no longer available by telephone, as are reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures and other financial information.

In February 2023, the Company announced that the Board of Directors had approved a new stock repurchase program that authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $2.0 billion of TJX common stock from time to time. Under this program and a previously announced program, TJX had approximately $3.0 billion available for repurchase as of April 29, 2023. TJX records the repurchase of its stock on a cash basis, and the amounts reflected in the financial statements may vary from the above amounts due to the timing of settlement of repurchases.During Fiscal 2023, the Company announced and completed the divestiture of its minority investment in Familia. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $218 million in the first quarter of Fiscal 2023 representing the entire carrying value of the investment. This charge had a $0.19 negative impact on diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of Fiscal 2023. Subsequently, the Company realized a $54 million tax benefit when the Company completed the divestiture of this investment during the third quarter of Fiscal 2023. Together, these resulted in a net $0.14 negative impact on diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2023.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230516005996/en/ContactsThe TJX Companies, Inc.Debra McConnellGlobal Communications(508) 390-2323]"

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX).

But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$138m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.2% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.Does TJX Companies Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?One positive for TJX Companies is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. To add an extra spark to the fire, significant insider ownership in the company is another highlight.

Perhaps another day’s worth of possible default on the national debt, or a recognition that the Fed really isn’t looking toward any interest rate moves lower at all this year, or that recession possibilities aren’t going anywhere. Regardless, the Dow dropped -332 points, -1.00%, the S&amp;P 500 was -0.64%, the Nasdaq outperformed the field, -0.18%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 again rode the caboose, -1.31% on the day.For the Dow, it’s the sixth lower trading day in the last seven, the 10th of the past 12. It also closed at session lows, as did the S&amp;P and Nasdaq. Energy was the worst trading sector, -12%, followed by Autos -10% and Banks -7%. Homebuilding had a decent day following a surprisingly strong Homebuilder Confidence Survey: a headline of 50 improved on the 45 expected and last month’s figure; it’s also the highest print and first “5-handle” since July of 2022. This offers further proof that the housing market continues to show signs of improvement.Business Inventories for March also came out earlier today, at -0.01% lower than the 0.0% expected and posted a month ago. This shows that the overall supply glut we saw back in late 2021, early 2022 are now a thing of the past. That said, we haven’t seen a positive read on this metric thus far in 2023. Inventories were reportedly higher at retailers (+0.7%) than manufacturers (-0.8%).Tomorrow we get new Housing Starts and Building Permits numbers for April. Starts are expected to come down a touch while Permits — often seen as a proxy for future starts — are predicted to rise a tad. We’re currently off January lows on starts, as mortgage rates have eased somewhat since zooming past +7%; but at 1.40 million forecast, we’re also well off the 1.805 million posted a year ago at this time. Permits have posted figures that are a bit more volatile of late, but mostly follow similar trends: cycle lows over the winter, recent highs a year in the rearview mirror.We’ll also see Q1 earnings results from Target TGT and TJX Companies TJX Wednesday, as retailers continue their parade of reports this week and next. Target goes into its earnings release with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and a Value-Growth-Momentum grade of A. TJX also carries a Value-Growth-Momentum grade of A, but currently also has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Both companies look to improve on revenues year over year, where only TJX is also expected to post positive growth on earnings.Questions or comments about this article and/or its author?

(NYSE:HD) shares declined as the retailer slashed its outlook and expectations for annual sales. The stock pared earlier losses but remained in negative territory. The home improvement retailer forecasts sales to decline by a staggering 2% to 5% in fiscal 2023 as demand eases for renovation projects and accompanying goods.Ahead of a week chock full of earnings reports from retailers, Home Depot posted a revenue miss which points to weak demand and comparable sales that also missed estimates. Among the factors cited were inclement weather in California in the latest quarter, alongside lumber deflation, and “broad-based pressure across the business” compared to Q4 2022 – according to Home Depot CEO and President, Ted Decker.Retailer companies reporting quarterly earnings this week, include Target Corp.

We are seeing the Dow Jones Industrial Average as well as the S&amp;P lower and the NASDAQ trading on both sides of flat this morning.And, of course, Home Depot's shares are in the spotlight today following its latest earnings report, and shares do remain in negative territory. Earlier, the retail slashed its outlook and also said that it expects annual sales for the home-improvement retailer to fall as consumers cut spending and as demand for home renovations and home-improvement goods pull back.Meanwhile, taking a closer look at the details out from the earnings report, Home Depot does expect sales to decline by 2% to 5% in fiscal 2023, and that is a considerable pullback considering that earlier this year the retailer said that it expect to see flat sales.Story continuesMeanwhile, first-quarter revenue missed analysts' forecasts as well with revenue down by 4.2% at $37.26 billion. This is the biggest revenue miss since November 2002.At the same time, comp sales fell by 4 and 1/2% for the retailer, much more than expected. At the same time, Q1 profit did come in above estimates at $3.87 billion.And this week we will be getting more earnings out from the retail sector.

BioMarin Pharmaceuticals Inc, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sarepta Therapeutics, which are all worth more than $10 billion, saw their shares drop between 3% and 7%.Spokespeople for all of the companies either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment. FTC officials did not respond to a request for comment on whether they planned to challenge any other pharmaceutical acquisitions.""The FTC filing a lawsuit to block (the Amgen) deal will dampen M&amp;A enthusiasm across the biotech sector, particularly given the lack of direct portfolio overlap between Amgen and Horizon,"" William Blair analysts wrote in a note.FOCUS ON 'BUNDLING'Story continuesThe FTC said it opposed the deal because it was concerned that Amgen could use rebates to pharmacy benefit managers - middlemen who oversee drug benefits for employers and insurers - in exchange for promoting Horizon's two key products, to the detriment of rivals seeking to compete on price.The products are fast-growing thyroid eye disease treatment Tepezza and gout drug Krystexxa.Seeking to thwart a deal based on the potential for this ""bundling"" practice is a novel approach that regulators had not previously deployed in antitrust cases, analysts and legal experts said.Amgen has said that neither it nor Horizon plan to bundle, and the experts said this line of attack stood a strong chance of being shot down in court.""I don't think (the FTC lawsuit) changes anything long term,"" said one of several Jefferies analysts on a conference call the brokerage hosted for clients on Tuesday to discuss the implications of the regulators' move.Nonetheless, the prospect of other deals facing regulatory challenges spooked investors. Their focus is on Seagen, a major cancer drug developer, whose acquirer, Pfizer, already has some overlap in its product portfolio and pipeline.While Pfizer does not possess the drugs that Seagen specializes in, which combine synthetic antibodies with potent chemicals, the drug giant has a robust portfolio of more than 20 approved cancer medications.""We could see similar challenges to the Pfizer/Seagen deal"" BMO analysts wrote in a note, arguing that the FTC could target other major drug companies with the resources to engage in bundling.UNDER THE RADARConversely, investors and analysts are hoping that smaller pharmaceutical acquisitions will continue to fly under the radar of regulators. This is why the shares of such companies that have pending deals dropped much less on Tuesday.Of the 11 acquisitions of publicly listed biotech companies announced since the start of the year, only Pfizer's acquisition of Seagen was worth well in excess of $10 billion.""Thawing of interest in mega-deals would invariably shift consolidation focus to smaller and earlier-stage biotech companies – and more of them,"" Evercore analysts said in a note.(Reporting by David Carnevali in New York; Editing by Greg Roumeliotis and Jamie Freed)]"

Expectations of a slowdown in Federal Reserve rate hikes led to this gain in gold. Risk-off trade sentiments emanating from the banking crisis also favored a gold rally this year.As a result, the first-quarter 2023 earnings of gold mining companies have become pivotal this season. Let's delve deeper to uncover the earnings and outlook for gold mining stocks as well as analyze its impact on ETFs.Earnings in FocusNewmont's (NEM) Q1 Earnings Top, Revenues Lag EstimatesIn late April, Newmont reported earnings from continuing operations of 42 cents per share in first-quarter 2023 compared with earnings of 54 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. Barring one-time items, adjusted earnings were 40 cents per share, down from 69 cents reported in the prior-year quarter but ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 33 cents.The company’s revenues for the first quarter were $2,679 million, down around 11% year over year. The figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,861.3 million. Newmont's attributable gold production in the first quarter was 1.27 million ounces, down 5% from 1.34 million ounces a year ago. Production was hurt by lower mill recovery.Newmont said that it is on track to achieve attributable gold production guidance of 5.7-6.3 million ounces. The company also expects gold CAS between $870 and $970 per ounce, and AISC within $1,150-$1,250 per ounce.Barrick Gold's (GOLD) Q1 Earnings Top Estimates, Revenues LagIn early May, Barrick Gold reported a first-quarter 2023 net income of $120 million or 7 cents per share, down from $438 million or 25 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. Barring one-time items, adjusted earnings were 14 cents per share. The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 11 cents.Barrick recorded sales of $2,643 million, down around 7.4% year over year. The figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,207.6 million. The results in the reported quarter were hurt by lower year-over-year gold and copper production, a fall in gold sales volumes and higher costs. For 2023, Barrick anticipates attributable gold production in the range of 4.2-4.6 million ounces.Story continuesAgnico Eagle (AEM) Q1 Earnings &amp; Revenues Surpass EstimatesIn early May, Agnico Eagle Mines reported a first-quarter 2023 net income of $1,816.9 million or $3.86 per share, surging from $119.1 million or 31 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. Barring one-time items, adjusted earnings were 57 cents per share. The bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 50 cents.The company generated revenues of $1,509.7 million, up around 13.9% year over year. It surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,300.3 million. Payable gold production was 812,813 ounces in the reported quarter, up from 660,604 ounces in the prior-year quarter. The company continues to expect payable gold production for 2023 in the range of 3.24-3.44 million ounces.Wheaton (WPM) Q1 Earnings Match Estimates, Sales MissIn early May,Wheaton Precious Metals reported adjusted earnings per share of 23 cents in first-quarter 2023, which came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The bottom line declined 34% year over year. The company generated revenues of $214 million in the reported quarter, down 30% on a year-over-year basis. The downside was caused by a 14.3% decrease in Gold Equivalent Ounces (GEOs) sold. The top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $228 million.Wheaton’s gold production was 73,037 ounces, down from the prior-year quarter’s figure of 78,054 ounces. Attributable silver production slumped 21% year over year to 4,927 ounces and palladium production declined 17% to 3,705 ounces.ETF in Focus Production worries remained prevalent in the earnings results. This was because gold prices were under pressure last year. However, scenario could improve gradually given favorable operating backdrop for gold miners. VanEck Gold Miners ETF GDX is up 17.7% this year but has lost 4.2% following downbeat-to-neutral earnings results. The afore-mentioned four companies take about 30% of the fund GDX.Newmont also have about 15% focus on iShares MSCI Global Gold Miners ETF RING and 8.5% focus on Sprott Gold Miners ETF SGDM. Barrick Gold and Agnico Eagle have about 11% and 10% exposure to SGDM, respectively.

Under the SID, it will acquire 100% of the issued share capital in Newcrest under an Australian court-approved Scheme of Arrangement.Newcrest shareholders will get 0.400 Newmont shares for each Newcrest share, as well as a special dividend of up to $1.10 per share paid by Newcrest, representing a 30.4% premium. The payment of the special dividend is conditional on the scheme becoming effective. The deal, which gives Newcrest an implied enterprise value of A$28.8 billion (roughly $19.2 billion), is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2023. Shareholders of Newmont and Newcrest will own roughly 69% and 31% of the combined entity, respectively, following the scheme's implementation.The union of Newmont and Newcrest delivers an extraordinary value proposition for shareholders and other stakeholders, NEM noted. It establishes an industry-leading portfolio with a multi-decade gold and copper production profile in the most favorable mining jurisdictions in the world. The acquisition boosts Newmont's annual copper output - a critical commodity for the new energy economy - and adds almost 50 billion pounds of copper reserves and resources from Newcrest to its strong and well-balanced portfolio.This acquisition is expected to result in a world-class portfolio of assets, primarily in favorable, low-risk mining jurisdictions, with the largest concentration of Tier 1 operations. With this portfolio, Newmont will be well-placed to create strong, consistent and long-term returns while achieving best-in-class sustainability performance in the future. The portfolio is expected to deliver around 8 million ounces of combined annual gold production upon the transaction closure and combined annual copper production of approximately 350 million pounds from Australia and Canada.Newmont has identified the potential for significant synergies, with $500 million in total annual pre-tax benefits expected within the first 24 months of the transaction's completion. Pre-tax general and administrative synergies of around $100 million, generated by Newmont's scalable, integrated operating model with existing regional teams in Australia and Canada, will likely be achieved.Supply chain synergies of roughly $200 million are also expected from best-in-class pricing and existing strong partnerships with key suppliers, smelters and equipment manufacturers due to exceptional economies of scale. At least $200 million of benefits are also anticipated from Newmont's proven “Full Potential” continuous improvement program, which reduces costs and increases productivity by rapidly replicating leading processes and advanced technology.Story continuesPrice PerformanceNEM’s shares are down 28.1% over a year, underperforming the industry’s decline of 11.8%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNewmont, on its first-quarter call said that it is on track to meet its attributable gold production projection of 5.7-6.3 million ounces for 2023.

This move lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.64%. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 1.01%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 4.13%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the department store operator had lost 14.38% over the past month. This has lagged the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 2.38% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 0.13% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Macy's as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be June 1, 2023. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.46, down 57.41% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $5.12 billion, down 4.26% from the year-ago period.M's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $3.73 per share and revenue of $23.93 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -16.74% and -2.09%, respectively.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Macy's. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 1.58% lower within the past month. Macy's currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Investors should also note Macy's's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 4.1. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 8.4, so we one might conclude that Macy's is trading at a discount comparatively.Story continuesWe can also see that M currently has a PEG ratio of 0.34. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate.

119,1c41a27c-dbce-39f3-99ab-5c356f784fb0,M,2023-05-17,Why Macy's (M) Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-macys-m-could-beat-161004863.html,1684253404,STORY,['M'],"[Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering Macy's (M), which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Regional Department Stores industry.This department store operator has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 96.71%.For the most recent quarter, Macy's was expected to post earnings of $1.57 per share, but it reported $1.88 per share instead, representing a surprise of 19.75%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.19 per share, while it actually produced $0.52 per share, a surprise of 173.68%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor Macy's, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Macy's currently has an Earnings ESP of +2.81%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on June 1, 2023.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Macy's (M) earns a Zacks Rank #3 16 days from its next quarterly earnings release on June 1, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.47 a share.M has an Earnings ESP figure of 2.81%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.47 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.46.M is one of just a large database of Retail-Wholesale stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY).O'Reilly Automotive is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on July 26, 2023. ORLY's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $9.98 a share 71 days from its next earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for O'Reilly Automotive is $9.96, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 0.27%.Story continuesM and ORLY's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

The award has been offered by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Detroit Arsenal, MI.Valued at $17.6 million, this contract is expected to be completed by May 24, 2024. The work related to this deal will be executed in Sterling Heights, MI.The contract involves foreign military sales to Kuwait and Poland.Significance of the Abrams TankThe M1A2 SEPv3 Abrams is the most advanced main battle tank. It boasts features that are technologically advanced in terms of communications, fire control and lethality, reliability, sustainment and fuel efficiency, along with an upgraded armor. The SEPv3 Abrams is also designed to seamlessly accept future upgrades.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?Military tanks are the primary offensive weapons in the land mission of the military. An efficient armored military tank enables the army to carry out any mission by direct fire. Moreover, the recent tiff between Ukraine and Russia has accelerated the pace of upgrading the defense landscape with technologically advanced arms and ammunition, which, in turn, has led to increased investments in military tanks.In this context, it is imperative to mention that the increased focus on technologically advanced combat vehicles is likely to benefit General Dynamics as its Land System business unit is a prime contractor of land combat vehicles for the U.S. Navy. It provides innovative design, engineering, technology, production and full life-cycle support for land combat vehicles worldwide.Its excellence and in-depth experience in building combat vehicles, coupled with a customer-first focus and a seasoned supply-chain network, has been leveraging the company to win multiple contracts from the U.S. Army and its allies. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.Such an upward trend in demand is likely to bolster GD’s revenue generation prospects from its Land System business unit and boost the company’s overall top line.Story continuesGrowth ProspectsThe changing dynamics of the military landscape and the rising geopolitical tension have made it mandatory for a country to continuously evolve and strengthen its defense structure. To this end, military tanks form an integral part of any combat mission and land warfare affair.Per a report from Markets and Markets, the global armored vehicle market is projected to witness a CAGR of 3.1% during the 2022-2027 period. Such abounding growth trends indicate ample growth opportunities for General Dynamics as it enjoys a lucrative position in the armored vehicle market.A few defense primes that can reap the multitude of gains from the expanding armored vehicle market are BAE Systems BAESY, Northrop Grumman NOC and Raytheon Technologies RTX.BAE System’s Challenger 2 is a heavily armored and highly mobile battle tank, designed for use in the direct fire zone. Its primary role is to destroy or neutralize the armor. It also has the ability to engage both hard and soft targets and can operate across a spectrum of high-intensity conflicts, counter insurgencies and peacekeeping roles.BAESY’s long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 13.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2023 sales indicates an improvement of 25.4% from that reported in the previous year.Northrop Grumman is the world’s top producer of medium-caliber live and training ammunition and gun systems, with more than 5 million units built in the last five years. It specializes in innovating low-cost, highly reliable precise weapons and ammunition for artillery and mortar systems, medium-caliber weapon platforms, battle tanks and individual soldiers.NOC has a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2023 sales indicates an improvement of 4.7% from the year-ago reported figure.Raytheon is currently teaming up with American Rheinmetall Vehicles to meet the U.S. Army’s current requirement for a true, next-generation Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle, namely the Lynx Infantry Fighting Vehicle. The Lynx Infantry Fighting Vehicle is a next-generation, tracked, armored fighting vehicle designed to address the critical challenges of the future battlefield.RTX’s long-term earnings growth rate is currently pegged at 8.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2023 sales indicates an improvement of 8.3% from that reported in 2022.Price PerformanceShares of General Dynamics have lost 9.2% in the past year compared to the industry’s decline of 5.3%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankGeneral Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

However, commodity cost inflation is expected to weigh on gross margins. Supply-chain disruptions and tough labor market will play spoilsports.Unfavorable foreign currency translations and high R&amp;D expenses are also likely to limit profits.

That was up from the $29.9 million loss a year ago. Readers might be interested to understand what that looks like in terms of raw production. In the first quarter, the company manufactured 655 3-blade sets compared to 547 a year earlier. That required 37 dedicated manufacturing lines. That equates to 17 blade sets per factory over a quarter. That’s roughly a single blade set per factory every 5 days. That’s almost 3,000 megawatts of energy production which could power at least 1.2 million homes for a year. Story continuesOcean Power Technologies (OPTT) A photograph of the ocean.Source: Manu Galdamez/ShutterStock.comOcean Power Technologies (NYSEAMERICAN:OPTT) is a stock related to tidal power or the power harnessed from the kinetic energy in waves. It sells buoys that are designed to capture and store that energy under its PowerBuoy brand. The PowerBuoy platform also serves to provide real-time data communications for remote maritime and subsea applications. It is one of the very few publicly-traded firms engaged in tidal energy production. Fortunately, it’s also performing pretty well. Revenues increased by 51% in the first quarter, reaching $734,000. Sales increased by 75% in the 9 months that ended Jan. 31, totaling $1.752 million. Still, OPTT stock may be one to avoid for the simple fact that losses far exceed revenues. The PowerBuoy system is an uninterruptible power supply that harvests wave energy thereby recharging itself constantly. It is moored at the point of use and works in water between 20 meters to 3 km. Ocean Power Technologies sells into multiple industries including defense, energy, offshore wind, and research. NextEra Energy (NEE) Person holding the glowing world in their hands with icons with different types of energy. Energy stocks; energy storageSource: PopTika / ShutterstockNextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is leading the way in renewable energy innovation in ways that are slightly different from the firms listed above. NEE stock offers a unique blend of attributes that make it a powerful investment. That is the innovation we’ll be discussing. What I mean is simple. NextEra Energy comprises Florida Power &amp; Light and NextEra Energy Resources. FPL is the largest utility firm in the U.S. while NEER is the largest generator of energy from solar and wind sources. That unique blend of scale across both of its business lines and diversity makes NEE stock something of an innovator. It’s simultaneously a steady, reliable firm due to its utility business while also rife with growth potential due to its renewables business. The shares also include a dividend that hasn’t been reduced since 1995 which is a common feature among utilities stocks. It is innovative in both the scale of its renewable operations and the uniqueness it offers as an investment. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Now, this is something he had sort of talked about that he was doing here. And my caveat or my disclaimer, whenever we talk about 13F filings, they are a snapshot of one day.Now, Warren Buffett, as we know, tends to buy and hold stakes. But we also don't know what's on the other side of the equation. Is he shorting? Is he hedging? Are there things he is not disclosing?So it doesn't give a sense literally a full picture of what's going on. But it does give us a little bit of an insight into what he is doing.- Yeah. Even our discussions ahead of the show, it was pointed out by our team that yeah, this is also one of the largest lenders on the financial basis for auto purchases. Auto purchases here, especially for Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, they have already taken another stake last year. They took a stake in Ally Financial, and that one of the other large player in autos. So within that kind of lending capacity, it'd be interesting to see where they perhaps are looking across the automotive landscape and where, for some of the loans that both Capital One and Ally Financial, where that is appetizing for them to add on to their portfolio right now.- Yeah. I want to bring Katy Kaminsky back into this discussion because I think the regional bank discussion is still so interesting. Is that an area where you're looking at either banks broadly, regional bank specifically? Because it feels like there are a lot of headwinds still to come in this group.Story continuesKATY KAMINSKI: Yes. I mean, I think this comes back-- what I love that you're talking about Buffett here right now is he's a value investor. So they're looking at companies where they see value over the long term. And we got to remember, they were very successful back in 2008 in sifting through the rummage in a very extreme financial environment.But what's interesting now is, really, the fixed income angle of this. And which of these banks are the best positioned to deal with a very different rate environment, either inverted curve or, as we see yields might be moving, and we see capital rolling over and people trying to refinance it, I think that's where the interesting opportunities come in the space, is figuring out which banks are going to be better positioned to move as capital costs have changed significantly going through this tightening cycle that we've been through right now. And we've already seen that there's trouble in the waters with what happened earlier this year. And so the question is going to be which other banks are better positioned to move with the situation and which of them are going to have more challenges because, perhaps, they're in an area, like you said, autos, that is better, or another area, which is going to have more challenges.- Yeah, absolutely. Katy, we have to-- we've got to shift gears here a little bit just after the Opening Bell. Katy Kaminski joining us this morning for all things discussion, wide ranging, I might add, debt ceiling all the way into Fed policy. Katy Kaminski of AlphaSimplex. Thanks so much, Katy.]"

132,6160a1e9-46f5-3da6-9e51-8987175d0453,QCOM,2023-05-17,Those who invested in QUALCOMM (NASDAQ:QCOM) five years ago are up 108%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/those-invested-qualcomm-nasdaq-qcom-110047324.html,1684321247,STORY,['QCOM'],"[It hasn't been the best quarter for QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) shareholders, since the share price has fallen 22% in that time. On the bright side the returns have been quite good over the last half decade. It has returned a market beating 81% in that time.Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. Check out our latest analysis for QUALCOMM To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During the last half decade, QUALCOMM became profitable. That would generally be considered a positive, so we'd expect the share price to be up. Since the company was unprofitable five years ago, but not three years ago, it's worth taking a look at the returns in the last three years, too. Indeed, the QUALCOMM share price has gained 33% in three years. Meanwhile, EPS is up 40% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 10% average annual increase in the share price over the same three years. Therefore, it seems the market has moderated its expectations for growth, somewhat. This unenthusiastic sentiment is reflected in the stock's reasonably modest P/E ratio of 10.88.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of QUALCOMM's earnings, revenue and cash flow.Story continuesWhat About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of QUALCOMM, it has a TSR of 108% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 0.8% in the last year, QUALCOMM shareholders lost 24% (even including dividends). However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 16%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

After all, tech stocks are generally associated with capital gains through share price appreciation, not dividends, since many tech stocks do not pay dividends.However, this has begun to change. The technology sector contains many reliable, high-yield dividend stocks. This article will discuss three blue-chip tech stocks with solid dividend yields and high dividend growth potential.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsQualcomm (QCOM)Qualcomm (QCOM) sign near Qualcomm Research Silicon Valley office of San Diego based chip and semiconductor companySource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a semiconductor manufacturer that develops and sells integrated circuits for use in voice and data communications. The chip maker receives royalty payments for its patents used in devices that are on 3G, 4G and 5G networks. Qualcomm has a current market capitalization of $149 billion and has annual sales of about $38 billion.On May 3, the company reported second-quarter financial results. Revenue of $9.27 billion fell 17% year-over-year as the company faced difficult comparisons to a very successful 2022, as well as the impact of a slowing global economy. Adjusted earnings per share of $2.15 missed estimates by 1 cent. Total QCT revenue and Handsets revenue fell 17%, partially offset by a 20% increase in revenue from its automotive segment. Qualcomm expects quarterly revenue between $8.1 billion and $8.9 billion for the current quarter.The company has grown EPS at a rate of 6.6% per year over the last decade. An agreement with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Huawei, a lower share count, and leadership in 5G should allow the company to grow in the coming years.The components that Qualcomm produces are considered to be the best available, so phone makers will likely continue using the company’s products in future iterations of their devices. This is especially true as 5G launches continue to occur.Qualcomm has increased its dividend for 21 consecutive years. With a dividend payout ratio under 40%, the dividend appears highly secure. Shares currently yield 2.9%.Story continuesInternational Business Machines (IBM)Sign of IBM on the office buildingSource: Laborant / Shutterstock.comInternational Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) is a global information technology company that provides integrated enterprise solutions for software, hardware and services. IBM’s focus is running mission-critical systems for large, multi-national customers and governments. IBM typically provides end-to-end solutions. After the spinoff of Kyndryl, its managed infrastructure business, the company now has four business segments: Software, Consulting, Infrastructure and Financing. IBM had annual revenue of about $60.5 billion in 2022.IBM reported results for Q1 2023 on April 19. Companywide revenue grew 0.4% to $14.25 million from $14.19 million. Diluted adjusted EPS fell 3% to $1.36 from $1.40 on a year-over-year basis. Diluted GAAP EPS increased to $1.02 in the quarter from 73 cents in the prior year on lower expenses and higher margins on better pricing.Also, IBM’s revenue and earnings are being impacted by the strong U.S. dollar causing a 4% headwind. Revenue for Software increased 2.6% to $5.92 million from $5.77 million in comparable quarters due to 2% growth in Hybrid Platform &amp; Solutions and a 3% increase in Transaction Processing. Revenue was up 8% for RedHat, down 1% for Automation, up 1% for Data &amp; AI, and down 1% for Security. Consulting revenue increased 2.8% to $4.96 million from $4.82 million due to a 1% rise in Business Transformation, a 1% decline in Technology Consulting, and 7% growth in Application Operations.IBM’s competitive strength is its brand, entrenched customer relations and extensive patent portfolio. IBM is also the market leader in mainframe computers, where it has 90% of the market and little competition. IBM is a different company after the Kyndryl spinoff, but it should still be recession resistant. The nature of mission-critical IT enterprise systems and software makes this unlikely to change in the near future.IBM has increased its dividend for over 25 years, making it a Dividend Aristocrat. Shares currently yield 5.4%.Oracle Corporation (ORCL)The Oracle (ORCL) sign hangs on an Oracle office in Deerfield, Illinois.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comOracle (NYSE:ORCL) is an information technology company that provides software, hardware and services. Its offerings include applications, platforms, infrastructure technologies (cloud software), hardware products such as servers, hardware-related software products (e.g., operating systems) and services such as consultation and education.Oracle reported its most recent quarterly results, for its fiscal third quarter, on March 9. The company announced that it generated revenues of $12.4 billion during the quarter, which represents an increase of 18% YOY. Growth was positively impacted by mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A), which is why Oracle grew faster than the average over the last couple of years. Oracle generated EPS of $1.22 during the third quarter, which was up 8% versus the prior year’s quarter and beat the consensus estimate slightly.For the current fiscal year, Oracle is forecasting that it will grow its revenues meaningfully, while EPS should be up slightly this year. Oracle is not operating a cloud business as large as some of its peers, but it still is generating attractive growth in the markets it addresses. Infrastructure-as-a-Service, as well as Platform-as-a-Service, are markets that are growing at a fast pace. They should allow Oracle to maintain an attractive cloud computing growth rate going forward.Oracle’s dividend payout ratio was extremely low a decade ago, but since then the payout ratio has risen relatively consistently. At a payout ratio of less than 30%, the dividend is very manageable, and there is still a lot of room for further dividend increases. Due to the low payout ratio and the fact that the company was not impacted to a large degree during the last financial crisis, Oracle’s dividend is rated very safe. The stock currently yields 1.7%.On the date of publication, Bob Ciura did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Source: Expedia GroupExpedia Group told Google that the bait and switch tactics that some online travel agencies deploy in Google’s price comparison feature, Google Hotels, is “screwed up” and Google made some satisfactory changes.That’s according to Expedia Group CEO Peter Kern, who discussed the issue with Skift last week, and mentioned it at the company’s partner conference in Seattle, as well.Expedia spends billions of dollars every year advertising its listings on Google.com, travel.google.com, and Google-owned Youtube, all of which are important travel advertising vehicles.“We went to them (Google) as a big customer, and said, ‘Your marketplace is screwed up, and we spend a lot of money in it. And if you want us to keep spending a lot of money in it, you’ve got to make it fair. You don’t need to advantage us. Just take out people that are misleading customers, and we’re good with that. We’re not asking for special treatment.'”Kern said Google used its own tech to make improvements, and they did a fairly good job.Google doesn’t see any alleged discussions between the two companies in the same way that Kern did.A Google spokesperson said it wouldn’t be accurate to say that discussions with one individual customer spurred price accuracy improvements.“We have always worked hard to ensure that people can see accurate prices when they look for hotels on Google,” the company said in a statement. “Over the years, we’ve incorporated user feedback to continuously improve the systems that make this possible.”Best Hotels Lists a Lower Rate, MisleadinglyEven this week, the issue persisted.For example, on its initial listing in Google’s price comparison feature, Google Hotels, Expedia on Sunday listed a superior room at the Eurostars Grand Marina in Barcelona for a May 30-31 stay for $216. When you click through to book it the total price would be $232 if you prepay for the room, and $245 if you pay at the property.However, Best Hotels on Sunday listed the same property and bed type for a May 30-31 stay on Google at a lower price than Expedia did, $183 for Best Hotels versus $216 for Expedia. Despite Best Hotels’ enticing $183 rate, it turned out that Best Hotels’ total price for that room was actually higher than Expedia’s. The Best Hotels rate was $236 if you prepay versus $232 for Expedia, and $251 if you pay at the hotel versus $245 with Expedia.Story continuesSo Google allowed Best Hotels to lure travelers with a lower rate than Expedia offered for the Eurostars Grand Marina although Expedia was the one to actually offer lower total rates.Expedia Took Its Concerns to GoogleThese sorts of misleading pricing practices take place all too often on Google, and on other price comparison, or metasearch sites, as well. Skift didn’t have to look a long time to find such an example; it surfaced in the second listing we examined.“So we went to them (Google) and basically said, ‘Look, your stated position is your search is designed to improve the customer experience. But you are allowing all these bait and switch players (to be on Google). And when you click through, the customer actually gets a worse outcome,” Kern said.Kern wasn’t commenting on the Best Hotels example, which Skift found this week. He was talking about the issue in general terms.“Consumers get lost in that bait and switch,” Kern said. “That’s why it’s worked for a thousand years.”Kern said Expedia told Google “‘you should clean that up.’ And I think they agreed with us. They went about creating some technological fixes. I think they did a reasonably good job in making it better, although not perfect.”Google claimed it always aims for the best user experience for people trying to obtain travel information, and that Google acts on feedback from both partners and travelers.Here’s Google’s price accuracy policy. Among those policies, Google levies suspensions for travel companies that engage in deceptive practices.Expedia has its own technology, which several large hotel chains are using, to ensure that online travel agencies and others aren’t offering hotel rates, such as wholesale prices for a stay, that they aren’t authorized to sell.  Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"
135,d26b34a0-263a-34c1-a321-ba8ee727de33,PHM,2023-05-17,Bull of the Day: PulteGroup (PHM),Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bull-day-pultegroup-phm-092009548.html,1684315209,STORY,['PHM'],"[Just when investors thought the housing market would implode under the ""squared weight"" of (1) a steeply inverted yield curve and (2) the regional banking crisis, we are witness to homebuilders like PulteGroup (PHM) putting up solid Q1 numbers and guidance that lift their prospects considerably.The reason that PHM is a Zacks #1 Rank now is that analysts launched their consensus estimates since that report from full-year EPS of $7.44 to $9.05.And next year's profit haul also moved higher from $7.24 to $9.00 per share.This rebound may mark the earnings trough not only for many homebuilders, but for real estate in general.Inflation and Interest Rates: Have They Peaked?This past weekend I published an article about the ""possible peak"" in my real estate-focused newsletter Multifamily Investing.You can read the full version at the link but here is a synopsis...The US economy is doing a pretty good job of absorbing the regional banking crisis.Despite the persistence of digital banks runs -- with short-sellers preying on blood in the water to drive out deposits by pummeling stock prices -- the stock market has held up well and the Federal Reserve signaled a pause in their efforts to battle inflation.Meanwhile, job creation, consumer spending, and housing markets remain strong according to a collection of robust data sets.This scenario sets up “the pause” for the Fed with interest rate hikes.That diverse body of economists, with tons of data and analysis at their disposal, has done a good amount to tamp down wildfire inflation.And while the yield curve will remain inverted for some time, the message is clear that they have taken a big bite out of the cost surges.So now we are seeing inflation stabilize across many sectors. Sure, 5-7% inflation in some sectors like Food &amp; Energy are alarming.But what matters now to investors is the trend direction and speed.And that trend is showing a new downward trajectory in inflation and a slowing in the rate of acceleration in either direction.History shows that this pattern leads to the fire being put out.Especially in the age of exponential technologies that tend to foster hyper productivity and disinflation. Honestly, when was the last time you had to worry about sending a check, a document, a photo, or yourself for a signature when they can all be done now instantaneously?What's the Impact for Real Estate?While I thought the regional banking crisis would have a bigger negative impact on mortgage lending than the positives of the Fed pause, I’m starting to reconsider that idea.In their article for Forbes Advisor, Mortgage Rate Forecast For 2023, Robin Rothstein and Chris Jennings (Editor) suggest that the inflation battle is being won and the market is recognizing this...Recent data indicates the Fed's tightening policy seems to be working, though some analysts say too well, given the ongoing turmoil in the banking sector. Nevertheless, headline inflation cooled to 5% in March for the first time in nearly two years and is well below its June 2022 peak of 9.1%. Even so, the current rate is still far above the Fed's 2% goal.The good thing about this article is that they quote a variety of real estate-focused economists and analysts sharing their views of the unfolding interest rate landscape.On the alarmed end of the spectrum comes this...“The latest interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve is unnecessary and harmful,” said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, in an emailed statement. “(Small regional banks) are becoming zombie-like banks, unable to lend even to good businesses as they are more concerned with balance sheet shuffling for survival. This situation will worsen with each additional rate hike by the Federal Reserve.""Among the optimists were these forecasts...National Association of Realtors (NAR). “[F]orecasts that … mortgage rates will drop—with the 30-year fixed mortgage rate progressively falling to 6.0% this year and to 5.6% in 2024.”Compass U.S. region president, Neda Navab. “There have been signals that mortgage interest rates may be at or near their peak, given recent encouraging news around inflation and a corresponding drop in the U.S. Treasury yields that help set mortgage rates. A sustained drop could push mortgage rates into the 5% range late in the second quarter or in the second half of 2023, but that’s definitely not guaranteed.”Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA). “Long-term rates have already peaked. We expect that 30-year mortgage rates will end 2023 at 5.2%.”What About the Debt Ceiling Battle?We've seen this movie before and it usually gets resolved after some customary political brinkmanship.But the Forbes Advisor piece does share some additional views, including the idea that the uncertainty and potential for default will keep rates elevated into the summer.This remains the wild card for the spring home-buying season.The good news is that digital-centric financial markets are extremely quick at absorbing new information (good or bad) and discounting new trends.This means that barring a tumultuous US default event, inflation and rates are trending down, the regional bank crisis volatility is being absorbed by much bigger banks, and national lenders, builders, and investors will be modeling for rates in the 5% handle.And if the economy avoids recession, then all the bargains I was expecting in the Multifamily space may not unfold either. To learn more, check out this on-demand educational webinar from Mike Morawski where he goes over the return dynamics, underwriting traps, and tax advantages of Multifamily Investing…Creating Generational WealthMike has some great slides in there that illustrate what I call the ""power laws"" of Cash Flow and Equity Build.Bottom line: We could still get more Regional Bank scares, but the intelligence of the market discounting machine has weighed and measured what these failures mean and found them lacking in systemic or economic impact.

That's one takeaway from Home Depot's uninspired first-quarter results.""The size of the projects are getting a bit smaller,"" Home Depot (HD) CEO Ted Decker told analysts on the company's first quarter earnings call Monday.""It could be that the projects [are] being deferred or it could be that the project is being broken up into chunks,"" Decker said. ""Rather than do an entire room or an entire basement, you start working it in smaller chunks and that clearly impacts items per basket in overall activity.""On a yearly basis, customer transactions slid 4.8%, but came in better than Wall Street’s call for a 5.36% drop. Customers also spent less per ticket than anticipated, recording a 0.2% gain against expectations of a 2.63% boost in average ticket sizes.Big-ticket transactions, or those over $1,000, were down 6.5% compared with the first quarter of last year. Customers also shied away from flooring, kitchen, and bath during the quarter, another potential signal that they are downsizing projects.DIY customers also outperformed the professionals sector as demand shifted toward smaller projects, Home Depot said.That jibes with other research on remodeling.Aerial view of The Home Depot store and parking lot in San Diego, California, USA. Home Depot is the largest home improvement retailer and construction service in the US. (Thomas De Wever via Getty Images)John Burns Research and Consulting's remodeler index survey noted this home improvement softness in its April report. Just over half of remodelers surveyed said first quarter projects were smaller in scope because of less extensive work, while 20% said customers would rather tackle the project themselves than hire a professional.Similarly, home remodeling is expected to drop by early next year, according to the Leading Indicator of Remodeling Activity (LIRA) released in April by the Remodeling Futures Program at the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University.LIRA projected that year-over-year expenses for homeowner improvements and maintenance will result in a 2.8% drop through the first quarter of 2024.Story continues""Higher interest rates and sharp downturns in homebuilding and existing home sales are driving our projections for sluggish remodeling activity next year,"" Abbe Will, senior research associate and associate project director at the Remodeling Futures Program, wrote in a blog post last month. ""With ongoing uncertainty in financial markets and the threat of a recession, homeowners are increasingly likely to pare back or delay projects beyond necessary replacements and repairs.""(Photo: Getty Creative) (Vincent Ricardel via Getty Images)Home prices and higher mortgage rates may also play a role in where remodeling activity goes.""There's generally a lag effect to home price appreciation or depreciation,"" Decker said. ""I think the difference here is how sensitive are people going to be. [They were] up 45% in home value from the end of 2019, [and] now month over month, the values are off slightly, but still up 40% or 38% from where it was at the end of 2019.""And home prices have started to rise again on a monthly basis after contracting some this winter. Meanwhile, executives touched on the locked-in effect that many homeowners — who may have listed their homes under more favorable interest rate conditions — are feeling.""In this environment, if you have a low fixed rate mortgage, and let's just remind ourselves, 40% of owner-occupied homes are owned outright. And of the households that hold the mortgage, close to 90% of those hold fixed rate mortgages under 5%. So with mortgage rates where they are today, there's a reluctance to sell your home, and there is a greater incentive to stay in place and improve in place,"" Home Depot CFO Richard McPhail said on the call.""You're spending more time at home and that home is getting older and you do not have an incentive to sell and take on a higher rate mortgage,"" he said. ""So I think we've already seen that in housing turnover.""Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

138,5bd8abc9-4496-3ef6-9c87-f4fe2f7b4755,PHM,2023-05-17,Celsius Holdings and PacWest Bancorp have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/celsius-holdings-pacwest-bancorp-highlighted-114611683.html,1684237571,STORY,"['GWW', 'CELH', 'PACW', 'PHM', 'STLD']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 16, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Celsius Holdings CELH as the Bull of the Day and PacWest Bancorp PACW as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Pulte Group PHM, Steel Dynamics STLD and W.W. Grainger GWW.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Healthy energy drink maker Celsius Holdings is currently one of the most compelling growth stories on Wall Street. The company is separating itself from the pack with its delicious and healthy carbonated and non-carbonated energy drinks. Under the ""Essential Energy"" brand, the company offers sparkling and carbonated options in various flavors clinically proven to burn body fat and speed up the metabolism while exercising. Celsius also offers ""Smartly Sweetened"", ""Performance Energy"", and ""Recovery Fuel"". Unlike many of its competitors, Celsius energy drinks use no aspartame, high fructose corn syrup, added sodium, or artificial flavors.Record EarningsLast Wednesday, CELH shares were energized by the company's first-quarter earnings results. Revenue grew 94% year-over-year, while EPS shot higher by 344%. CELH bested Zacks Consensus Estimates by a wide margin of 81.82%. President and Chief Executive Officer John Fieldly said, ""During the first quarter of 2023, Celsius delivered an all-time quarterly record revenue of $260 million in sales and over $34 million in net income, driven by expanded availability and increased consumer awareness. In addition, we continue to further transition into Pepsi's best-in-class distribution system.""Caffeinated Earnings ForecastsWhen determining a stock's prospects, forward earnings estimates supersede current earnings. Celsius is a company that boasts both. For full-year 2023, Zacks Consensus Estimates forecast 149.43% EPS growth, year-over-year.Beyond the strong forecast, analysts raised estimates following the recent earnings report – another bullish sign.Story continuesPrice &amp; Volume After the hefty price move earlier in the week, it's understandable that investors wonder whether buying Celsius at these levels is chasing. However, CELH is showing all the classic signs of a breakaway gap. A breakaway gap occurs at the beginning of a move when a stock gaps above prior resistance.Breakaway gaps typically have 3 characteristics inherent in them, including:·      Massive volume: Heavier than average volume turnover signifies strong demand on the price gap. Last Wednesday, CELH's volume swelled to levels 575% above the norm.·      Large price move: Small gaps typically get filled, while large gaps tend to spark new trends. CELH closed higher by nearly 20% and finished near the top of the daily price range.·      Break above resistance: CELH broke out of a five-month base structure. Bulls will not need to fight overhead supply now that the stock is back to fresh highs.ConclusionCelsius has all the ingredients of a winning stock, including a unique product offering, strong current and future earnings growth, and signs of heavy buying demand from a price and volume perspective.Bear of the Day:Since March, the following banks have collapsed or have been sold for pennies on the dollar: Signature Bank of New York, Silvergate Capital, Silicon Valley Bank, First Republic and Credit Suisse.Though Fed Chairman Jerome Powell called the U.S. banking system ""strong"" a week and a half ago, clearly, markets disagree. Unfortunately for Powell, he has no real choice in the matter – if he calls the banking system weak, it will induce more bank runs and withdrawals.PacWest Company OverviewPacWest Bancorp is a Los Angeles-based bank holding company with one wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Pacific Western Bank. The company provides commercial banking services, including real estate, construction and commercial loans, and comprehensive deposit and treasury management services to small and medium-size businesses.Is PacWest the Next Domino to Fall?In the fourth quarter of 2022, PACW experienced withdrawals of roughly $5 billion. Since then, deposits have stabilized. However, any way you spin it, PacWest's first quarter earnings announcement was disappointing, to say the least. Earnings growth slowed by 35% versus last year. Though the company reported adjusted earnings of $0.66 per share, non-adjusted earnings careened lower to a loss of $10.22 a share.Beyond the fluctuations in deposits held and the negative earnings trajectory, one of the biggest concerns for investors is the skyrocketing debt of the company. In 2023 alone, the debt-to-equity ratio has skyrocketed by more than 400%.Though PacWest is currently solvent, one primary concern is the current narrative in the regional banking sector. As customers see regional banking stocks tanking, they may shift their money to larger ""household"" banking names such as JP Morgan or Bank of America. In other words, the narrative around the company and its falling stock price may trigger a self-fulfilling phenomenon.Technical ViewPacWest's price action is the definition of relative weakness. Over the past twelve months, PACW has underperformed 99% of its peers. The stock remains steeped in a downtrend, and until it can get back over the 50-day moving average, it should be considered an avoid.ConclusionPacWest is a bank at the heart of the current regional banking crisis. PACW suffers from soaring debt, lackluster earnings, and abysmal price action. Barring any government or FDIC intervention, investors should avoid the stock.Additional content:3 Top-Ranked Stocks with Substantial Share Buyback ProgramsStock buybacks, also known as share repurchase programs, are one of several ways for companies to return cash to shareholders. By absorbing a portion of the outstanding shares, a company effectively reduces the share count implicitly boosting the share price.Companies will do this when the stock is undervalued, or there are limited reinvestment opportunities currently available. Buybacks aren't without limitations though as there are plenty of ways for companies to enact them in a poor way. However, many of the best companies have a long history of strategically buying back shares at the benefit of investors.Seeing a chart of declining shares outstanding can be one strong indicator of responsible management, and a stock that has likely been trending higher. To further improve the likelihood of buying a good stock, investors can utilize Zacks proprietary research, which identifies stocks with an elevated probability of moving higher in the near term.In this article I will cover three stocks that have considerably reduced their outstanding shares over the last decade, have a strong performing stock, and a high Zacks Rank.  Pulte Group, Steel Dynamics and W.W. Grainger fit all those criteria.Pulte Group Pulte Group is a homebuilder and financial services company based in the US. The Homebuilding segment offers a wide variety of home designs including single family detached, townhouses, condominiums, and duplexes at different prices. The financial services segment is just 2% of total revenues and offers mortgage banking and title services.Pulte Group has been a persistent buyer of its own shares over the last decade. Over that time the number of shares outstanding has been reduced by 40%. Also in the last decade, PHM shares have compounded at an annual rate of 12.6%, slightly edging out the returns of the S&amp;P 500.Revenues over the last ten years have grown tremendously as well, nearly tripling from $5.8 billion in 2014, to $16.8 billion today. PHM has been extremely generous to its shareholders, significantly increasing dividends over that period as well. With growing revenues, and dividends in addition to the share buybacks, PHM's stock price appreciation is clearly more than just financial engineering.Pulte Group is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 7.5x, which is below the industry average of 10x, and below its 10-year median of 10.4x. PHM also boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions.Steel DynamicsSteel Dynamics is among the leading steel producers and metal recyclers in the US. It currently has steelmaking and coating capacity of around 16 million tons. STLD is one of the most diversified steel companies in the country with a vast range of specialty products. The company makes and markets steel products, processes and sells recycled ferrous and nonferrous metals, and fabricates and sells steel joist and decking products internationally.Steel Dynamics is another company that has made huge efforts to consistently buy back shares. Between 2016 and today, total shares outstanding have been reduced by 30%. Also, over that period revenues have tripled from $7.7 billion to $21.6 billion, and dividends per share have also tripled.Like Pulte Group, Steel Dynamics stock has clearly rallied for reasons other than its share buybacks, namely the marked growth in revenues and investor friendly dividend payouts. Since 2016 STLD has compounded at an annual rate of 24%, doubling the annual returns of the broad market index.STLD is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 5.9x, which is below the industry average 6.6x, and below its 10-year median of 12x. With such a relatively low valuation as well as a Zack Rank #2 (Buy), STLD is a worthy consideration for investors looking at stocks buying back shares.W.W. GraingerW.W. Grainger is a business-to-business distributor of maintenance, repair and operating (MRO) products and services. Its operations are primarily in North America, Japan, and the U.K. Its customers represent a wide array of industries including government, manufacturing, transportation, commercial and contractors. Its products include material-handling equipment, safety and security supplies, lighting and electrical products, power and hand tools, pumps and plumbing supplies, cleaning and maintenance supplies, and metalworking tools.W.W. Grainer's 20-year buyback campaign has reduced its outstanding shares by 45% over that time. Over that period revenues have tripled from $5 billion to $15 billion and earnings per share have 10x'd $3.02 to $32.21 per share.GWW clearly loves its investors as dividends have also been trending higher over the last 20 years. Dividends per share have climbed from $0.79 in 2004 to $6.88 per share today.GWW is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 19x, which is in line with the industry average and just below its 10-year median of 20. W.W. Grainger also has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions.Bottom LineThese three stocks have shown a history of returning huge amounts of money to investors through both stock buybacks and dividends. Actions like this are typical of stocks with strong long-term returns. Additionally, with the current high Zacks Ranks, they have good chances of good returns in the near-term as well.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Thus, you can purchase Johnson &amp; Johnson's shares before the 22nd of May in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 6th of June.The company's upcoming dividend is US$1.19 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$4.76 per share to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Johnson &amp; Johnson has a trailing yield of 3.0% on the current share price of $159.34. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Johnson &amp; Johnson's dividend is reliable and sustainable. So we need to investigate whether Johnson &amp; Johnson can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. See our latest analysis for Johnson &amp; Johnson If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Last year, Johnson &amp; Johnson paid out 93% of its income as dividends, which is above a level that we're comfortable with, especially if the company needs to reinvest in its business. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Over the last year it paid out 73% of its free cash flow as dividends, within the usual range for most companies.It's good to see that while Johnson &amp; Johnson's dividends were not well covered by profits, at least they are affordable from a cash perspective. Still, if the company continues paying out such a high percentage of its profits, the dividend could be at risk if business turns sour.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. It's encouraging to see Johnson &amp; Johnson has grown its earnings rapidly, up 57% a year for the past five years.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Johnson &amp; Johnson has delivered an average of 6.9% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.Final TakeawayHas Johnson &amp; Johnson got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Johnson &amp; Johnson has been growing its earnings per share nicely, although judging by the difference between its profit and cashflow payout ratios, the company might have reported some write-offs over the last year. All things considered, we are not particularly enthused about Johnson &amp; Johnson from a dividend perspective.If you're not too concerned about Johnson &amp; Johnson's ability to pay dividends, you should still be mindful of some of the other risks that this business faces. For example - Johnson &amp; Johnson has 5 warning signs we think you should be aware of.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

J&amp;J has said that its talc products are safe and do not cause cancer. It is attempting for a second time to resolve more than 38,000 lawsuits in bankruptcy and prevent new cases from coming forward in the future.LTL's bankruptcy plan would pay $400 million into a separate trust for claims filed by state attorneys general alleging that J&amp;J violated state unfair business practices and consumer protection laws by misleading consumers about the safety of its talc products.Several states had begun consumer protection actions against J&amp;J before LTL's first bankruptcy filing stopped those investigations from moving forward in 2021. New Mexico and Mississippi had already filed lawsuits against Johnson &amp; Johnson before then, and the states of Arizona, Maryland, North Carolina, Texas and Washington had issued civil investigative demands or subpoenas, according to LTL's court documents.New Mexico and Mississippi have moved to dismiss LTL's bankruptcy, joining cancer victims and the U.S. Justice Department's bankruptcy watchdog, who have argued that a profitable company like J&amp;J cannot benefit from bankruptcy protections meant for struggling debtors.LTL's first attempt at resolving the lawsuits in bankruptcy was dismissed after similar arguments, when a U.S. appeals court ruled that LTL was not in ""financial distress"" and ineligible for bankruptcy protection. LTL filed a second bankruptcy just over two hours after that dismissal, arguing that its second attempt was different because it had less money available and more support for a settlement.Story continuesNew Mexico and Mississippi said in their motion to dismiss that LTL's renewed bankruptcy violates state law enforcement powers by attempting unilaterally to cap the company's liability for state consumer protection actions.LTL's new filings also included more details on how the company would evaluate and pay cancer claims if the bankruptcy plan is approved.The highest payments under the settlement would be $500,000 for people diagnosed with terminal mesothelioma before age 45, and $260,000 for people diagnosed with terminal ovarian cancer before age 45.From there, the proposed settlement applies discounts depending on the type and severity of cancer, the individual's age, history of talc use and other factors. For example, a woman who used talc products weekly, had a family history of ovarian cancer and was diagnosed with stage II ovarian cancer at age 55 could be in line for a $21,125 payout under the plan.(Reporting by Dietrich Knauth, Editing by Will Dunham and Alexia Garamfalvi)]"

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this world's biggest maker of health care products have returned -3.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which Johnson &amp; Johnson falls in, has gained 0.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to post earnings of $2.62 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.66 points to a change of +5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1.6%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.01 indicates a change of +3.2% from what Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.6%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Johnson &amp; Johnson.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for JNJ _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Johnson &amp; Johnson, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $24.64 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +2.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $98.83 billion and $101.04 billion estimates indicate +4.1% and +2.2% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryJohnson &amp; Johnson reported revenues of $24.75 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.6%. EPS of $2.68 for the same period compares with $2.67 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $23.57 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.01%. The EPS surprise was +6.77%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Johnson &amp; Johnson is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Johnson &amp; Johnson. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Medtronic AI technology was a standout from a field of nearly 4,000 nominations globally.Medtronic AccuRhythm AI technology receives 2023 MedTech Breakthrough Award as Best New Monitoring SolutionMedTech Breakthrough, an independent market intelligence organization that recognizes the top companies, technologies and products in the global health and medical technology market, conducts the MedTech Breakthrough Awards program. The LINQ family of insertable cardiac monitors (ICMs) provide continuous, long-term monitoring for patients with increased risk of abnormal heart rhythms who experience infrequent symptoms including dizziness, palpitations, syncope (fainting) and chest pain, thereby requiring long-term monitoring or ongoing management.""We are thrilled to win the MedTech Breakthrough Award for a technology that makes such a profound impact on patients and helps clinicians focus on cardiac events that are most relevant,"" said Stacey Churchwell, vice president and general manager of the Cardiovascular Diagnostics and Services business within the Cardiac Rhythm Management Operating Unit. ""We look forward to building on this AI technology with future enhancements across our LINQ family of ICMs.""Medtronic introduced AccuRhythm™ AI algorithms in 2022 to patients and clinicians in Australia, countries throughout Europe, the United States, and New Zealand to help improve the accuracy of information physicians receive so they can better treat their patients. The two AI algorithms — specific to the most common ICM false alerts, atrial fibrillation (AF) and pause (asystole) 1, 2 — have been shown to reduce the number of false alerts by as much as 84%, saving clinicians approximately 319 hours of clinic review time annually (for every 200 LINQ II patients).3Story continuesAn enhancement to the AF algorithm for the LINQ II ICM further reduces AF false alerts, which is anticipated to further reduce clinic review time.4AccuRhythm AI Expanded to Reveal LINQ ICMs Medtronic also announced U.S. Food and Drug Administration market clearance to apply the AccuRhythm AI algorithms to the Reveal LINQ™ ICM, the predecessor to the LINQ II ICM, via cloud-based updates. Medtronic anticipates the AccuRhythm AI algorithms to reduce approximately 89.5% of AF false alerts and 80.2% of pause false alerts with Reveal LINQ, while preserving true alerts at a rate of 98.2% and 99.9%, respectively. Health care providers have used the Reveal LINQ ICM to care for more than 750,000 patients globally since 2014. The AccuRhythm AI update for the Reveal LINQ ICM will also be available in Europe.""Adding AccuRhythm AI to the thousands of Reveal LINQ ICMs currently implanted in patients globally is important as it will help reduce the data burden on many hospitals and clinics that still regularly use this device for monitoring their patients,"" said Alan Cheng, M.D., vice president and chief medical officer for Cardiac Rhythm Management Operating Unit, which is part of the Cardiovascular Portfolio at Medtronic. Medtronic developed the AccuRhythm AI platform and algorithms using its proprietary, diverse and debiased database of more than one million electrocardiogram heart rhythm episodes. Medtronic will continue to apply AccuRhythm AI in the cloud automatically to facilitate seamless care for patients. The AccuRhythm AI algorithms for the Reveal LINQ ICM and updated AF algorithm for LINQ II are anticipated to go live later this year.

The firm emphasizes the importance of analyzing market trends and using quantitative methods to identify potential investment opportunities. In addition to this, the hedge fund also provides personalized investment advice to individual clients. Over the years, the firm grew and expanded its client base, managing portfolios for high-net-worth individuals, institutions, and pension funds. As of May, Fisher’s real-time net worth stands at $6.7 billion.High interest rates have been a cause of worry for investors this year as interest rates reached their 16-year high. The Fed’s efforts to fight inflation have had significant impacts on the investment strategies of investors in the US. According to Fisher, Fed decisions do not have a long-term impact on the stock market’s performance. He thinks investors should follow their long-term investment strategy by avoiding short-term volatility caused by continuous interest rate hikes.Recently, Fisher Investments announced that it would relocate its corporate headquarters to Texas, following Washington’s supreme court ruling which upheld that the capital gains tax is constitutional on the state’s wealthiest residents, according to a report by Bloomberg. The firm will also increase employee transfers over time.As of the close of the first quarter of 2023, Fisher Asset Management’s portfolio was valued at nearly $165.1 billion, up from $148 billion in the preceding quarter.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is a provider of health care solutions including prescription medicines, vaccines, biologic therapies, animal health and consumer care products. Shares have benefited from investors seeking safety in areas with less economic and interest rate sensitivity. With about one third of its sales generated by blockbuster oncology drug Keytruda, the key issue for investors is the success of its large R&amp;D pipeline to replace those sales when Keytruda comes off patent in 2028. However, Merck seems to be getting little credit from investors for the 60+ programs it has in clinical development, despite having several solid and large new product opportunities. Additionally, the company’s strong balance sheet and robust free cash flow provide it multiple options for future partnerships and acquisitions, besides return of capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases.”14.

(NYSE:GS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Back in 2019, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) made a splash in the card industry by working with Apple and MasterCard on a credit card. The actual card is fairly sleek (as you can see below), as customers names are etched into an Apple titanium card. The no-fee card generated a lot of hype, as many early users were quick to post their latest card on various social media sites.The initial goal of Marcus (back in 2016) was to leverage Goldman’s wonderful name brand and build a full-service digital bank. This card was a large piece of GS’s ambitions to grow its retail banking franchise called Marcus. After 5 years, Marcus now has 14 million customers and $16 billion in loan balances. Surprisingly, Marcus now represents nearly 20% of the firm’s total revenue.We thought it would be interesting to look how the Apple Card is doing in terms of loans and exposures. With over $100 billion in assets, this has been a successful source of cheap deposits for GS. Despite having an institutional / “white shoe” brand in the investment banking and trading world, GS’s Apple Card has been a disappointment.” (Click here to read the full text)11.

Among these hedge funds, Eagle Capital Management was the company's leading stakeholder in Q4.Here is what Madison Dividend Income Fund has to say about Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“This quarter we are highlighting Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) as a relative yield example in the Financial sector. MS is a leading investment bank and wealth management firm with approximately $5 trillion of client assets under management. It merged Citigroup’s Smith Barney business into its own wealth management business after the 2008 recession/financial crisis, which resulted in a more stable business model. Recent acquisitions of asset manager Eaton Vance and E-Trade provide additional stability and higher returns on capital. We believe MS has a sustainable competitive advantage due to its size and scale, global reach, strong reputation, and financial distribution capabilities. Importantly for a financial institution, it is in good financial health as key leverage ratios including common equity Tier 1 ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio, Tier 1 leverage ratio, and supplementary leverage ratio were all well above required minimums at the end of 2021.Our thesis on MS is that its wealth management business will continue to become a larger part of the overall company, which will increase overall margins and return on equity (ROE). Wealth management and asset management are less cyclical than investment banking, and often generate higher margins and provide better stability of financial results. For example, the addition of Smith Barney added significant scale and boosted wealth management operating margins from below 10% into the mid-20%s over the past several years while also increasing returns on equity. Looking ahead, we believe the company will benefit from rising asset prices and higher interest rates, should they happen over time…” (Click here to see the full text)9. Caterpillar Inc.

Here is what the firm has to say:“We trimmed Mastercard and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) to equal weights of the Portfolio. Mastercard and Visa operate as a duopoly in a large and growing market. Over the last 50 years, global personal consumer expenditures (PCE) has grown 7-9% annualized. We expect 4-5% long-term PCE growth going forward. Additionally, the shift from cash to credit continues unabated, with a total credit penetration of only approximately 50% globally.3 This shift provides Visa and Mastercard with another ~4-6% of growth. When combined with PCE, this gives both companies high-single-digit to low-double[1]digit revenue growth opportunities. This growth estimate is before accounting for growth amplifiers like the acceleration of e[1]commerce, the shift from offline to online, and additional services. Both companies enjoy extremely strong network effects that provide strong competitive advantages.We have trimmed Visa and Mastercard because their combined weight grew to over 12% of the Global Growth Portfolio because of their recent performance and to fund our increase in Amazon’s position size. We added to both positions when their prices were depressed due to cross-border transactions deteriorating materially from the pandemic. Cross-border volumes came roaring back when travel corridors reopened, and although we are several quarters removed from the cross-border nadir, Visa still grew volumes &gt;30% in 1Q23. Total cross-border volumes are now 132% of 2019 levels. At 4.5% each, both companies remain high conviction positions for Global Growth.”7.

IPAR, Rockwell Automation, Inc. ROK and MicroStrategy Inc. MSTR.3 Momentum Anomaly Stocks to Buy as Market Witnesses DowntrendThe equity markets witnessed a downtrend over the past couple of days as concerns related to the health of the overall U.S. economy remained an overhang on investor sentiments. Preliminary data from the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index for May 2023 fell to a six-month low of 57.7 compared to broad-based expectations of a reading of 63.0. Despite improving job market conditions, investors remained worried about a probable recession later this year. Uncertainty over an amicable solution to the debt ceiling crisis further compounded the market gloom.A weaker-than-expected wholesale prices data – often considered a sign of easing inflation – further failed to ease the concerns of a downturn. Wholesale prices rose just 0.2% in April compared with wide expectations of a 0.3% rise. The consumer price index increased 0.4% in April, equating to a 4.9% annual inflation rate – the lowest reading since April 2021. However, lingering financial market stress and uncertain business conditions failed to cheer the markets.With uncertainty becoming the norm of the day, investors often seek to employ time-tested winning strategies to fetch sustained profits. One of the most successful game plans to beat the blues is to bet on momentum stocks when value or growth investing fails to generate the desired profits.This approach primarily tends to follow the adage, ""the trend is your friend."" At its core, momentum investing is ""buying high and selling higher."" It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend, it is more likely to continue in that direction because of the momentum that is already behind it. But before we delve deep into it, let us try to fathom why does the momentum strategy at all work?Story continuesThere are several behavioral biases that most investors exhibit in their decision-making. And these emotional responses, or rather mistakes, are the very reason that makes the momentum strategy work.For example, some investors are anxious about booking losses and hence hold on to losing stocks for too long, hopeful of a rebound in prices. On the other hand, a few investors sell their winners way too early. Momentum investing is one of the best strategies to avoid making such errors in judgment.Furthermore, investors initially tend to underreact to news, events or data releases. However, once things become clear, they have a habit of going with the flow and overreacting, causing dramatic price reactions. These behavioral problems extend trends, thus opening up huge opportunities for momentum players.To sum up, momentum investing is a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future. It is based on that gap in time before the mean reversion occurs, i.e., before prices become rational again.In this context, stocks like Inter Parfums, Inc., Rockwell Automation, Inc. and MicroStrategy Inc. are worth betting on.Momentum strategies have been known to be alpha-generative over a long period and across market stages. So, this strategy is quite tricky to implement, as detecting these trends is no child's play.Here, we have created a strategy to help investors get in on these fast movers and rake in handsome gains.

Iranian officials did not immediately acknowledge the incident involving the aircraft.“Our engineering team is undertaking the necessary measures to safely bring the aircraft back to Muscat,” the airline said in an online statement. It described the route as operating as a chartered flight and that those stuck had been provided accommodation in Shiraz, some 680 kilometers (420 miles) southeast of Tehran.However, other airlines have faced challenges in bringing back damaged aircraft. U.S. sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program have barred spare aviation parts from being on hand in the Islamic Republic. That complicates repairs on aircraft from both Boeing Co. and Airbus, which have American-made parts.In December 2018, a brand-new Boeing 737 Max flown by Norwegian Air Shuttle landed in Shiraz after a fault in one of its engines while flying from Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. The aircraft remained stuck on the ground there for several months before finally leaving.The airport in Shiraz, like many others in the Mideast, is used by both commercial and military flights.Iran and Oman have maintained close relations through the decades, even amid Tehran's tensions with its Gulf Arab neighbors and the U.S. Oman frequently has served as an interlocutor for the West with Iran.]"

(NASDAQ: ILMN), a global leader in DNA sequencing and array-based technologies, today recognized the progress and impact of genomic technologies on pathogen preparedness and response. Following the boost in sequencing infrastructure and capabilities driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, today genomic technologies are enabling public health agencies and health care systems to better prepare for, and respond to, pathogenic threats.By sequencing the genomes of dangerous pathogens, scientists can better understand how they spread and how to best control them to protect human and animal health as well as the environment. For example, public health officials across the US are using Illumina technology to conduct wastewater surveillance for SARS-CoV-2, polio, and pathogens whose antimicrobial resistance poses an existential threat to human health.From the onset of the pandemic in 2020, Illumina's pathogen genomic surveillance solutions were deployed to characterize the genome of SARS-CoV-2, catalyze development and updates to vaccines and diagnostics, identify virus variants of concern, and monitor the virus's evolution and spread. As the World Health Organization (WHO) and countries including the United States have begun declaring an end to their states of public health emergency, COVID-19 continues to present a complicated global public health challenge.""Even with the end of the public health emergency, there are individuals, communities, and economies deeply impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic; continued vigilance by public health agencies and access to testing, genomic surveillance, vaccines, and treatments is required,"" said Dr. Phil Febbo, chief medical officer of Illumina. ""While we all want to move past the pandemic, by building on the capabilities established during that time, we have the opportunity to keep COIVD-19 controlled and become better prepared for the predictable introduction of future pathogens.""Genomic surveillanceAccording to the WHO, genomic surveillance is ""the process of constantly monitoring pathogens and analyzing their genetic similarities and differences."" It has already been used in a focused way with relatively limited capacity to track pathogens, for example in 2013 by the Food and Drug Administration for its GenomeTrackr program, which gathered data from over 100 laboratories performing routine surveillance of the American food supply, many using Illumina technology. This program run in partnership with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Department of Agriculture, enhanced monitoring for foodborne pathogens, and guided the response to foodborne disease outbreaks.Story continuesThe COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of genomic surveillance at-scale to support the global response and reduced the barriers for sharing data internationally. This enabled the tracking of viral evolution and movement in the global population in a manner, scale and timeframe not previously possible. By sequencing the genomes of dangerous pathogens, today scientists can better understand how they spread and how to best control them to protect human and animal health as well as the environment.Since 2020, these expanded capabilities have been applied to public health threats in the US, including mpox, highly pathogenic avian influenza, and other notable respiratory pathogens. Surveillance data provides scientists with a clearer picture from which public health officials can make recommendations and manage outbreaks.For example, officials at the city, county, and state levels across the US have begun using Illumina technology to conduct wastewater surveillance for SARS-CoV-2, polio, and pathogens whose antimicrobial resistance poses an existential threat to human health.This type of genomic surveillance is opening new doors to understanding the patterns of pathogen transmission at population scale. A recently published article in The Lancet, ""A global aircraft-based wastewater genomic surveillance network for early warning of future pandemics,"" asserts that this type of surveillance could be a critical component of a comprehensive global pandemic early warning system.Outside of United States, the genomic surveillance infrastructure and framework developed in response to COVID-19 has already been applied to respond to outbreaks of other viral threats, such as Marburg virus in Tanzania and Ebola virus in Uganda. In Brazil, Illumina genomic surveillance solutions played a critical role in the response to a major Dengue virus outbreak, supporting the public health response.A proactive approach""There is significant work underway globally to build capacity and capabilities to enable pandemic preparedness and response,"" said Vanessa Moeder, senior director of Global Health at Illumina. ""We need to establish clear expectations for future pathogen surveillance—with defined targets to detect, investigate, and respond to potential threats. Genomics plays a profound role in robust surveillance efforts. By enabling comprehensive characterization of circulating pathogens, we can deeply understand them, rapidly respond with countermeasures, and ultimately save lives. It helps move public health officials from a reactive to more proactive position.""Beginning in 2021, a rise in reported outbreaks in hospitals and nursing homes of the dangerous fungus ̶Candida auris called for quick genomic surveillance activation to identify where infections were occurring. In an article featured on Illumina.com, Andrew Gorzalski, PhD, Nevada State Health Lab molecular supervisor, commented on how the more robust sequencing infrastructure his lab established to monitor COVID-19 bolstered its readiness to respond to subsequent threats.""We're getting sequencing results out faster than we're getting susceptibility results back from our regional laboratory, so that allows us to identify those infections that are genotypically drug resistant, and then pass that information along to epidemiologists,"" he said.C. auris is just one of many multidrug-resistant, health-care-associated infections that American health systems are monitoring through genomics. The Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare-Associated Transmission, established by infectious disease experts at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and funded by the National Institute of Health, combines routine genomic surveillance of bacterial pathogens with machine learning and data mining of electronic medical records to identify outbreaks not detected by traditional methods.Expanding access to genomic technology globally As Illumina celebrates its 25th anniversary in 2023, its mission of unlocking the power of the genome includes expanding access to genomic capabilities, to ensure their benefits are available to all.The pandemic spurred an expansion of next-generation sequencing infrastructure in countries and regions that previously had little or no access to it.In Africa, several programs, including the Pathogen Genomics Initiative, have rapidly expanded capacity and knowledge. Africa CDC has set the target for all 55 African Union member countries to establish next-generation sequencing capacity and pathogen genomics capabilities within the next two years. This will enable countries to better manage their own unique infectious disease threats, rather than having to ship samples to Europe or the US, which leads to prolonged response times.In Central and South America, over 30 nations and territories now actively participate in the COVID-19 Genomics Surveillance Regional Network (COVIGEN). This represents a vital expansion of sequencing capacity in the region since the network's establishment in early 2020. Pan American Health Organization member states committed in 2022 to expanding pathogen genomics capacity in the region over the next five years.""Maintaining focus on the importance of preparedness and response is critical,"" said Moeder. ""We are committed to remaining at the forefront of leveraging genomics against infectious disease and partnering worldwide to share expertise to ensure that these capabilities are available everywhere, so that pathogens have nowhere to hide.""About IlluminaIllumina is improving human health by unlocking the power of the genome.

But in any portfolio, there are likely to be some stocks that fall short of that benchmark. We regret to report that long term Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) shareholders have had that experience, with the share price dropping 14% in three years, versus a market return of about 43%. The share price has dropped 21% in three months. We note that the company has reported results fairly recently; and the market is hardly delighted. You can check out the latest numbers in our company report.After losing 3.4% this past week, it's worth investigating the company's fundamentals to see what we can infer from past performance. Check out our latest analysis for Skyworks Solutions While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During the unfortunate three years of share price decline, Skyworks Solutions actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 15% per year. This is quite a puzzle, and suggests there might be something temporarily buoying the share price. Or else the company was over-hyped in the past, and so its growth has disappointed.Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.Revenue is actually up 17% over the three years, so the share price drop doesn't seem to hinge on revenue, either. This analysis is just perfunctory, but it might be worth researching Skyworks Solutions more closely, as sometimes stocks fall unfairly. This could present an opportunity.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-and-revenue-growthIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. This free report showing analyst forecasts should help you form a view on Skyworks SolutionsStory continuesWhat About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Skyworks Solutions the TSR over the last 3 years was -9.9%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveInvestors in Skyworks Solutions had a tough year, with a total loss of 7.6% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 0.8%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 1.0%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Skyworks Solutions better, we need to consider many other factors.

The award has been offered by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Detroit Arsenal, MI.Valued at $17.6 million, this contract is expected to be completed by May 24, 2024. The work related to this deal will be executed in Sterling Heights, MI.The contract involves foreign military sales to Kuwait and Poland.Significance of the Abrams TankThe M1A2 SEPv3 Abrams is the most advanced main battle tank. It boasts features that are technologically advanced in terms of communications, fire control and lethality, reliability, sustainment and fuel efficiency, along with an upgraded armor. The SEPv3 Abrams is also designed to seamlessly accept future upgrades.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?Military tanks are the primary offensive weapons in the land mission of the military. An efficient armored military tank enables the army to carry out any mission by direct fire. Moreover, the recent tiff between Ukraine and Russia has accelerated the pace of upgrading the defense landscape with technologically advanced arms and ammunition, which, in turn, has led to increased investments in military tanks.In this context, it is imperative to mention that the increased focus on technologically advanced combat vehicles is likely to benefit General Dynamics as its Land System business unit is a prime contractor of land combat vehicles for the U.S. Navy. It provides innovative design, engineering, technology, production and full life-cycle support for land combat vehicles worldwide.Its excellence and in-depth experience in building combat vehicles, coupled with a customer-first focus and a seasoned supply-chain network, has been leveraging the company to win multiple contracts from the U.S. Army and its allies. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.Such an upward trend in demand is likely to bolster GD’s revenue generation prospects from its Land System business unit and boost the company’s overall top line.Story continuesGrowth ProspectsThe changing dynamics of the military landscape and the rising geopolitical tension have made it mandatory for a country to continuously evolve and strengthen its defense structure. To this end, military tanks form an integral part of any combat mission and land warfare affair.Per a report from Markets and Markets, the global armored vehicle market is projected to witness a CAGR of 3.1% during the 2022-2027 period. Such abounding growth trends indicate ample growth opportunities for General Dynamics as it enjoys a lucrative position in the armored vehicle market.A few defense primes that can reap the multitude of gains from the expanding armored vehicle market are BAE Systems BAESY, Northrop Grumman NOC and Raytheon Technologies RTX.BAE System’s Challenger 2 is a heavily armored and highly mobile battle tank, designed for use in the direct fire zone. Its primary role is to destroy or neutralize the armor. It also has the ability to engage both hard and soft targets and can operate across a spectrum of high-intensity conflicts, counter insurgencies and peacekeeping roles.BAESY’s long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 13.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2023 sales indicates an improvement of 25.4% from that reported in the previous year.Northrop Grumman is the world’s top producer of medium-caliber live and training ammunition and gun systems, with more than 5 million units built in the last five years. It specializes in innovating low-cost, highly reliable precise weapons and ammunition for artillery and mortar systems, medium-caliber weapon platforms, battle tanks and individual soldiers.NOC has a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2023 sales indicates an improvement of 4.7% from the year-ago reported figure.Raytheon is currently teaming up with American Rheinmetall Vehicles to meet the U.S. Army’s current requirement for a true, next-generation Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle, namely the Lynx Infantry Fighting Vehicle. The Lynx Infantry Fighting Vehicle is a next-generation, tracked, armored fighting vehicle designed to address the critical challenges of the future battlefield.RTX’s long-term earnings growth rate is currently pegged at 8.3%.

It is not expected to have a material impact on Ansys' consolidated financial statements in 2023.Ansys logo. (PRNewsFoto/ANSYS, Inc.)Diakopto develops products that address the growing complexities and unintended effects of designing ICs in the modern era. Semiconductor designs increasingly employ advanced process node technologies, where interconnect parasitic effects limit the performance, reliability, and functionality of designs. Diakopto's market-leading products have been adopted by dozens of customers, including tier-one semiconductor companies, for a broad range of applications.With the acquisition, Ansys will better enable design engineers to ""shift left,"" and to detect interconnect parasitic problems early in the design cycle. Diakopto's products provide actionable analytics to guide designers to fix these problems – a capability that has not existed before. Through early identification and what-if analysis of parasitic problems, engineers can minimize costly iterations late in the design cycle – furthering cost and time savings.Story continues""Diakopto's culture of strong engineering excellence and its innovative and highly differentiated products create a natural alignment with our organization. We are eager to welcome their team to the Ansys family,"" said Shane Emswiler, senior vice president of products at Ansys. ""Incorporating Diakopto's unique methodology will support designers using Ansys to quickly and easily pinpoint the few elements, out of billions, causing bottlenecks. Designers can then optimize and debug designs more efficiently for enhanced IC performance and reliability, and accelerate time to market. The acquisition will complement Ansys' existing offerings for engineers at every level as Diakopto's intuitive and out-of-the-box experience doesn't require extensive training or complicated setups or configurations.""""Today's announcement brings together two like-minded companies on the forefront of innovation, and we are excited about becoming part of the Ansys family,"" said Maxim Ershov, CEO and CTO at Diakopto. ""By joining forces with Ansys, we're confident that we can solve a broader set of problems in the chip design workflow together, strengthening offerings for our customers and driving more innovations in high-tech designs for data center, 5G, automotive, and mobile applications.""About AnsysWhen visionary companies need to know how their world-changing ideas will perform, they close the gap between design and reality with Ansys simulation.

(VFC) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Can the Stock Move Higher?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/v-f-vfc-expected-beat-140002928.html,1684245602,STORY,['VFC'],"[The market expects V.F. (VFC) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 23, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis maker of brands such as Vans, North Face and Timberland is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.14 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -68.9%.Revenues are expected to be $2.74 billion, down 2.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 60% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for V.F.For V.F.The Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +3.70%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that V.F. Will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that V.F. Would post earnings of $0.99 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.12, delivering a surprise of +13.13%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.V.F. Appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A federal judge in New York on Tuesday granted preliminary approval of the settlement that was filed late Monday.Wells Fargo has been sanctioned repeatedly by U.S. regulators for violations of consumer protection laws going back to 2016, when employees were found to have opened millions of accounts illegally in order to meet unrealistic sales goals.In addition to inflating sales figures that boosted the company's stock, the actions by Wells’ employees caused damage to customers’ credit scores and cost some of them money in fees.San Francisco-based Wells remains under a Federal Reserve order forbidding the bank from growing any larger until the Fed deems that its internal oversight problems are resolved. That order, originally enacted in 2018, was expected to last only a year or two.Since then, executives repeatedly boasted that Wells was cleaning up its act, only for the bank to be found in violation of other parts of consumer protection law, including in its auto and mortgage lending businesses.The shareholder lawsuit related to the settlement announced Tuesday alleged that between May of 2018 and March of 2020, the bank and its senior executives “repeatedly told investors that regulators were satisfied with the bank’s progress under the consent orders and that the asset cap would be timely removed.”However, federal regulators did not lift the cap, and more scandals surfaced.In a statement about the settlement Tuesday, Wells Fargo said, “While we disagree with the allegations in this case, we are pleased to have resolved this matter.”Story continuesLast last year, Wells agreed to pay $3.7 billion to settle charges that it harmed customers by charging illegal fees and interest on auto loans and mortgages, as well as incorrectly applying overdraft fees against savings and checking accounts.Since the fake accounts scandal came to light in 2016, Wells has paid out billions in fines to state and federal regulators, reshuffled its board of directors and seen two CEOs and other top-level executives leave the company. Wells Fargo’s reputation has never fully recovered from the sales scandal.Before the scandal, Wells Fargo was considered to have a sterling reputation among the big banks. But behind the scenes, Wells’ top management was pushing sales goals that were both aggressive and unrealistic.Shares in Wells Fargo ended Tuesday down about 1% at $38.39, approaching 2023 lows.]"

Wells Fargo announcing it has finally settled a shareholder lawsuit tied to that fake-account scandal from 2016. That feels like so long ago because we're looking at other banks now.Now with Wells Fargo, this agreed-on price tag us $1 billion. Shareholders accused the bank, you'll recall, of misleading investors about how quickly Wells Fargo worked to address those problems and risk-management failures that led to that debacle.For anyone who does not remember, this was the scandal where it was discovered that the company-- employees there were opening up fake accounts, including debit and credit accounts, in customer names to reach certain sales goal. And I don't know if you-- sales goals. I don't know if you all remember that there was this eight is great term about, you know, the number of accounts they wanted to open up.JOSH SCHAFER: And one thing that's interesting with this too, Diane, is to think about the other industries or other companies, I guess, this can impact too, right? You go back a couple of months, and Hindenburg Research was essentially accusing the same thing of Block, right? They said that Block had too many accounts that weren't actually real and basically saying, how many of those accounts are real? Because when we talk about investor accounts and just overall accounts at a bank or at a company like Block or at a company like PayPal, that's what people are looking for is what's that revenue per customer?So interesting to see this solved today, Akiko, though I don't think the market was overly interested in it. Not a large move from Wells Fargo today but certainly an interesting story.Story continuesAKIKO FUJITO: Yeah, Josh, you know, I mean, I saw this story, and you sort of go back to, OK, well, this is just the latest in a very long list of settlements Wells Fargo has had to move forward with--DIANE KING HALL: Right.AKIKO FUJITO: --in issues that date back all the way to 2002. Obviously we don't want to conflate all of them, but even within the last six months, we're looking at a settlement of $3.7 billion paid out. In December 2020, $3 billion settlement. That was about allegations of consumer abuse, but there have been a long list of settlements for Wells Fargo. It feels like they just can't get out of the shadows of what happened before. But certainly yet another step that allows them to move forward because their reputation was hit in a big way, and that's kind of putting it mildly.DIANE KING HALL: Right, majorly. I mean, Akiko, you'll recall Senator Elizabeth Warren, who we just did an interview with, held then CEO John Stump's feet to the fire over that. And I remember him just stumbling through his testimony at the time. Banking executives have gotten better at handling this kind of thing, and obviously the banking executives that we saw today was a different-- is a different situation. We're dealing with a collapse. That was an out-and-out scandal, the Wells Fargo situation. So it's interesting just to see a different banking story today when we have some bank executives on Capitol Hill.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, there just seems to be this turmoil overall in the banking sector. And, Akiko, like, to your point, this isn't the first time that Wells Fargo has been involved in these controversies. So you hope that you can move forward and that this doesn't happen again.]"

Woods scheduled a Sept. 8 hearing to consider final approval.Wells Fargo has operated since 2018 under consent orders from the Federal Reserve and two other financial regulators requiring that it improve governance and oversight.The fourth-largest U.S. bank is also subject to an asset cap by the Fed, limiting its growth and its ability to compete with larger rivals JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Bank of America Corp and Citigroup Inc.Shareholders accused Wells Fargo of overstating how well it was complying with those orders, and said the bank's market value fell by more than $54 billion over two years ending in March 2020 as the shortcomings became known.The San Francisco-based bank denied wrongdoing, and settled to eliminate the burden and cost of litigation, court papers show.""While we disagree with the allegations in this case, we are pleased to have resolved this matter,"" Wells Fargo said in a statement.Lawyers for the plaintiffs may seek up to 19% of the settlement fund for legal fees.Wells Fargo has since 2016 paid or set aside several billion dollars to resolve regulatory probes and litigation over its business practices.These practices included opening about 3.5 million accounts without customer permission, and charging hundreds of thousands of borrowers for auto insurance they did not need.Chief Executive Charlie Scharf has said repairing the 171-year-old bank founded by Henry Wells and William Fargo has taken longer than he expected when he took over in 2019.""When I arrived, we did not have the culture, effective processes, or appropriate management oversight in place to remediate weaknesses on a timely basis,"" he said in his March 3 letter to shareholders.

BioMarin Pharmaceuticals Inc, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sarepta Therapeutics, which are all worth more than $10 billion, saw their shares drop between 3% and 7%.Spokespeople for all of the companies either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment. FTC officials did not respond to a request for comment on whether they planned to challenge any other pharmaceutical acquisitions.""The FTC filing a lawsuit to block (the Amgen) deal will dampen M&amp;A enthusiasm across the biotech sector, particularly given the lack of direct portfolio overlap between Amgen and Horizon,"" William Blair analysts wrote in a note.FOCUS ON 'BUNDLING'Story continuesThe FTC said it opposed the deal because it was concerned that Amgen could use rebates to pharmacy benefit managers - middlemen who oversee drug benefits for employers and insurers - in exchange for promoting Horizon's two key products, to the detriment of rivals seeking to compete on price.The products are fast-growing thyroid eye disease treatment Tepezza and gout drug Krystexxa.Seeking to thwart a deal based on the potential for this ""bundling"" practice is a novel approach that regulators had not previously deployed in antitrust cases, analysts and legal experts said.Amgen has said that neither it nor Horizon plan to bundle, and the experts said this line of attack stood a strong chance of being shot down in court.""I don't think (the FTC lawsuit) changes anything long term,"" said one of several Jefferies analysts on a conference call the brokerage hosted for clients on Tuesday to discuss the implications of the regulators' move.Nonetheless, the prospect of other deals facing regulatory challenges spooked investors. Their focus is on Seagen, a major cancer drug developer, whose acquirer, Pfizer, already has some overlap in its product portfolio and pipeline.While Pfizer does not possess the drugs that Seagen specializes in, which combine synthetic antibodies with potent chemicals, the drug giant has a robust portfolio of more than 20 approved cancer medications.""We could see similar challenges to the Pfizer/Seagen deal"" BMO analysts wrote in a note, arguing that the FTC could target other major drug companies with the resources to engage in bundling.UNDER THE RADARConversely, investors and analysts are hoping that smaller pharmaceutical acquisitions will continue to fly under the radar of regulators. This is why the shares of such companies that have pending deals dropped much less on Tuesday.Of the 11 acquisitions of publicly listed biotech companies announced since the start of the year, only Pfizer's acquisition of Seagen was worth well in excess of $10 billion.""Thawing of interest in mega-deals would invariably shift consolidation focus to smaller and earlier-stage biotech companies – and more of them,"" Evercore analysts said in a note.(Reporting by David Carnevali in New York; Editing by Greg Roumeliotis and Jamie Freed)]"
181,5e2cc853-64c6-3819-83b5-7ac0d38f2f7f,PFE,2023-05-17,Guess how much big pharma paid in US taxes on $110 billion of profit in 2022,Quartz,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/guess-much-big-pharma-paid-080000373.html,1684310400,STORY,"['PFE', 'ABBV']","[The logo of AbbVie on a stock exchange monitorContrary to the myth, Americans pay quite a lot of taxes. In 2022, for instance, employees paid an average tax rate of 24.8%, or 0.2% more than in comparable countries. US federal taxes on individual income can be as high as 37%.The same isn’t true for corporations, however. They all pay a flat federal tax rate of 21%, regardless of their profit—a change introduced in 2017 as part of former US president Donald Trump’s corporate tax cuts. Previously they had brackets, too, up to 35%.Read moreA look back at BTS as it became the world's top-selling actYour anxiety brings 4 distinct superpowersAmericans may have seen the last of big rent hikesYet companies often get away with paying much less. For example, eight big pharma players—AbbVie, Amgen, Bristol Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, Gilead, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Merck, and Pfizer—paid just above 2% in US taxes on a combined $110 billion in profits for 2022.Incentives to offshore production and profitIn a hearing before the US Senate’s Committee on Finance on May 11, Brad Setser, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, broke down the income and tax payments (pdf) of the eight big pharma companies, showing how the combination of Trump’s tax cuts and incentives to offshore profits have deprived America’s coffers of billions.The 2017 reform also introduced a tax on global profits at half the federal rate, or 10.5%, to capture some of the foreign profits in low-tax countries. Tangible assets located abroad—for instance, machinery subject to depreciation—were exempted from that taxation, though. That encouraged corporations to produce outside the US, declaring profits where they’re taxed much less.As Setser’s analysis shows (pdf, p. 4), declared profits in countries with low tax rates (like Ireland, Luxembourg, and Singapore) far exceed those in major economies (such as Germany and France) with higher tax rates.And profits declared internationally are much higher than their domestic counterparts. In 2022—an especially profitable year for pharma—the eight biggest US pharmaceuticals companies reported profits of $10 billion domestically on revenue of $214 billion and paid taxes only on that portion. Outside the US, they reported $90 billion in profits on revenue of $171 billion, paying $11 billion in taxes abroad.Story continuesPfizer paid negative US taxes on $42.5 billion in domestic revenueThe tax system is designed in a way that makes it easy to exploit, and pharmaceuticals companies don’t miss their chances. In 2022, for instance, Setser noted in his testimony, AbbVie declared losses of nearly $5 billion in the US—and $20 billion in profits internationally. The company has reported losses in the US every year since 2013, despite the fact that it makes most of its profits there, thanks to its blockbuster arthritis drug Humira.While not so egregious in its offshoring, Pfizer declared making only $5 billion of its $35 billion profit in the US last year, on total domestic sales of $42.5 billion. The company reported US operating losses of $2.9 billion in 2020, $4 billion in 2018, and $6.9 billion 2017—all despite getting most of its revenue domestically. For 2022, Pfizer ended up receiving half a billion dollars in US tax credits, as it did in 2021, and paid $4.2 billion in foreign tax.Of the eight companies analyzed, Gilead was the only one to declare most of its profits domestically ($4 billion out of a $5 billion total). It paid $1.5 billion in US taxes last year—more than Pfizer and AbbVie combined.More from QuartzThe world’s biggest banknote printer said the demand for cash hit a two-decade lowEvery fifth car sold worldwide this year will be electricSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

A separate article by Capital Forum reported that the FTC’s close door meeting on May 12 may have been potentially about Amgen/Horizon Thera peutics transaction.The above articles also mentioned that when they contacted Amgen for comments on the above news, it stated that it will provide “appropriate updates” once more information is available.In the year so far, Horizon Therapeutics’ shares have declined 1.4% compared with the industry’s 6.3% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchReports of a potential lawsuit by the FTC came after Senator Elizabeth Warren wrote to the regulator in late January 2023 expressing her concerns about pharmaceutical deals including the Amgen purchase of Horizon Therapeutics. Per the Senator, both Amgen and Horizon Therapeutics have been engaged in “brazen price increases on drugs that face little or no competition”.Last December, Amgen announced that it will acquire Horizon Therapeutics for $116.50 per share in cash or $27.8 billion. The acquisition will help Amgen add a complementary portfolio of rare disease drugs like Tepezza, Krystexxa and Uplizna to its broad and diversified portfolio and should be accretive to the bottom line by 2024. The acquisition is expected to close by the end of June.Tepezza is approved for treating thyroid eye disease. Krystexxa is used in adults to help reduce the signs and symptoms of gout that are not controlled by other treatments. Uplizna is a prescription medicine used to treat adults with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) who are anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody positive.Story continuesEarlier this March, Pfizer PFE announced that it has offered to acquire Seagen SGEN for $229 per share in cash, which adds up to a total enterprise value of approximately $43.0 billion. Shares of Seagen also fell 3% in after-market hours on May 15, likely due to investors’ concerns that the FTC may look into the Pfizer/Seagen acquisition deal as well.In a recent SEC filing earlier this week, Seagen and Pfizer announced that they have filed documents with the FTC and the Department of Justice in regards to antitrust approval for the transaction.

With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM).ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for International Business Machines How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for International Business Machines is:9.5% = US$2.1b ÷ US$22b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.09 in profit.Does International Business Machines Have A Good Return On Equity?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see International Business Machines has a lower ROE than the average (15%) in the IT industry classification.roeUnfortunately, that's sub-optimal. However, a low ROE is not always bad. If the company's debt levels are moderate to low, then there's still a chance that returns can be improved via the use of financial leverage. When a company has low ROE but high debt levels, we would be cautious as the risk involved is too high.  Our risks dashboard should have the 4 risks we have identified for International Business Machines.Story continuesWhy You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROECompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.International Business Machines' Debt And Its 9.5% ROEIt's worth noting the high use of debt by International Business Machines, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 2.70. Its ROE is quite low, even with the use of significant debt; that's not a good result, in our opinion. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.SummaryReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.Of course International Business Machines may not be the best stock to buy.

(Photo: Shutterstock/FreightWaves)ORLANDO, Fla. — If there were a contest to find the buzzword that sums up the Gartner Supply Chain Symposium, the winner would be clear: AI.Companies boasted about their artificial intelligence bona fides on the floor of the recently concluded show. The flood of emails sent to journalists covering the event, offering up interviews with executives, almost all touted the AI credentials of the companies being pitched. And with international media focused on the capabilities of AI-driven ChatGPT in recent months, supply chain software providers that didn’t boast in Orlando about how they use AI to differentiate themselves would have seemed woefully behind the times.“I would say there are about 1,000 percent more mentions of AI this year than last year,” Keith Hartley, the relatively new CEO at LevaData, said of the conference.Of course, AI within supply chain software is not new. But what is new are the capabilities of ChatGPT and how that generative AI can impact the huge network of supply chain software providers. In a recent paper on the subject, the consulting firm KPMG described generative AI as “an emerging form of AI that can create original articles, essays, images, music, and yes, code, by building on patterns it finds in existing text, audio files, images and software.”What many people at a meeting like Gartner acknowledge in private is that the rows and rows of exhibitors selling software solutions for the supply chain all have products that for some overwhelming majority of their capabilities — is it 90%? It is more? — all do the same thing. There is a basic foundation of functions that needs to be performed in any sort of supply chain technology.But it is those last percentage points that distinguish one solution from another and can be the  difference between success and failure. And with generative AI on top of earlier AI capabilities, it’s clear that this is one of the areas where the battle will be fought.Story continuesIBM demonstrates its Watson solutionOne of the more heavily attended events was a presentation by Rob Cushman, senior partner, worldwide leader – supply chain transformation at IBM, who demonstrated the company’s still-fledgling — and mostly internal — generative AI capabilities that are targeted to its supply chain business.Cushman demonstrated a test case in which IBM’s generative AI capabilities were asked to track parts shortages in a supply chain. IBM has had AI capabilities through its Watson natural language processing service for more than 10 years.His demonstration asked Watson to track the availability of one particular part, and through a series of clicks and written questions, AI would bring up further details on the availability of that part. “What is the stock?” Cushman said, reviewing some of the questions that might be asked. “What’s on order? Do I see gaps in my supply perspective?” The generative AI capabilities in the supply chain provide “an integrated view of what I as a person who owns this part needs to be focused on today as I come online and sit down at my desk.”That was a point that came up in several discussions about AI: It’s not necessarily a job killer. As Cushman said, the data on that part’s availability that is processed by Watson lets the user “make an informed decision” on managing the supply chain.Hartley and LevaData used the occasion of the meeting to roll out the company’s new capabilities that also rely on generative AI. LevaData’s offering support materials sourcing; as he noted during an interview with FreightWaves, a mouse on the table in front of him was manufactured with about 200 individual components, and LevaData’s capabilities assist the company’s clients in the supply chain to secure them.But as he noted, using AI is not new for LevaData. “We’ve been using AI and statistical modeling for a long time, so it’s great that it’s called AI,” he said. “Now it’s generative AI, which we’re adding and moving that way.”An example of LevaData’s generative AI capabilities appears on the company’s web page with this kind of dialogue, similar to what Cushman showed in his IBM presentation.Overhaul is another supply chain software that rolled out a generative AI solution at the Gartner conference, this one in partnership with Microsoft. Overhaul’s value proposition is as a provider of visibility, with particular emphasis on finding immediate risks in a company’s supply chain operations.Microsoft and Overhaul team upDavid Warrick, executive vice president of the Enterprise division at Overhaul, said collaboration with Microsoft enables the company to use the software giant’s ChatGPT capabilities to be bolted onto Overhaul’s RiskGPT product, which identifies risks in a supply chain. Warrick said the product is only being used internally so far.“We have a number of watch officers who are monitoring our platform at all times looking for alert events, like deviations and unscheduled stops,” Warrick said.Introducing the abilities of generative AI into the process, Warrick said, means that “all of our agents are now working off exactly the same set of rules that are being interpreted the same way.” Where in the past an incident might be addressed differently by the company’s “watch officers,” Warrick said the generative AI capabilities now available in RiskGPT would result in a more systematic approach to dealing with risk issues that the Overhaul service discovers.Precisely how the new system will play out will take some time to determine; Warrick said it was introduced in Overhaul’s internal systems only last week.But he added that the capabilities, when opened up to the network of Overhaul users, will not be an add-on service with a separate subscription fee. It will be a standard part of the company’s product offering.Karin Stevens, chief marketing and product officer at Overhaul, said she sees a role for generative AI in training on compliance issues. Generative AI would “eliminate the subjectivity” in many instances, she said, “and we can take out the decision-making about ‘What do I next?’”Dawn Andre, chief product officer of JAGGAER, whose platform manages direct and indirect spending, said in an interview that AI and machine learning usage can have numerous applications that aren’t necessarily as visible as something that is driven by generative AI.“One of the challenges we have today is that the talent is remote, and we are all trying to find a way to bring that expertise into their day-to-day activities, when you don’t have that person sitting in the cube next to you,” Andre said in an interview at the JAGGAER booth on the symposium floor, talking about a use of AI. That sort of expertise can be built into AI-driven applications a company uses in its internal activities, “and it keeps that user and that professional refining their skill set and building their productivity each time they run a process,” Andre said.Those people remain key even as AI and machine learning grow, Andre said, noting that those processes can “automate a lot of mundane tasks” while staff members can “focus more on being strategic.”Although incorporating environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles may be morphing into a political football in certain places, it came up several times over the course of the Gartner conference. None of the references suggested that large portions of the logistics industry has any plans on moving away from integrating ESG into decision-making, whether for internal operations or in selecting companies it does business with.Andre said she sees AI as being able to provide companies with far more detailed ESG information on possible customers and suppliers.AI gives a company an improved ability to determine if a counterparty meets a company’s criteria, Andre said, because it can utilize data both from open sources and internal survey information.“Once we have the data, then [AI] can be used to curate information based on criteria that is unique to me, and whatever initiatives are going on in the priorities for your company,” she said. Through that AI-generated information, Andre said, “the system can source the best candidates to participate in a bid process, not just for a product or lane but somebody who shares the same values.”Still fighting the spreadsheetIf conventional or generative AI seems like such a huge boost to efficiency, shouldn’t rapid adoption be a breeze?Don’t count on it, came the repeated answer at the symposium.At Locus, which describes itself as a dispatch management platform servicing the final mile, Chief Revenue Officer Mehul Kapadia said AI is used to meet a broad goal that “any delivery should be done in a better way than the last one in terms of sustainability and cost, so we use AI and machine learning essentially for that.”AI at Locus uses what Kapadia called “constraints,” which inform a last-mile driver that a delivery can’t be made at a certain time of day for a particular location, or that a certain type of package requires more than one person to make the delivery. “We use our technology to essentially do a lot of the continuous learning and figure out what combination will work,” he said. “It is a decision-making tool rather than just a transport management tool.”But that’s internal.Kapadia echoed a theme that came up repeatedly in discussions: With all the technology thrown at the supply chain today, with all the venture capital money, with all the bright people and their aisles of solutions on the exhibition hall floor, with the prospect of generative AI about to ramp up the technological capabilities further, purveyors of supply chain solutions are still fighting the lowly spreadsheet.“On-the-ground operations will still take some time before we fully get in,” Kapadia conceded. “I don’t want to put a time frame on it. People and change management will be a big challenge.”More articles by John KingstonEY Americas leader: 70% of supply chain digital transformation efforts failQuiet quit a product of disengaged supply chain workforceFifteen states jump into California’s ongoing AB5 legal battleThe post AI isn’t new to the supply chain, but ChatGPT is expanding its role appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

The bottom line? Many questions; few, if any, answers.The hearing featured Altman, New York University Emeritus Professor of Psychology and Neural Science Gary Marcus, and IBM (IBM) Chief Privacy &amp; Trust Officer Christina Montgomery.Senator John Kennedy (R-La.) pressed on the practical steps that Congress can take – and Marcus and Altman obliged.""Number one, a safety review, like we use with the [Federal Drug Administration] prior to widespread deployment,"" said Marcus. ""If you're going to introduce something to 100 million people, somebody has to have their eyeballs on it... Number two, a nimble monitoring agency to follow what's going on, not just pre-review, but also post as things are out there in the world, with the authority to call things back.""Marcus added that there should also be funding focused on AI safety research and building an ""AI constitution.""For Altman's part, he also called for an AI-focused regulating entity and regulation of AI overall.""I would form a new agency that licenses any effort above a certain scale of capabilities, and can take that license away and ensure compliance with safety standards,"" he said. ""Number two, I would create a set of safety standards...We can give your office a longer list of things that we think are important there, but (there should be) specific tests a model has to pass before it can be deployed in the world.""Altman also said that it will be important to include ""independent audits"" from ""experts who can say that the model is or isn't in compliance with state and safety thresholds.""Yahoo Finance spoke to two outside experts about the hearing directly in its aftermath.Part of the reason regulation is so hard to lock down is ""the very nature of technologies like generative AI,"" said Wasim Khaled, CEO and co-founder of Blackbird.AI. When things do go wrong, facilitated by AI, it's also hard to assign blame, making regulation and accountability even trickier.Story continuesKhaled added: ""For example, if an AI system causes harm, who’s at fault? Is it the creators? The operators? The training data sources? The system itself? The consequences of getting it wrong have never been higher.”John Winner, CEO of Kizen, also weighed in, saying that the hearing was an important first step, albeit a very early one.""There are still a lot of open questions on how we ensure AI is used to advance humanity and benefit everyone,"" he said. ""With how fast AI is moving, it's great to see the involvement and commitment from leading companies and the US government to ensure this is used properly.""New models needed? OpenAI CEO Sam Altman speaks before a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law hearing on artificial intelligence, Tuesday, May 16. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)'You can create ten new agencies'The idea of an AI-specific agency received a lot of air time. But it also posed more questions and few answers. For example, IBM's Montgomery initially received pushback from Senators for her concerns that efforts to build an agency could take too long and be limited in its ability to regulate the new age of AI. One reason: a lack of proper funding and other resources, a point that some lawmakers came to her defense on.""Most of my career has been in enforcement and, I'm telling you, you can create ten new agencies, but if you don't give them the resources – I'm not just talking about dollars, I'm talking about scientific expertise –you guys will run circles around us,"" said Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), who convened the hearing. ""It isn't just the [AI models] that will run circles around [those agencies], but it's the scientists in your company. For every success story in government regulation, you can think of five failures.""Still, the government is going to need to do something – and NYU's Marcus noted that there are certain types of AI usage that are more important to regulate than others, like those in the medical world.""We have systems that hallucinate things, and they're going to hallucinate medical advice,"" Marcus told the Senators. ""Some of the advice they'll give us is good, some of it bad. We need really tight regulation around that, the same with psychiatric advice – people are using these things as kinds of ersatz therapists. I think we need to be very concerned about that.""But, the challenge for lawmakers is this: ""How?""Allie Garfinkle is a Senior Tech Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Todd Brooks, FalconStor's Chief Executive Officer; and Vincent Sita, Chief Financial Officer will discuss the company's results and activities and we'll then open the call to your questions. The company would like to advise all participants that today's discussion may contain what some consider forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in FalconStor's reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in the company's press release issued today.During today's call, there will be discussions that include non-GAAP results. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP results to GAAP has been posted on FalconStor's website at www.falconstor.com under Investor Relations. After the close of business today, FalconStor released its Q1 2023 earnings. Copies of the earnings release and supplemental financial information are available on FalconStor website at www.falconstor.com. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Todd Brooks. Todd, I believe you're on mute.Todd Brooks: Thank you, Clark. I appreciate that. And thanks for everybody for joining our call today. I appreciate you taking your time. Q1 was obviously, a very important quarter for us, as we increased our annual recurring revenue, we added new hybrid cloud customers through our partnership with IBM. We expanded our MSP business and we improved legacy customer retention. We are a trusted data protection innovator and we enable the world's most demanding managed service providers and enterprises to modernize their disaster recovery and data backup operations for the hybrid cloud world, protecting data across on-premises data centers, public cloud and private cloud environments. Migration to the cloud, data center rationalization and increased leverage of outsourced managed services are top priorities for enterprise, CIOs and are fundamental macro shifts to which, FalconStor technology in our 20-plus years of market experience are well aligned.Story continuesOur solutions deliver increased data security and provide for quick data recovery, including recovery from ransomware attacks. And our solutions accomplished these, while driving down long-term data storage footprints by up to 95%. Our hybrid cloud data protection solutions excel in four key areas: first is scalability, as our solutions enable customers to protect their mission-critical enterprise workloads; second, in offsite protection, as our customers have flexibility to leverage any storage medium from legacy tape to modern cloud-based object storage; third in cost savings, as our industry-leading patented data deduplication technology empowers our customers to decrease their backup data storage by up to 95%; and then fourth, in hardware vendor flexibility, as our solutions integrate with IBM's Power System hardware or commodity Intel-based hardware.Packaged together these advantages give our solutions competitive differentiation, especially within IBM-centric enterprise IT environments and managed service provider IT environments. We are – we talk about this almost every earnings call but we are really excited by the growth markets in which we operate and our – and those markets' ability to drive significant recurring revenue growth for FalconStor. Data protection as a service, hybrid cloud and managed IT services are growing quickly and are clear reflection of macro shifts in our industry to which FalconStor technology and experience are well aligned. In fact, the data protection as a service market is predicted to grow by 31% annually to $104 billion in 2027, the worldwide hybrid cloud market is predicted to grow by 20% annually to $204 billion in 2027 and the managed IT services market is predicted to grow by 8% annually to $355 billion in 2026.software, tehnology, laptopPhoto by Danial Igdery on UnsplashOur go-to-market focus on hybrid cloud partners like IBM and managed service providers will be key drivers for FalconStor to generate consistent and meaningful recurring revenue growth over the next several years. As mentioned during our last earnings call for fiscal year 2023, we have implemented three key strategic initiatives and we'll go through these each time during our earnings calls in 2023. First, the initiative is generating consistent recurring revenue growth by expanding our differentiated hybrid cloud, data protection leadership position for the tens of thousands of companies that operate IBM Power Systems environments. Second on, accelerating our recurring revenue growth, by extending our, IBM-centric hybrid cloud data protection position, into Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and AWS public cloud environments.And then finally, by continuing to aggressively control our operating expenses, deliver consistent profitability limit our risk, while we accelerate our hybrid cloud-focused recurring revenue base. To this point, we are excited by the hybrid cloud resell relationship we launched in late-Q2 of last year with IBM to provide several new joint solutions which combine FalconStor StorSafe VTL software with IBM Cloud Object Storage, IBM Power hardware and IBM Power Virtual Server cloud environments. And we're very happy to report that our sales continue to increase through this relationship with IBM Q1. And our customer satisfaction has remained very high with IBM customers using these solutions. And these joint solutions really fall into three categories to migrate and optimize data protection for IBM customers.And these include the following three solutions. First, an optimized backup and restore solution, where enterprise running their IBM applications on premises or in the IBM Power Virtual Server cloud can utilize our joint solution to securely and effectively back up or efficiently back up to IBM Cloud Object Storage. Second, within cloud migration solutions for enterprises needing to, migrate their existing on-premise applications to the IBM Power Virtual Server cloud our StorSafe software takes a secure snapshot and restores it to the cloud maximizing application availability and security. And then, finally, an advanced hybrid cloud backup solution for MSPs, looking to use the cloud for a secure, air-gapped offsite location. FalconStor and IBM deliver an on-premises solution with a cloud instance for secure and encrypted off-site backups.This partnership with IBM is obviously a material step forward for FalconStor and should be a significant contributor to our long-term strategic goal to significantly increase hybrid cloud recurring revenue, right. Let's move on now to our Q1 results. We have seen material recurring revenue growth since launching sales of IBM and IBM partners in the second half of last year. And that growth continued, as I mentioned in Q1, as the ARR run rate of our hybrid cloud business increased 81% compared to the previous quarter. Within that hybrid cloud, total revenue, our MSP ARR run rate increased by 23%. And clearly, we're very pleased with this continued validation this early validation of our hybrid cloud focus with IBM. But we believe that, we can increase these growth rates even further in coming quarters.As aid to this hybrid cloud growth and MSP ARR run rate growth we retained 100% of our hybrid cloud customers in the second -- in Q1 and had storage capacity used by our installed base customers increase by 0.3% on average each month. In addition to that -- to strong customer retention and installed base capacity growth, we also saw wins again across all three of our major regions the Americas, Asia Pacific and EMEA. We won 14 new hybrid cloud customers during the quarter and we have received industry recognition from IT Jungle on -- which is an IBM-centric online publication which I've actually shown a screenshot here. Clearly, I'm not going to read this, but this article and several customer references that we've received over the last couple of quarters are available on falconstor.com.And we leverage these consistently within IBM in FalconStor-related marketing material. So with that, I'm going to at this point turn it over to Vince, who will provide a more detailed overview of our Q1 2023 financial results. Vince?Vincent Sita: Thanks Clark. So if we look at the income statement, we closed Q1 of this year with $2.3 million in revenues operating expenses of $2.3 million, net operating loss of $421,000 and a net loss of $448,000. So how did this compare to prior year Q1 of 2022? So revenues represent an increase of 11%. Operating expenses were 16% lower or $400,000 lower than the previous year Q1 2022. So, as a result net operating income was $0.7 million higher in 2023 versus 2022. Net income in Q1 2023 was a net loss of $448,000 versus a net loss of $1.1 million last year Q1, 2022. If we look at our -- the balance sheet on the next page, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.8 million, compared to $2 million at December 31, 2022 compared to $3.4 million as at March 31, 2022, so therefore a decrease of $0.2 million from Q4 of 2022 and a decrease over Q1 2022 of $1.6 million.Looking at net working capital. So net working capital cash, which we exclude contract assets and deferred revenues, but include the redemption value of our term notes ended at $872,000, a decrease of $0.3 million from Q4 2022 and a decline of $0.9 million from Q1 2022. We closed the quarter with $1.8 million in accounts receivable -- accounts payable and accrued expenses of $1.7 million and deferred revenues of $5 million. So Todd, I'll turn it back to you, if you have any other final comments.Todd Brooks: Well, thanks Vince. I appreciate that. And clearly, we're encouraged by the progress that we're making with IBM and our every cloud focus. We've got a lot of work to do. We're going to clearly continue to work hard to manage our expenses make sure that we are profitable or very close to profitability every quarter. Clearly, we fell short of that a little bit in Q1. Although, we did dramatically improve our net income still was a loss for the quarter, so we've got a little bit of work to do there. But nonetheless, we're excited by the increase in hybrid cloud sales and just engagement in general with IBM and that partnership and the IBM partners. So with that, let me pause and Clark, you can open up the floor for questions.A - Clark Liddell:Todd Brooks: All right. Thanks, Clark. Once again thanks everybody for your time. I look forward to connecting again in the quarter and look forward to continue to work hard to grow this business with IBM and business in general with FalconStor. So, thanks again for taking your time and we'll talk next time.See also 25 Best Countries for Americans to Visit and Top 15 Wholesale Suppliers for Resellers in the US.]"

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this technology and consulting company have returned -3.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, which IBM falls in, has lost 3.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.IBM is expected to post earnings of $1.99 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -13.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -7.1%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.30 points to a change of +1.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.6%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.77 indicates a change of +5.1% from what IBM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.3%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, IBM is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for IBM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For IBM, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $15.48 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -0.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $61.87 billion and $64.11 billion estimates indicate +2.2% and +3.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryIBM reported revenues of $14.25 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +0.4%. EPS of $1.36 for the same period compares with $1.40 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.27 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.15%. The EPS surprise was +7.09%.Over the last four quarters, IBM surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.IBM is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about IBM. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

196,24e14e14-8bdd-3101-b2b5-07d5f9d2aac9,MPC,2023-05-17,Petrobras (PBR) Q1 Earnings Miss Estimates on Lower Oil Price,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/petrobras-pbr-q1-earnings-miss-104410848.html,1684320250,STORY,"['PETR3.SA', 'PBR-A', 'CVX', 'MPC']","[Brazil's state-run energy giant Petroleo Brasileiro S.A., or Petrobras PBR announced first-quarter earnings per ADS of $1.11, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 98 cents. The outperformance can be attributed to improving fuel sales prices.However, the bottom line deteriorated from the year-ago profit of $1.29 due to lower oil prices and production that resulted in weak upstream results, plus rising pre-salt lifting costs.Recurring net income, which strips one-time items, came in at $7,252 million compared to $8,373 million a year earlier. Petrobras’ adjusted EBITDA fell to $13,956 million from $14,961 million a year ago.The company reported revenues of $26,771 million, which decreased 1.5% from the year-earlier sales of $27,189 million and came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $26,946 million.In good news for investors, Petrobras plans to pay RMB 24.7 billion or roughly $4.94 billion in total quarterly payouts.  Petroleo Brasileiro S.A.- Petrobras Price, Consensus and EPS SurprisePetroleo Brasileiro S.A.- Petrobras Price, Consensus and EPS SurprisePetroleo Brasileiro S.A.- Petrobras price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Petroleo Brasileiro S.A.- Petrobras QuoteComing back to earnings, let's take a deeper look at the recent performances of PBR’s two main segments: Upstream (Exploration &amp; Production) and Downstream (or Refining, Transportation and Marketing).Upstream: The Rio de Janeiro-headquartered company’s average oil and gas production during the first quarter reached 2,676 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOE/d) — 80% liquids — down from 2,796 MBOE/d in the same period of 2022.Compared with the year-ago quarter, Brazilian oil and natural gas production — constituting approximately 99% of the total output — decreased 4.2% to 2,640 MBOE/d. The downside was blamed on divestments, and the shutdown of the P-18 and P-20 platforms, to go with natural field decline.In the January-to-March period, the average sales price of oil (or the average Brent crude price) dropped 19.9% from the year-earlier period to $81.27 per barrel. The decrease in crude prices, together with the dip in production, thereby had a major negative effect on upstream unit sales. Overall, the segment’s revenues fell to $15,730 million in the quarter under review from $19,684 million in the year-ago period.As far as the bottom line is concerned, an uptick in pre-salt lifting costs (which rose 9.4% from the first quarter of 2022 to $5.61 per barrel) meant that the upstream unit recorded a net income of $6,108 million, down 23.2% from first-quarter 2022 earnings of $7,954 million.Downstream (or Refining, Transportation and Marketing): Revenues from the segment totaled $24,842 million, a slight uptick from the year-ago figure of $24,685 million on higher fuel sales price. However, Petrobras' downstream unit came up with a profit of $1,199 million, which compared unfavorably with earnings of $1,938 million in the first quarter of 2022. The dip was on account of lower production volume and higher unit refining cost.Story continuesCostsDuring the period, Petrobras’ sales, general and administrative expenses were $1,578 million, 6.8% higher than the year-ago period. Selling expenses also rose from $1,178 million a year ago to $1,221 million. This led to a $418 million increase in total operating expenses.The jump in costs and lower revenues meant that PBR reported an operating income of $11,553 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared with $12,268 million a year ago.Financial PositionDuring the three months ended Mar 31, 2023, Petrobras’ capital investments and expenditures (excluding signature bonus) totaled $2,482 million compared with $1,768 million in the prior-year quarter.Importantly, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company generated a positive free cash flow for the 32nd consecutive quarter, with the metric coming in at $7,924 million compared to $7,932 million recorded in last year’s corresponding period.At the end of the first three months of 2023, Petrobras had a net debt of $37,588 million, down from $40,072 million a year ago and $41,516 million as of Dec 31, 2022. The company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $10,290 million.Meanwhile, Petrobras’ net debt to trailing 12 months EBITDA ratio improved to 0.58 from 0.81 in the previous year. It also bettered 0.63 at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022.Some Important Q1 Energy ReleasesWhile we have discussed PBR’s first-quarter results in detail, let’s take a look at some key energy releases of the January-MarchCVX period.SLB SLB, the largest oilfield contractor, announced first-quarter 2023 earnings of 63 cents per share (excluding charges and credits), which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 61 cents. SLB recorded total revenues of $7.7 billion, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.2%.SLB’s strong quarterly earnings resulted from higher stimulation services across all onshore and offshore areas. The company foresees strong activities across the globe this year. In the Northern Hemisphere, SLB expects a seasonal recovery in the second quarter with capital expansion developments in the Middle East.U.S. energy powerhouse Chevron (CVX) reported first-quarter earnings per share of $3.55, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate as well as the year-earlier quarter’s adjusted profit of $3.36 per share. The outperformance could be attributed to a higher-than-expected bottom line for the company’s downstream segment. The unit’s profit of $1.8 billion came 15.5% above the consensus mark.The company recorded $7.2 billion in cash flow from operations, compared to $8.1 billion a year ago. The decreasing cash flow could be attributed to weaker crude price realizations in the upstream business. Importantly, Chevron’s free cash flow for the quarter was $4.2 billion. Further, CVX paid $2.9 billion in dividends and bought back $3.8 billion worth of its shares.  Refining giant Marathon Petroleum MPC reported adjusted earnings per share of $6.09, which comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.74 and compared with a profit of merely $1.49 per share in the year-ago period. MPC’s bottom line was favorably impacted by the stronger-than-expected performance of its key Refining &amp; Marketing segment. Operating income of the segment totaled $3 billion, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 19.9%.In the reported quarter, Marathon Petroleum spent $690 million on capital programs (61% on Refining &amp; Marketing and 35% on the Midstream segment) compared to $573 million in the year-ago period. As of Mar 31, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $8 billion and total debt, including that of MPLX, of $27.3 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization of 45.5%.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company had reported a loss in the year-ago reported quarter. Operating revenues of $649.7 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $628.2 million and increased 29.9% on a year-over-year basis.Allegiant Travel Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Allegiant Travel Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Allegiant Travel Company Quote How is Allegiant Doing?Allegiant's operating revenues in first-quarter 2023 grew 29.9% on a year-over-year basis. Passenger revenues, which accounted for 93.7% of the top line, increased around 31.3% on a year-over-year basis. An upbeat in air-travel demand can be correlated with such an increase.Further, Allegiant's fleet modernization efforts are also encouraging. The carrier operates an all-Airbus fleet. Allegiant's fleet size at 2019-end was 91 (37 A319 and 54 A320), up from the 2018 reported figure. Despite coronavirus-related woes, the fleet size increased to 95 in 2020. ALGT exited 2022 with 121 (35 A319 and 86 A320) planes in its fleet. Fleet size at the end of 2023 is expected to expand to 127.ALGT has a strong cash position. Cash and cash equivalents of $317.6 million at the end of the first quarter of 2023 was higher than the current debt figure of $289.7 million. This implies that the company has enough cash to meet its debt burden.Despite the aforementioned tailwinds, escalating fuel prices continue to remain a concern. In the first quarter of 2023, the average fuel cost per gallon (scheduled) shot up 13.6% to $3.42. For 2023, fuel cost per gallon is now expected to be $3.00 (prior view: $3.60).

203,e5f05ca6-1f46-31ae-8fd5-855c0fd1cd5e,PNC,2023-05-17,Loan Growth Aids PNC Financial (PNC) Despite Higher Costs,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/loan-growth-aids-pnc-financial-152603108.html,1684250763,STORY,['PNC'],"[The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. PNC enjoys solid loan and deposit balances, which are expected to keep supporting financials. The company’s inorganic expansion strategies have diversified the business mix. However, elevated expenses and declining net-interest income (NII) are major headwinds. Also, PNC’s exposure to commercial loans is worrisome.PNC Financial’s total loans and deposits have witnessed a four-year (2018-2022) compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.6% and 13%, respectively. The rising trend continued sequentially in first-quarter 2023. With decent pipelines, PNC is well-poised for loan balance growth in 2023. It expects loans to rise 1-3% in 2023.The company has been active with inorganic growth moves. In September 2022, it closed the buyout of Linga, a POS and payment solutions firm, in a bid to expand corporate payment capabilities in the hospitality and restaurant industry space.The acquisition of BBVA USA customers and employees to PNC Financial's network and platforms, which was completed in June 2021, boosted its foothold as a commercial bank in all top 30 markets of the United States. Thus, the bottom line is likely to get further support if it continues to make planned investments and diversify its business mix.PNC’s capital deployment strategy is also encouraging. In the first quarter of 2023, it returned $1 billion of capital to shareholders, comprising $0.6 billion of dividends and repurchase of common shares worth $0.4 billion.Available cash balance at first-quarter 2023 end was $5.9 billion, while times interest earned ratio was 5.2. Hence with ample liquidity and earnings strength, its capital deployment activities seem sustainable and might stoke investors’ confidence in the stock in the upcoming period.In the past five years (ended 2022), the company’s NII has witnessed a CAGR of 7.6% on account of aggressive rate hikes by Federal Reserve. Going forward, higher funding costs are expected to affect NII. Such a decline in NII may impede PNC’s top-line growth. Management expects the metric to decline 2-4% sequentially in second-quarter 2023.PNC Financial’s non-interest expenses have witnessed a four-year CAGR (2018-2022) of 6.3%. The rising trend continued in first-quarter 2023. An increasing expense base on accelerated investment spend on technology is likely to continue affecting the bottom line in the near term.The majority of PNC Financial’s loan portfolio, nearly 69% as of Mar 31, comprises total commercial loans. Such a lack of diversification in the loan portfolio can be risky for PNC.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have plunged 30.7% compared with a 18.2% decline recorded by the industry over the past year.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Stocks Worth a LookA couple of better-ranked stocks from the finance space are JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

Walmart, the nation's largest retailer, reports earnings Thursday. Macy’s, Kohl's and Nordstrom post quarterly results later this month.Home Depot, the nation's largest home improvement retailer, said Tuesday that sales for the first quarter fell 4.2%, and it expects its first annual revenue decline since 2009. Also on Tuesday, U.S. data showed that Americans picked up their spending modestly last month, buoyed by a solid job market and a retreat in prices for some things. But it also revealed how Americans are barely keeping up with inflation.First-quarter net income slipped nearly 6% to $950 million, or $2.05 per share, for the three-month period ended April 29. That compares with $1.01 billion, or $2.16 per share, in the year-ago period.Sales rose 0.6% to $25.32 billion in the quarter, up from $25.17 billion in the year-ago quarter. Analysts expected earnings of $1.77 per share on $25.26 billion in sales in the latest period, according to FactSet.It's the fifth-consecutive quarter that the retailer’s profit has slipped, although it was much smaller this time. Target reported a 43% drop in profits for the fourth quarter, a 52% drop in third-quarter profits, 90% in the second quarter and a 52% decline in last year's first quarter.Target earnings per share to be in a range from $1.30 to $1.70 in the current quarter. Analysts were expecting $1.95 per share, according to FactSet. For the full year, the company is maintaining its prior guidance of $7.75 per share to $8.75 per share. Analysts are expecting $8.36 per share, according to FactSet.Story continuesTarget said theft is cutting into its bottom line and it expects related losses could be $500 million more than last year, when losses from theft were estimated to be anywhere from $700 million to $800 million. So that means losses could top $1.2 billion this year. The company said it's seeing an increasing number of violent incidents at stores as well, but does not want to close stores and is expanding security and locking up some items.Retailers are being hit with a rash of thefts and in some case, closing stores and pulling out of locations because of massive losses, some tied to criminal gangs. The issue has received more notice in the past few years as high-profile smash-and-grab retail thefts and flash mob robberies have garnered national attention.First-quarter comparable sales — or those from stores or digital channels operating for the past 12 months — were flat compared with the year-ago period. That's bit of a slowdown from the 0.7% growth in the previous quarter. Customer traffic was up. Shoppers are focused on buying necessities like groceries over non-essentials, but they still rely on Target for affordable, trendy fashions.Comparable stores sales grew 0.7% but comparable online sales declined.“We came into 2023 clear-eyed about what consumers were facing with persistent inflation and rising interest rates,” CEO Brian Cornell said during a media call Tuesday.Given this competitive environment, Target is continuing to make investments in stores and online.The discounter said in early March that it plans to invest as much as $5 billion this year expanding services for customers, including a drive-up service for returns, renovations at 175 stores and improvements in online shopping.Target's shares rose roughly 1% at the opening bell.________________Follow Anne D’Innocenzio on TwitterThis story and headline has been corrected to show that Target is predicting more than $1 billion in losses from theft this year.]"

""The fear of a looming recession weighs heavily on many American families.""The company's lackluster forecast followed bleak numbers from U.S. home improvement chain Home Depot, which warned of a steeper-than-expected drop in annual profit. Bigger rival Walmart, which gets more than half of its revenue from groceries, is set to report earnings on Thursday.""These continued signs of caution among consumers have reinforced why we entered this year with a conservative inventory position,"" CEO Brian Cornell said.Target's inventory at the end of the first quarter was 16% lower than last year, reflecting more than a 25% reduction in discretionary items, helping gross margins improve.The company's executives used the word ""cautious"" at least 13 times during the hour-long earnings call.""Target's original guidance for the year was on the conservative side ... Against that backdrop, we think Target's print is a step in the right direction,"" D.A. Davidson analyst Michael Baker said.SHOPLIFTING TO WEIGHTarget also warned theft and organized retail crime could reduce this year's profitability by more than $500 million, compared to 2022 when the inventory ""shrink"", or loss, was over the expected $650 million.Story continuesCEO Cornell called organized crime - carefully planned operations in which criminal groups steal large amounts of merchandise to resell for a profit - an ""increasingly urgent"" issue.David Klink, senior equity analyst at Huntington Private Bank, however, said he found Target's comments on retail crime ""suspicious.""""That's a huge drag to be coming from organized crime when we hadn't even heard of it before,"" said Klink, whose firm holds $24 million in Target shares.""Not that the claim is necessarily untrue, but it seems a bit of an amorphous excuse for some weakness on gross margins.""Target declined to comment further on the hit from organized crime.Huntington was hoping for stronger results as Target's first quarter is a seasonally strong period for margins, which are usually in the high-20s range, Klink said.Target's first-quarter gross margin rate came in at 26.3%, up from 25.7% a year earlier, driven by lower freight and costs, fewer markdowns and higher retail prices, but partly offset by higher inventory shrink.Target projected adjusted profit between $1.30 and $1.70 per share, below estimates of $1.93 for the current quarter and forecast comparable sales to decline in the low-single digits.""There (are) still some pain points with the consumer and they are still being cautious, which in Target's case I do think it's extremely justified going forward,"" Jessica Ramirez, senior analyst at Jane Hali and Associates.First-quarter comparable sales grew by a better-than-expected 0.7%, helped by a 0.9% increase in-store traffic, but digital sales posted a surprise drop.(Reporting by Ananya Mariam Rajesh and Aishwarya Venugopal in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Siddharth Cavale in New York; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila, Deepa Babington and Jamie Freed)]"

""We were determined to build on our guests' trust by unifying as one team to deliver affordable joy each and every day as consumers and businesses navigate a third straight year of dynamic challenges.""The impact of the various economic crosscurrents wasn't hard to spot on Target's earnings release.Target called out ""softness"" in discretionary merchandise such as apparel and home goods. Digital comparable sales dropped 3.4% from a year ago. The company repurchased none of its shares in the quarter, either.The retailer also guided second-quarter earnings to below analyst estimates, setting a cautious tone on the potential start of the key back-to-school shopping season.Cornell is staying optimistic the second half of the year brings better tidings, however.""I think the combination of the traffic we're seeing, the relationship we built with guests, the flexibility that the actions we took on inventory provides us in the back half of the year, and that great combination of new on-trend merchandise and the consistent trends we're seeing in food and beverage, household essentials, and beauty gives us a lot of confidence that we can navigate through a challenging consumer environment with the right agility and flexibility to continue to meet guest needs,"" Cornell told Yahoo Finance on the call.In its earnings release, Target estimated that inventory shrinkage — mostly the theft of merchandise — would clip profits by a whopping $500 million this year.

And with that, it’s my pleasure to turn the call over to Scott Ford, our Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer.Story continuesScott Ford: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you, Clay. It's good to be here with you all today. I'm pleased to be able to share a quick word on our first quarter operating results, update you on the two most important areas of focus for our team and '23 and share my views on our progress towards achieving the strategic goals we laid out when we went public last summer. As noted in the headline of our release net sales for the first quarter, increased 10% year-over-year on a consolidated basis, and 22% in our beverage solution segment. The most significant contributors being the 44% increase in our single serve cup volumes and the flow through of last year's coffee price rise. Clearly, we continue to work through scaling up the single serve and extract unit as capacity constraints, new physical expansions and the resulting operating efficiency challenges impacted our EBITDA pull through in the first quarter.Thankfully, these pressures are beginning to wane as we brought additional manufacturing single serve capacity online late in Q1 and we are turning on our new extract expansion in North Carolina over the next few weeks. Turning to our two key business priorities for '23. First, our team remains focused on successfully launching our new extract and ready to drink facility in Conway Arkansas. I'm pleased we remain on track with this project, with anticipated product launches beginning in the first quarter of '24 rolling through a ramp up over the remainder of the year. In addition to the timely launch to the Conway facility the second topic the team is constantly aware of is the available revenues, cost and margins of our core coffee and tea business.coffeePixabay/Public DomainSo amidst the excitement of growth, new customer relationships, new product launches, we remain ever vigilant on our price points cost, operating metrics, efficiencies and returns as this is a competitive commodity processing. Our single serve scale up effort has been tremendously challenging, due largely to equipment shortages. But we are now meeting those challenges as new machines are online and in stock levels are now back at industry leading standards. The flavors extracts and ingredients business continues to show itself as both a tremendous source of growth and as a powerful generator of leads for all of our product lines. And the Conway extract and RTD facility continues on pace with ever growing interest from an even broader customer base than we envisioned when we set out on this path.With that, I'll turn the call over to Chris. And then I'll give a quick wrap up and he and I will be glad to answer your questions. Chris.Chris Pledger: Thanks, Scott. And good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin my remarks with an overview of our first quarter results and then I'll provide an update on our 2023 outlook. As we stated from our very first earnings call, we measure our financial success based on adjusted EBITDA on both an absolute dollar basis and on our growth rate compared to prior periods. And in the first quarter of 2023 our consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $8.5 million, a decrease of approximately $2.9 million compared to the first quarter of 2022. There are three main factors driving these results. First, as mentioned on our last quarterly call, it has taken us longer and cost more in terms of equipment, labor and materials to absorb the 44% year-over-year growth in our single serve cut volumes.That said our single serve production received a major boost in the first quarter when we installed and commercialized new single serve cut machines in February and March. With the addition of these machines, we have been able to improve our customer service levels and turn our focus to delivering the efficiency improvements that come from being able to optimize our single serve platform. While we do not expect immediate earnings growth from our single serve operations in the second quarter, we remain optimistic that we should be able to drive improved financial performance from this platform over the back half of the year. In addition to the single server equipment installations in our Little Rock Arkansas facility, at the beginning of the first quarter, we transitioned our North Carolina facilities from the legacy and might I say antiquated ERP system onto the modern cloud based platform we utilize for all of our other West Rock coffee operations.This brings our entire company onto a common ERP platform that we will leverage as we expand. As a result of the conversion our risk and ground manufacturing operation was offline for approximately two weeks in early January. That downtime coupled with a gradual ramp back up to full production negatively impacted our service levels for our roasting ground coffee in January and February. The good news is that our ERP system along with the manufacturing operations tied to it North Carolina are running now as they should.Scott Ford: The net impact of the conversion downtime as well as the challenges scaling our single serve platform accounted for approximately $4 million in [indiscernible] gross profit in the quarter, which flow goes down dollar-per-dollar to adjusted EBITDA. Finally, our sustainable sourcing and traceability segment or SS&amp;T experienced the 36% decline in net sales in the first quarter of 2022. As the disruption in global supply chains brought about by the COVID pandemic normalizes and coffee roasters rose through their stockpiled buffer stocks we are not surprised to see a reduction in sales volume as SS&amp;T customers normalize their coffee inventory levels. We expect to continue to see this trend through at least the next quarter. With that in mind, let's walk through the financial results.Chris Pledger: Total company net sales for the first quarter increased 10% year-over-year to $205.4 million. Our sales growth was driven by the 44% increase in single serve-cut volumes referenced earlier and increased pricing for the past through of higher underlying green coffee prices during the quarter. This growth was partially offset by a 3% decrease in roasting ground coffee volumes and the 36% decrease in net sales in our SS&amp;T segment. Gross profit excluding the impact of mark to market adjustments decreased $4.2 million to $33.1 million due in part to higher material and production labor costs compared to the prior year quarter. The negative impacts of the production stuff are just part of the ERP conversion, and our continued efforts to absorb the 44% growth in year-over-year single serve-cut volume.These impacts on our gross profit had a floater effect on our consolidated adjusted EBITDA which as mentioned above was 8.5 million for the first quarter. On a segment basis, our beverage solution segment contributed 181.2 million of net sales for the first quarter of 2023, which represents a year-over-year growth of 22%. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was 8.4 million, compared to 10.4 million for the prior year first quarter. Turning to our SS&amp;T segment. Sales net of intersegment revenues were 24.2 million during the first quarter of 2023 a decrease of 36% compared to the first quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was breakeven compared to approximately 1 million for the prior year first quarter. With respect to our capital expenditures during the first quarter, we deployed approximately 20 million of CapEx, the majority of which was growth capital related to our Conway extract and RTD facility.These expenditures primarily consisted of infrastructure spending, and equipment payments for our glass and catalogs. In addition, we deployed $3 million to growth CapEx tied to the continued single serve capacity expansion, and our Little Rock Arkansas facility. In the first quarter of 2023, we added new single serve machine, and we expect to add additional machines in the coming quarters, which should allow us to be able to capitalize on increased customer demand, while also improving the overall efficiency of our single serve cup operations. At the quarter end, we had approximately $144 million of consolidated unrestricted cash and undrawn revolving credit commitments. Our consolidated net leverage ratio as of March 31, was 4.3 times based on LTM adjusted EBITDA.We believe we have ample access to liquidity to achieve our near term growth targets and capital expenditure needs. Despite the headwinds we experienced in the first quarter, we continue to expect adjusted EBITDA to grow between 10% and 25% for the year, which translates to a range of $66 million to $75 million and adjusted EBITDA. This guidance represents our current expectations regarding the performance of the business. However, actual results may differ materially from these estimates. With that in mind, I'll hand the call back over to Scott for some closing comments.Scott Ford: Thanks, Chris. In closing, today, I'd like to offer a word on our strategic progress. As when we went public last year, our vision, simply stated, is to achieve the attractive economics available to a scale player, serving the largest and most complex retail restaurant and CPG customers in the world of coffee. And to do that in a way that fosters fair market pricing all the way through the supply chain to our pharma partners in 35 origin countries. I remain very excited about not only what we are building and the ultimate value that we create for all of us collectively, but also about our meaningful progress along that journey at this point in time. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for questions.See also Top 20 Ballet Companies in the World and 10 Easiest Countries in Europe to Get Citizenship.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"
213,ce988ffd-c833-3abc-ab15-fd55bbc33a53,CSX,2023-05-17,3 Railroad Stocks to Watch Amid the Industry Weakness,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-railroad-stocks-watch-amid-134401823.html,1684244641,STORY,"['UNP', 'CSX', 'NSC', '^GSPC']","[Prospects of Zacks Transportation - Rail industry’s participants are being dented due to challenges like inflation-induced high interest rates, elevated fuel price and supply-chain woes. Most industry players are looking to drive their bottom line amid the headwinds through cost reduction.Despite the challenges surrounding the industry, Union Pacific Corporation UNP, CSX Corporation CSX and Norfolk Southern Corporation NSC appear better-placed to tide over the challenges.About the IndustryThe Zacks Transportation - Rail industry includes railroad operators transporting freight (such as agricultural products, industrial products, coal, intermodal, automotive, consumer products, metals and minerals), primarily across North America. These companies focus on providing logistics and supply-chain expertise services. While freight constitutes a significant chunk of revenues, some of these companies also derive a small portion of their top line from other rail-related services, including third-party railcar and locomotive repairs, routine land sales and container sales, among others. A few companies offer service to multiple production and distribution facilities. Besides locomotives, some of these companies own equipment of leased locomotives, railcars etc.Factors Relevant to the Industry's FortunesFocus on Cost Cuts to Drive the Bottom Line: The industry has been experiencing significant levels of inflation, including higher prices for labor, freight and fuel. The industry players are focusing on cost-cutting measures and making efforts to improve productivity and efficiency to mitigate high expenses and the effects of a weaker-than-expected demand scenario.Economic Uncertainty: Despite a strong performance by major indices lately, the fact remains that we are by no means out of the woods, especially with respect to inflation-related woes. The recent production cut by the OPEC+ oil cartel, which includes OPEC members plus Russia, has led to a surge in oil prices. This may aggravate inflationary pressure and result in heightened economic uncertainty and market volatility. The turmoil in the banking sector — popularly known as the engine of economic growth — also does not bode well.Story continuesWeak Freight Demand: Risks associated with an economic slowdown, geopolitical tensions and supply-chain woes dampen the prospects of stocks belonging to this industrial cohort. Due to the uncertainty, the Cass Freight Index declined 1% on a month-on-month basis in March. In fact, the index has declined month on month in six out of the last seven months. The slowdown in freight demand does not bode well for railroad operators.Zacks Industry Rank Signals Glum ProspectsThe Zacks Rail industry, housed within the broader Zacks Transportation sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #173. This rank places it in the bottom 31% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are pessimistic about this group’s earnings growth potential. The industry’s earnings estimates for 2023 have moved down 7.6% since May 2022.Despite the gloomy outlook, there are a couple of stocks worth watching in the industry. But before we present them, it is worth looking at the industry’s shareholder returns and current valuation first.Industry Lags S&amp;P 500 But Outperforms SectorOver the past year, the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry has declined 2.4% against the S&amp;P 500 composite’s gain of 3%. The broader sector has declined 3.4% in the said time frame.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationBased on the trailing 12-month price-to-book (P/B), a commonly used multiple for valuing railroad stocks, the industry is currently trading at 6.97X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 5.51X. It is also above the sector’s P/B ratio of 4.14X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 10.86X, as low as 5.69X and at the median of 8.08X.Price-to-Book Ratio 3 Stocks to Keep a Tab onAll three stocks mentioned below carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here   Union Pacific: Based in Omaha, NE, Union Pacific provides rail transportation services across the United States. Union Pacific's efforts to reward its shareholders, even in the current uncertain scenario, are impressive. In 2022, UNP bought back shares worth $6,282 million. The railroad operator paid dividends worth $3,159 million in 2022.UNP's strong free cash flow generating ability supports its shareholder-friendly activities. The uptick in overall volumes (up 2% year over year in 2002) is an added positive. Union Pacific has an encouraging track record with respect to earnings surprise, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the past four quarters (missing the mark in the other one). The average beat is 2.28%.Price and Consensus: UNPCSX: Based in Jacksonville, FL, CSX offers rail-based freight transportation services like traditional rail service, transport of intermodal containers and trailers apart from rail-to-truck transfers.CSX is trying to drive growth in this challenging environment by reducing operating expenses. Efforts to reward its shareholders also bode well. CSX has a stellar track record with respect to earnings surprise, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the past four quarters, by an average of 7.76%. Price and Consensus: CSXNorfolk Southern: We are impressed with Norfolk Southern's efforts to reward its shareholders through dividends and buybacks. In January 2023, the company's board announced a 9% uptick in its quarterly dividend payout to $1.35 per share. NSC's strong free cash flow generating ability supports NSC's shareholder-friendly activities.Norfolk Southern has an encouraging track record with respect to earnings surprise, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the past four quarters by an average of 4.66%.Price and Consensus: NSCWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

For fiscal 2023, our estimate for revenues indicates almost 10% year over year growth. Constant investments in technology are solidifying its position in the payments market.Visa reported solid fiscal Q2 results on the back of higher cross-border volumes. A shift in payments to the digital mode is a boon for Visa. Steady domestic volumes and transactions rise will aid the company in boosting its top line in the coming years. A strong cash position enables it to boost shareholder value.However, high operating expenses stress the company's margins. Ramped-up client incentives will dent the top line.

Over the years, the firm grew and expanded its client base, managing portfolios for high-net-worth individuals, institutions, and pension funds. As of May, Fisher’s real-time net worth stands at $6.7 billion.High interest rates have been a cause of worry for investors this year as interest rates reached their 16-year high. The Fed’s efforts to fight inflation have had significant impacts on the investment strategies of investors in the US. According to Fisher, Fed decisions do not have a long-term impact on the stock market’s performance. He thinks investors should follow their long-term investment strategy by avoiding short-term volatility caused by continuous interest rate hikes.Recently, Fisher Investments announced that it would relocate its corporate headquarters to Texas, following Washington’s supreme court ruling which upheld that the capital gains tax is constitutional on the state’s wealthiest residents, according to a report by Bloomberg. The firm will also increase employee transfers over time.As of the close of the first quarter of 2023, Fisher Asset Management’s portfolio was valued at nearly $165.1 billion, up from $148 billion in the preceding quarter.

Shares have benefited from investors seeking safety in areas with less economic and interest rate sensitivity. With about one third of its sales generated by blockbuster oncology drug Keytruda, the key issue for investors is the success of its large R&amp;D pipeline to replace those sales when Keytruda comes off patent in 2028. However, Merck seems to be getting little credit from investors for the 60+ programs it has in clinical development, despite having several solid and large new product opportunities.

The actual card is fairly sleek (as you can see below), as customers names are etched into an Apple titanium card. The no-fee card generated a lot of hype, as many early users were quick to post their latest card on various social media sites.The initial goal of Marcus (back in 2016) was to leverage Goldman’s wonderful name brand and build a full-service digital bank. This card was a large piece of GS’s ambitions to grow its retail banking franchise called Marcus. After 5 years, Marcus now has 14 million customers and $16 billion in loan balances. Surprisingly, Marcus now represents nearly 20% of the firm’s total revenue.We thought it would be interesting to look how the Apple Card is doing in terms of loans and exposures. With over $100 billion in assets, this has been a successful source of cheap deposits for GS. Despite having an institutional / “white shoe” brand in the investment banking and trading world, GS’s Apple Card has been a disappointment.” (Click here to read the full text)11.

MS is a leading investment bank and wealth management firm with approximately $5 trillion of client assets under management. It merged Citigroup’s Smith Barney business into its own wealth management business after the 2008 recession/financial crisis, which resulted in a more stable business model. Recent acquisitions of asset manager Eaton Vance and E-Trade provide additional stability and higher returns on capital. We believe MS has a sustainable competitive advantage due to its size and scale, global reach, strong reputation, and financial distribution capabilities. Importantly for a financial institution, it is in good financial health as key leverage ratios including common equity Tier 1 ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio, Tier 1 leverage ratio, and supplementary leverage ratio were all well above required minimums at the end of 2021.Our thesis on MS is that its wealth management business will continue to become a larger part of the overall company, which will increase overall margins and return on equity (ROE). Wealth management and asset management are less cyclical than investment banking, and often generate higher margins and provide better stability of financial results. For example, the addition of Smith Barney added significant scale and boosted wealth management operating margins from below 10% into the mid-20%s over the past several years while also increasing returns on equity. Looking ahead, we believe the company will benefit from rising asset prices and higher interest rates, should they happen over time…” (Click here to see the full text)9. Caterpillar Inc.

Here is what the firm has to say:“We trimmed Mastercard and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) to equal weights of the Portfolio. Mastercard and Visa operate as a duopoly in a large and growing market. Over the last 50 years, global personal consumer expenditures (PCE) has grown 7-9% annualized. We expect 4-5% long-term PCE growth going forward. Additionally, the shift from cash to credit continues unabated, with a total credit penetration of only approximately 50% globally.3 This shift provides Visa and Mastercard with another ~4-6% of growth. When combined with PCE, this gives both companies high-single-digit to low-double[1]digit revenue growth opportunities. This growth estimate is before accounting for growth amplifiers like the acceleration of e[1]commerce, the shift from offline to online, and additional services. Both companies enjoy extremely strong network effects that provide strong competitive advantages.We have trimmed Visa and Mastercard because their combined weight grew to over 12% of the Global Growth Portfolio because of their recent performance and to fund our increase in Amazon’s position size. We added to both positions when their prices were depressed due to cross-border transactions deteriorating materially from the pandemic. Cross-border volumes came roaring back when travel corridors reopened, and although we are several quarters removed from the cross-border nadir, Visa still grew volumes &gt;30% in 1Q23. Total cross-border volumes are now 132% of 2019 levels. At 4.5% each, both companies remain high conviction positions for Global Growth.”7.

Stocks recently featured in the blog include: McDonald's MCD, Booking Holdings BKNG and Marriott International MAR.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:Fresh Macro Data Looks Key: Global Week AheadThe Global Week Ahead holds many key macro prints.As to events?On Sunday, voters in Turkey headed to the polls to select a new President.Ahead of us, this trading week shows key deadlines:·         U.S. lawmakers race to thrash out a deal on the U.S. borrowing limit, and·         Time is short for Russia &amp; Ukraine to agree on how to keep grain exports flowingNext are Reuters five world market themes, reordered for equity traders--(1) Fresh U.S. Macro Data: Retail Sales, Industrial Production, Housing StartsA batch of key economic data will shed fresh light on whether the United States is staving off a downturn given Federal Reserve rate hikes.Tuesday's Retail Sales data will gauge the health of consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity.Retail sales fell more than expected in March, as consumers cut back on buying motor vehicles and other big-ticket items.Reports are also due on Industrial Production and Housing Starts, while the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey could also influence asset prices this week.Data on Wednesday showed annual U.S. consumer inflation slowed to below 5% in April for the first time in two years.Still, inflation remained well above the Fed's 2% target.(2) Fresh Macro Data Arrives for Europe, TooThe week ahead brings current and historic assessments of euro area economic growth, with Q1 GDP data and the influential ZEW Institute surveys of business conditions and sentiment in European powerhouse economy Germany.Story continuesEconomists polled by Reuters expect to see the ""flash"" estimate will show the euro area eked out growth of just 0.1% in the three months to March.Some economists say stagnation has continued and could result in a recession later this year.Euro area monetary indicators, such as credit demand, point to steep declines in consumption and investment. Household savings rates are rising as borrowing falls.None of this is guaranteed to dissuade the European Central Bank from continuing to raise rates, as core inflation, at +5.6% in April, remains too far above its 2.0% target to overlook.(3) Yellen in Spotlight, at the G7 Finance Minister Summit in JapanJanet Yellen has a three-pronged focus for the G7 finance ministers meeting under way in Niigata, Japan: tackling global inflation, bolstering long-term growth and redoubling support for Ukraine.But many of her colleagues may well be asking her how a potentially disastrous U.S. default can be averted.The U.S. Treasury Secretary delayed the start of her trip to devote more time to tackling the issue. However, bipartisan divides run deep, and President Joe Biden has hinted he may not even make it to Hiroshima for the G7 leaders meeting the following weekend.That would complicate a reported side summit with Japan and South Korea on strengthening security cooperation.Host nation Japan has more at stake than many in this standoff: It is the largest foreign holder of U.S. debt.(4) Turkey's Long-Time President Erdogan On the RopesPresident Tayyip Erdogan has ruled Turkey with a firm grip for more than two decades. He faced a tight race against opposition rival Kemal Kilicdaroglu when the 85-million-people strong nation voted on Sunday.Their first contest ended with neither getting 50% of the vote. A runoff happens on May 28th.Polls suggested Kilicdaroglu had a chance, as many Turks are disenchanted with Erdogan, whose unorthodox economic and monetary policy has left them with a sharp decline in living standards, battered by crippling inflation and facing a collapsing lira.There was also widespread dissatisfaction over how the government responded to a February earthquake that killed more than 50,000 people and left millions homeless.Erdogan could yet prevail given a strong support base in the devout working-class Anatolian heartland. Even if he doesn't, it's hard to envisage the feisty politician quietly bowing out of office.Whoever wins has a challenging task to get the economy back on track.(5) Russia &amp; Ukraine Must Renegotiate Grain Export DealRussia and Ukraine have until May 18th to extend the Black Sea grain deal, which last year allowed the safe passage of Ukrainian exports to help tackle a global food crisis.The two sides could extend the agreement, but Russia says it will walk unless its demands to remove obstacles to its own exports are met. The two are among the world's biggest exporters and supply some of the poorest countries.Since Russia invaded Ukraine, wheat futures have dropped by more than 50% from record highs. World food prices have cooled off and the upcoming global harvest is projected to be healthy. That suggests an interruption might not have the same impact as the initial blockade.But the price of staples such as bread remain sky-high.Bread in the European Union cost almost 20% more in March than a year ago. It's far worse in the developing world, where a larger share of household incomes are spent on food.Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY) StocksNext are 3 large-cap consumer-oriented stocks, showing Zacks Growth ratings of B.(1) McDonald's : Another shockingly high $295 sticker price is found in the currently hot Retail-Restaurants industry.The market cap is $217B.

A big post-COVID rebound.The Mainland China Industrial Production growth at +10.1% y/y for April looks very strong too. The prior read was +3.9% y/y.U.S. Retail Sales ex-Autos should be +0.5% m/m for April, after a -0.4% m/m print in March.Canada's CPI for April should be +3.7% y/y, down from +4.3% y/y in the prior month.On Wednesday, the Euro Area's core HICP consumer inflation reading for April should be +5.6% y/y, in line with the prior print at +5.6% y/y.

These upgrades are part of a multi-year redesign of its network architecture to stay ahead of exponential data usage increases, prepare for a massive 5G Ultra Wideband expansion, upgrade the technology in the network, and to pave the way for personalized customer experiences. Network upgrades in Shreveport include deploying new cell sites to extend coverage and capacity in local communities. They also include preparing for the addition of 5G service using C-band spectrum, adding more capacity on fiber optic cables to move more data through the network and adding bandwidth to the cellular network to accommodate new services like wireless internet service for homes and businesses. Specifics on the upgrades include:Verizon is deploying 5G service using Millimeter Wave (mmWave), its premium, high-band spectrum which allows for extremely fast speeds and massive capacity.  Verizon has recently added 5G using mmWave spectrum to the residential area close to Boomtown Casino Hotel, the strip mall at the intersection of Knight St and highway 3032, a residential area near the Social Security Administration Office at the intersection of Dee ST and S Pointe Pkwy and a residential area by Captain Shreve High School.Additionally, Verizon engineers built new towers providing additional 4G LTE service improving coverage and capacity at the Barksdale AFB Base which serves the base Main Exchange, Commissary, Headquarter offices, residential areas, the airfield and hangars. A second macro tower was deployed at the Intersection of Mansfield Rd and Hollywood Ave. This site improved coverage and capacity in multiple residential communities, Caddo Teachers Academy and Caddo Heights Math and Science School.Story continuesMore upgrades on the horizonLater this year, Verizon engineers will begin deploying 5G Ultra Wideband service using Verizon’s recently acquired C-band spectrum, designed to provide wide coverage for 5G service. In preparation for this massive 5G expansion, Verizon has increased the capacity on the fiber connections which are used to move data between cell sites and connect those sites to the rest of the network. With the anticipated addition of 5G service and the many additional wireless solutions 5G allows, far more data will travel on the wireless network in Shreveport, so the fiber upgrades will allow those cables to carry 10 times the amount of data.In addition to the fiber upgrades and the preparation for massive 5G expansion in the market, engineers are making preparations to enhance the service by deploying leading edge, modernized technology in the area. Engineers are upgrading the hardware in many of the cell sites providing service throughout Shreveport adding capacity for more data to be used by customers, providing power efficiency, and providing virtualization. This technology milestone allows Verizon to rapidly respond to customers’ varied latency and computing needs, and provides greater flexibility and agility in the introduction of new products and services. The move to a cloud-based, virtualized architecture with standardized interfaces in every part of the network leads to greater flexibility, faster delivery of services, greater scalability, and improved cost efficiency in networks.Shreveport, LA customers have the best experience on Verizon’s networkThe recent network upgrades have led to customers having the best experience on the Verizon network in Shreveport, LA, according to the nation’s most rigorous scientific testing company RootMetrics®.

These upgrades are part of a multi-year redesign of its network architecture to stay ahead of exponential data usage increases, upgrade the technology in the network, and to pave the way for personalized customer experiences. Network upgrades in Bakersfield include deploying new cell sites to extend coverage and capacity in local communities. They also include adding more capacity on fiber optic cables to move more data through the network and adding bandwidth to the cellular network to accommodate new services like wireless internet service for homes and businesses. Specifics on the upgrades include:Engineers in Bakersfield have been quickly deploying 5G Ultra Wideband throughout the area, deploying this service on 88% of the cell sites that serve people in this community. That coverage has been expanded recently with the addition of five new macro cell sites. Customers in the following areas are now able to experience the speed and security of 5G Ultra Wideband service.Stockdale/Buena VistaCommunity in the Riverwalk Area and well as the West of Stockdale/Buena Vista area. Improved Coverage extends to the Dignity Health Outdoor Amphitheatre, Aera Park, the park at Riverwalk and the surrounding dining and commerce area.In Northwest Bakersfield improving residential coverage throughout the Norris/Coffee communityIn the Old Farm/Reina community in NW Bakersfield improving converge to the surrounding ResidentialIn the Ackmoor Way community improving coverage to surrounding residential area, park &amp; businessesIn addition to adding more 5G service using C-band spectrum, Verizon is also deploying 5G service using Millimeter Wave (mmWave), its premium, high-band spectrum which allows for extremely fast speeds and massive capacity. Verizon has recently added small cells to provide service throughout Southwest Bakersfield, Downtown Bakersfield, and Northwest Bakersfield/Rosedale Area.Story continuesBakersfield’s exceptional 5G coverage uses a combination of mmWave spectrum and Verizon’s recently acquired C-band spectrum. Verizon engineers have been limited to using 60 MHz of C-band spectrum to deliver 5G service to customers. By the end of the year, customers in Bakersfield will be able to take advantage of even more spectrum as it becomes available for 5G Ultra Wideband. That additional bandwidth will turbo charge the service, offering significantly higher speeds, much greater capacity to accommodate more customers and more robust services.Lastly, the addition of 5G service and the many additional wireless solutions allow far more data to travel on the wireless network in Bakersfield. That exponential increase in data carried into and out of the cell sites serving the community requires upgraded fiber optic cable links.

The automaker, which is 9.87% owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc and had some 660,000 employees as of April, declined to elaborate on its autonomous driving strategy.BYD sold some 510,000 pure electric and plug-in hybrid cars in China during the first quarter, accounting for nearly 40% of sales of such vehicles and nearly four times more than Tesla Inc .Most of its cars are currently equipped with Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) developed by Bosch.By comparison, rivals like Tesla, Xpeng, Nio and Li Auto have developed their own automated driving features that are more advanced and can, for example, allow drivers to cede control of the car when on highways.Story continuesBYD has also this year teamed up with autonomous driving chip technology firms Nvidia and Horizon Robotics , saying it wanted to develop more intelligent vehicles.Nvidia's Orin, one of the world's most powerful autonomous driving computing platforms, will be used in its next-generation Dynasty and Ocean series of cars, the companies said.Both are high-volume models and further advances in BYD autonomous driving features would popularise the technology within China.Horizon Robotics' Journey 5, a lower-cost alternative to Orin, will be used in BYD's Han sedans in the second half of this year, according to one of the three sources.That will help equip the model with new features that are on par with Tesla's Navigate on Autopilot, the source added.Founded just 28 years ago in southern China, BYD has outdone rivals in electric vehicles by employing a high level of vertical integration, developing and manufacturing batteries and other key components on its own.(Reporting by Zhang Yan, Sophie Yu, Zhuzhu Cui and Brenda Goh; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)]"

The stock closing down after the retailer reported a decline in revenue and cut its full-year EPS and revenue growth projections, citing demand weakness in Q1 and expectations that the weakness will continue. Doesn't look good as we look ahead to Lowe's earnings next week.DIANE KING HALL: No, definitely. That was definitely one of the drags on the market today, Home Depot. You had also the backdrop of the weaker-than-expected retail sales numbers. You're looking at Home Depot down 2%. That knocked on Lowe's as well as investors taking-- that stock taking a hit as well, down about a percent. You also had the debt-ceiling backdrop hitting the market as well today with those talks going on. So certainly just seeing pressure across the board. Initially the NASDAQ was the outlier. But again, all three indexes falling at the close.And Home Depot just giving a cautious outlook, although their earnings were-- excuse me, revenue fell. Earnings were better than expected, but revenue missed expectations broadly. So again, just not boding well for Lowe's ahead of-- for Home Depot, biggest revenue miss in more than 20 years. Lowering its forecast for the year.You know, another stock that we're watching today, Horizon Therapeutics, that stock taking a big hit. It sinking double digits, down 14% after the FTC sued to block Amgen's acquisition of the biotech. The government says the deal would stifle competition, arguing it would deepen Horizon's monopoly on treatments for thyroid eye disease and chronic refractory gout. Now, this marks a big stake in the ground by the FTC because, Akiko, it is the first time the government has sued to stop a pharma deal since 2009.AKIKO FUJITO: Yeah, and that was a bit of the surprise there. I mean, look, if you look at FTC chair Linda Kahn, we know that she has been very clear about any kind of sort of anticompetitive behavior. They've been very cautious on any type of merger deals there.Story continuesBut so much of the focus has been on the big tech deals. At least we've been focused a lot on that as well. But when you look at what happened today, Horizon Therapeutics getting hit in a big way on the back of that report, down well over 10%.We should note a federal judge still needs to approve the injunction. So this is not a done deal by any means, but now that deal potentially in danger, and Horizon Therapeutics down more than 14% today on the news.Well, chip stock AMD is trading higher today, closing up. The stock boosted after Daniel Loeb's Third Point reported a stake of 1 million shares in the chipmaker. AMD, of course, not the only chip stock on the move today.And Nvidia also trending today on Yahoo Finance on news that it now has a larger market cap than Berkshire Hathaway. And you see the stock up about-- you know, almost 81% there, trading at $299-- $292 a share.DIANE KING HALL: But AMD had that bigger move up, 4%, and you also had some interesting comment from an analyst at Bernstein. Analyst about AMD talking about, yes, the PC market is still bad but less bad now, and then you really have to kind of compare the PC market to prepandemic. You can't use the pandemic as a frame of reference now and that things are normalizing with regard to PC shipments, so hence helping give a lift to AMD as well. So you're seeing that play out as well within that stock.]"

We'll see it in the NASDAQ when it opens up in just a moment.But all three major averages not seeing a big decline here. But nonetheless, futures have been bouncing around a little bit this morning, before, now, this lower cash open. All three averages down about a quarter too-- in the case of the Dow, about a fourth of 1%. So the focus, not just today, but all week, as we've been talking about, is going to be on the consumer.And the early indications, especially if you look at Home Depot, not great.BRAD SMITH: Yeah. Well, we're taking a look at the Dow Jones Industrial Average here. Out of the gate this morning, you're seeing that lower, as Julie mentioned, by about 4/10 of a percent. We'll round that off too. NASDAQ Composite also in the red by about a quarter of a percent.Past two days, though, still holding on to some slight gains, fractionally higher by about 4/10 of percent there. S&amp;P 500, flat-- about as flat as it gets, holding on by a hair of its chinny chin chin to the upside here over the past two days. But here, today, it's down by about a quarter of a percent. So let's take a look at the S&amp;P 500 sectors, as we always do, just to start off your trading session.11 sectors, we've got them loaded up here for you on the screen. Pulling up the caboose, consumer discretionary here. And think about some of those categories that we were talking about with regard to the retail sales data that came out this morning. Consumer discretionary, that's down 8/10 of a percent. Staples, actually, even down by about 3/4 of percent this morning.Story continuesBut look at technology. That's actually the lone gainer, the Lone Ranger in the green. It's up by about 1/10 of a percent. Speaking of technology, let's take a look at the NASDAQ 100 here. Some of those megacap tech stocks trying to put the team on its back in a sea of red.You've got some green among the largest of the companies here. Microsoft, fractional gains there out of the gate. That's up 7/10 of a percent, Google, Alphabet, Alpha Google, whatever you're calling them, call them in the green. And Nvidia, the chipmaker, you're seeing that higher by about 2/10 of a percent. Plus, 2/10 of a percent gains for Apple and Amazon, just a little bit more than that as well.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. We've yet to get those Nvidia earnings too.BRAD SMITH: Right.JULIE HYMAN: That's the last of the biggies. I think we have retailers on--BRAD SMITH: We do.JULIE HYMAN: --our heat map, somewhere there. You might need to go to a different list of them. We got a lot of heat maps. But I'm curious to-- as we get underway-- there they are. HD down 3%. Lowe's looks like it's getting pulled down too.BRAD SMITH: And look at this. Kind of previewing what we're going to be waiting for later on this week. Of course, Walmart, you're seeing that down by about 1 and 1/2% right now. Target also lower by about 2.9% on the same day as their retail sales data coming out this morning.And even into some of the dollar store retailers, those are interesting to track, especially when consumers are looking for more of those discounts, are looking for some type of deal wherever they can find one. Let's zero in, just very quickly here, on Dollar General and Dollar Tree. Dollar General, you're seeing that down by about 1.2% even, right now.And then, additionally, Dollar Tree, that's down by about 1%. So largely red across the board. Amazon, the only company on this board-- well, not the only company on this board that's already put earnings out, but one of the only retail companies on this board that we've heard from earlier on in the season--JULIE HYMAN: Yeah.BRAD SMITH: --because, well, it's a big tech company.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah.

If this was forwarded to you, sign up for Check Call the newsletter here.In this edition: Earnings season highlights, the rise in flatbed demand and Roadcheck starts Wednesday.(Image: makeameme.org)How’d the lemonade stand do? This earnings season was, well, brutal. It was the first quarter of the new year in a recessionary freight environment. No one really had high expectations for this quarter as the first few months of the year are never strong for most shippers. Turns out it might not have been ideal for carriers and 3PLs alike.The carriers: U.S. Xpress, while it is being acquired by Knight-Swift, the deal isn’t done yet. Its quarterly earnings update came with layoffs, to the tune of 150 people. The lack of freight demand is cited as the No. 1  reason for its less-than-stellar Q1 performance. The company reported an operating loss of $29.9 million and net income was a $27.1 million loss. Even enterprise carriers aren’t immune to high operating costs.In the LTL world, Yellow came out only slightly better than others. It’s still working on a new union contract with Teamsters, but that wasn’t the main drain on resources. The infamous rebrand of “One Yellow” has had some negative effects on the balance sheet to the tune of about $4 million to $6 million. Overall, Q1 took a net loss of $54.6 million. That hurts — a lot.In the 3PL world: GXO, the logistics spinoff of XPO, actually came out of the gate swinging. Its first-quarter revenue set a record of $2.3 billion, a 12% year-over-year gain. Despite setting a new record in revenue, the company did fall short in net income as that came in at $25 million, which is about $12 million short of last year’s income.C.H. Robinson performed about as well as anticipated, which wasn’t ideal. Gross profits, income from operations and diluted earnings per share were all down double-digit percentages. Shippers stuck with elevated inventory and low consumer demand were cited as the main roadblocks. The earnings per share for the quarter came in at 98 cents, which missed the mark by 3 cents. Overall, the company had revenue of $4.61 billion, which was below the target of $4.8 billion. The next quarterly call could look a little different for C.H. as the company will likely have a new CEO.Story continuesIf the Q1 calls are any indication of what it expect in the second quarter, it’s gonna be a rough first half of the year.(Image: Carthrottle.com)Everyone’s favorite topic lately is that Mexico demand has popped up again, this time in regard to its anticipated demand in flatbed freight. According to FreightWaves’ Noi Mahoney’s article, “Cross-border flatbed trucking could prove to be the most durable segment of the trucking market in 2023.” With the rise in shippers in various industries setting up manufacturing plants in Mexico, it’s going to make for some hot flatbed demand for a while. All the buildings have to be built with materials that travel on flatbeds.Not only is the demand for warehousing and manufacturing plants in Mexico strong, there is also still a strong demand for raw materials being imported to the U.S. from Mexico for housing here. The residential real estate market has cooled off significantly from where it was a year ago. The one thing that hasn’t cooled off is the demand for housing, leaving many U.S. real estate developers to invest in apartment complexes.(SONAR Ticker: AGRATE)Market Check. Memorial Day is just shy of two weeks away and that is the official start of summer. With that comes all of the amazing fruits and vegetables that make it to all the cookouts and grills across the country. Getting the produce to that party is an undertaking that those in the supply chain are quite familiar with. Based on USDA spot rates, it looks like harvest has begun its northern trek. Parts of Georgia, Tennessee and northern Arizona have begun seeing an increase in spot market rates, meaning the rest of the South will fall in line likely right around Memorial Day.(Image: Twitter)Reminder corner. We’re swapping out who’s with whom this week to give one final reminder that the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance is performing its annual roadcheck blitz across North America this week. Starting Wednesday, CVSA-certified inspectors in Canada, Mexico and the U.S. will inspect commercial motor vehicles (trucks, buses, etc.) at weight/inspection stations and other designated inspection areas.This year’s focus is on anti-lock braking systems (ABS) and cargo securement. Now more than ever, make sure carriers are taking the time before departing a shipper to properly inspect and secure their loads, especially flatbed drivers. This should be an especially handy reminder for them as they face the highest risk if something isn’t properly secured. Remind shippers this is happening this week and if they have items that need to be moved urgently, try to give as much lead time as possible to accommodate a lengthy inspection should a driver get stopped.The more you know An unusually terrible freight market may get a lot worseTruckers threaten to boycott Florida over migrant crackdownTrucking, safety groups line up against anti-speed limiter billWhen hornets wait for driversCompanies’ drive for expanding margins threatens future freight demandThe post Check Call: That lemonade stand looks rough appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

But there are some alarming wild cards that come with it, especially when it comes to the entertainment industry. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal is here to talk about what some experts are calling a Wild West scenario. Ali, what can you tell us?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, it's sort of this crazy moment right now when it comes to AI especially in the entertainment industry. And there have been many recent examples. One in particular is a song that went viral on TikTok called ""Heart On My Sleeve."" It features the AI generated voices of Drake and The Weeknd.And it's led to a lot more questions when it comes to how these companies can really protect these artists and creators. Universal Music Group, which is the label that represents Drake, The Weeknd, Ariana Grande, a lot of really big names, they have spoken at length about the dangers of generative AI, especially if it's left unchecked.The company says it's currently in talks with lawmakers and governments to try and protect and defend creators' rights. But proponents of AI says that it's a very tricky thing, because it's not like with this song and this example in particular, you are copying Drake's exact words or his song that he owns, but it's the voice.And there's no current precedent for that. On top of that is that general property belongs to the person who created it. And AI isn't a legal person. So it just adds to further complications here. And it's just an incredibly fast moving space.We've heard from Spotify CEO Daniel Ek address this as well, and it's really trying to balance, how do you leverage something like this to improve efficiencies and foster creativity, while also protecting those artists.Story continuesAKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, that specific issue we saw a rise during the testimony over in Congress today with Sam Altman being asked about that-- you're talking about the music industry specifically, but we've obviously seen the applications of artificial intelligence in other parts of the entertainment industry. What are some of the concerns there?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Well, you can look at the current writers strike that's happening in Hollywood and, really, across the country right now as another prime example of this. The Writers Guild of America, they're demanding that restrictions be placed on the use of artificial intelligence in current and future projects. So they don't want artificial intelligence to be able to be trained on source material that real people, real writers created so that technology can then go out and spit multiple episodes or even a screenplay.It's kind of nuts to think that that's a possibility. But it is right now. And it's a conversation happening on both sides of the aisle. The AMPTP, which negotiates on behalf of the studios, they've admitted that ongoing conversations are needed. We heard from Disney CEO Bob Iger, who said, overall, he's bullish on the prospect, but that it is going to lead to challenges and complications in the future.- Yeah, certainly. And we just continue to have this broad conversation about generative AI, especially with OpenAI CEO on Capitol Hill today talking about the standards that are needed to deal with things like this. So it's certainly something we'll continue to watch. Thank you so much, Ali Canal,]"

But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. Specifically, we decided to study Under Armour's  ROE in this article.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for Under Armour How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Under Armour is:19% = US$387m ÷ US$2.0b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.19 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.A Side By Side comparison of Under Armour's Earnings Growth And 19% ROETo begin with, Under Armour seems to have a respectable ROE. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 19%. Consequently, this likely laid the ground for the decent growth of 6.5% seen over the past five years by Under Armour.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Under Armour's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 14% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about Under Armour's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is Under Armour Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Given that Under Armour doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that Under Armour's performance has been quite good. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. As a result, the decent growth in its earnings is not surprising. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

Recently, CL's 50-day simple moving average broke out above its 200-day moving average; this is known as a ""golden cross.""Considered an important signifier for a bullish breakout, a golden cross is a technical chart pattern that's formed when a stock's short-term moving average breaks above a longer-term moving average; the most common crossover involves the 50-day and the 200-day, since bigger time periods tend to form stronger breakouts.Golden crosses have three key stages that investors look out for. It starts with a downtrend in a stock's price that eventually bottoms out, followed by the stock's shorter moving average crossing over its longer moving average and triggering a trend reversal. The final stage is when a stock continues the upward climb to higher prices.A golden cross contrasts with a death cross, another widely-followed chart pattern that suggests bearish momentum could be on the horizon.CL has rallied 7.1% over the past four weeks, and the company is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank at the moment. This combination indicates CL could be poised for a breakout.Once investors consider CL's positive earnings outlook for the current quarter, the bullish case only solidifies.

264,1bdcd366-2105-3dcd-a04a-c5c5960deb91,CL,2023-05-17,3 Dividend Stocks to Buy as the Consumer Sector Rebounds in 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-dividend-stocks-buy-consumer-132647133.html,1683898007,STORY,"['FUN', 'TNL', 'CL']","[The consumer sector was beaten down in 2022. That’s because many Americans began to pull back spending due to rising inflation. But there is some indication that demand remains steady. And although there is still a risk premium in equities, it can be time to think about dividend stock picks for a consumer sector rally. This morning, the latest Consumer Price Index came in slightly cooler than expected. That follows up on last week’s Federal Reserve meeting. The Fed raised rates but issued its first signal that it may be ready to pause its campaign of interest rate hikes.  In a market where the bulls and bears are playing tug-of-war, every piece of data is critical. That’s why the most critical piece may have come from the April jobs report. The takeaway from that is that Americans are still working heading into summer. And if the news gets better over the summer, this rally could gain steam. Here are three dividend stocks that are well-positioned to deliver a strong total return for a summer rally.  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCLColgate-Palmolive$81.63TNLTravel + Leisure$35.80FUNCedar Fair$43.29Colgate-Palmolive (CL) stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large text.Source: iQoncept/shutterstock.comColgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) leads off this list of dividend stock picks for a consumer sector rally. The consumer staples giant offers shareholders heads you win, tails you don’t lose scenario.  By that I mean, if the rally gets legs, Colgate-Palmolive will likely improve on its “average” 50-ish percent revenue growth over the last three years. And if the rally is just a head fake, consumers still need the company’s products.  In its most recent earnings report, Colgate-Palmolive beat on the top and bottom lines. But what was more interesting is that the numbers closely approximated the results from the prior year. At a time when many analysts continue to forecast an earnings recession, that shouldn’t be overlooked. The consumer staples stock is not cheap. It currently trades for around 42x earnings. But the company is expected to post earnings growth of over 13%. Since earnings growth is one of the strongest predictors of stock price movement, that’s bullish for investors. Story continuesAlthough CL stock is flat in 2023, it’s up over 5% in the last 12 months. And with the company’s dividend yield of 2.38%, CL stock has kept shareholders ahead of inflation. Not only that, but Colgate-Palmolive is a dividend king that raised its dividend for the 61st consecutive year in March 2023.  Travel + Leisure (TNL) A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockRevenge travel shows no signs of abating. That provides the perfect backdrop for investors to consider investing in Travel + Leisure (NYSE:TNL). The company is best known for its namesake magazine, but don’t let that fool you. This is a mid-cap stock that should benefit as travel remains the itch that consumers need to scratch. One reason that TNL stock got on my radar was the projected earnings growth that is expected to come in at 14.44%. That comes after the company beat on the top and bottom lines in its first quarter 2023 earnings report in April. Not only that, but the numbers were better on a year-over-year basis reflecting the strength of the travel sector.  Unquestionably, Travel + Leisure has been a laggard. The stock is down over 29% in the last year. But analysts give the stock a bullish 40% upside that comes with a dividend that currently has an attention-getting yield of just over 5%.  The company was listed among Newsweek’s Most Trustworthy Companies in America in 2023. The company caters to a more affluent demographic that is looking for unique experiences. With demand expected to remain strong, TNL stock is one to watch particularly with a P/E ratio of just 8x earnings.  Cedar Fair (FUN) A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comThe last stock on this list of dividend stock picks for a customer sector rally is Cedar Fair (NYSE:FUN). The company operates a portfolio of amusement parks, water parks, and hotels. The business suffered during the pandemic, but revenue soared in the second half of 2022.  That also helped the company return to profitability. And in February, Cedar Fair posted year-over-year revenue and earnings growth. That’s particularly encouraging because the first quarter is typically the company’s weakest as it’s winter in many areas in which the company does business. And Cedar Fair is already projecting record sales and adjusted EBITDA in 2023.  With interest rates expected to be higher for longer, many middle-class families will be looking for economical vacation alternatives. Analysts agree many are expecting demand for theme parks to be resilient amidst a mild recession.  The FUN stock trades at just over 9x earnings and the company is projected to grow earnings by 15% in 2023. Add in a dividend that returned in 2022 and currently yields 2.89% and you have the ingredients for one of the best dividend stocks for a consumer sector recovery.  On the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

By integrating ChatGPT with Marvis, the industry’s only virtual network assistant (VNA) driven by Mist AI, Juniper customers and partners can now easily access public-facing knowledgebase information using ground-breaking Large Language Models (LLM). In addition, new Marvis integrations with Zoom enable superior video conferencing experiences while significantly reducing troubleshooting costs. With these enhancements, plus a new Wi-Fi 6E access point, Juniper is expanding its leadership in AIOps and building upon a rich history of industry-firsts to drive real business value while minimizing IT costs.""AI is the next step in automating tasks that typically require a human IT domain expert, improving how IT teams operate the network with AI-driven tools like Marvis and its conversational interface,"" said Bob Friday, Chief AI Officer at Juniper Networks. ""Juniper Mist has always been a pioneer in utilizing proven AIOps to deliver assured user experiences from client to cloud, and with these latest LLM enhancements, Marvis will provide even more actionable knowledge and be an even more valuable member of the IT team.""Expanded Marvis Conversation Interface with ChatGPTThe Marvis VNA and its conversational interface were first introduced on June 7, 2018, as an essential part of IT, delivering proactive troubleshooting, predictive actions and exceptional insight into user experience via natural language processing and understanding (NLP/NLU). This enabled Juniper customers to easily delve into the network, user and application experiences (in real time) via simple language queries.Story continuesWith the recent launch of LLM tools like ChatGPT, Juniper has been able to expand the conversational interface (CI) capabilities of Marvis to deliver even more human-like conversational capabilities, particularly with respect to documentation and support issues. Specifically, Marvis now leverages a LLM API to respond to user queries for technical documentation and other publicly available historical knowledge base information. For example, customers can ask Marvis ""What do the Access Point LED lights mean?"" or ""List steps to configure Juniper campus fabric"" and receive an accurate and direct response in the typical ChatGPT style in addition to a list of relevant documents.Assured Video Experiences with Zoom IntegrationJuniper’s AIOps has always stood out for the quality of data that feeds a common Mist AI engine, including rich telemetry and user state information from routers, switches, firewalls and Access Points. Now Juniper has taken this even further by leveraging 3rd party user-experience data from the Zoom cloud.By joining gigabytes of user experience Zoom data with gigabytes of network feature data, Marvis now has a deep learning model that can accurately predict user experience performance, allowing Marvis to use advanced AI/ML explainability techniques to quickly identify the root cause of video conferencing problems. In addition to real-time proactive troubleshooting (and self-driving corrective actions, if possible), Marvis learns trends to quickly detect and correct anomalies as well as predict future issues. This insight gives IT teams an edge in reducing Zoom support tickets and the time to repair issues.Users can now leverage the Marvis conversational interface to easily access Zoom data insights via simple language queries, like ""What was wrong with John Smith’s Zoom call?"" or ""List users with a bad Zoom experience.""A Complete AI-driven Wi-Fi 6E PortfolioWi-Fi 6E is a new wireless standard that expands network capacity by making a larger amount of RF spectrum available in the 6 GHz range to add to the existing 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. To take full advantage of Wi-Fi 6E, Juniper is announcing a new AP24 Access Point. This 2.4 GHz/5 GHz/6 GHz tri-band capable device (dual band concurrent) supports up to 3.6Gbps throughput. It also features the standard Juniper Mist dedicated scanning radio for data collection and intelligent Radio Resource Management (RRM) capabilities to intelligently choose the best band to use. The AP24 comes in a compact 7"" by 7"" form factor and delivers exceptional performance and capabilities for cost-conscious customers. As it allows 2.4 GHz radios to be converted to 6 GHz, the AP24 is also perfect for customers looking to migrate to Wi-Fi 6E at their own pace.The AP24 complements other Wi-Fi 6E access points recently announced by Juniper, which include the AP45 (2.4 GHz/5 GHz/6 GHz quad-radio, 4x4:4SS, vBLE array) and AP34 (2.4 GHz/5 GHz/6 GHz quad-radio, 2x2:2SS, omni BLE).The Juniper Wi-Fi 6E Access Points complement the existing 2.4- and 5-GHz APs currently in the Juniper Mist portfolio, which support both 802.11ac and 802.11ax protocols. Unlike competing solutions, the Juniper Mist solution incorporates rich client insights and AIOps to deliver optimized configurations, maximum performance and optimized packet scheduling for increased capacity. This is all achieved without sacrificing performance for older 2.4- and 5-GHz clients for maximum investment protection.Supporting Quotes""LLM is the perfect complement to an existing virtual network assistant like Marvis. LLM enhances a VNA’s ability to accurately generate natural language text, particularly in more complex and nuanced scenarios. This combination improves customer experiences by providing easy to understand answers that reduce time spent looking for specific details. The combination of LLM and VNA demonstrates how these technologies are truly better together when done right.""-Maribel Lopez, Founder and Principal Analyst, Lopez Research LLCAdditional Resources:The Feed: Expanded Marvis Conversation Interface with ChatGPTBlog: What Do ChatGPT and Zoom Have in Common?

269,39d79879-70cf-33c9-8b9f-2acf29161597,JNPR,2023-05-17,3 Top-Ranked Dividend Stocks: A Smarter Way to Boost Your Retirement Income,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-top-ranked-dividend-stocks-131001238.html,1684242601,STORY,['JNPR'],"[Strange but true: seniors fear death less than running out of money in retirement.And retirees have good reason to be worried about making their assets last. People are living longer, so that money has to cover a longer period. Making matters worse, income generated using tried-and-true retirement planning approaches may not cover expenses these days. That means seniors must dip into principal to meet living expenses.The tried-and-true retirement investing approach of yesterday doesn't work today.For many years, bonds or other fixed-income assets could produce the yield needed to provide solid income for retirement needs. However, these yields have dwindled over time: 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s were around 6.50%, but today, that rate is a thing of the past, with a slim likelihood of rates making a comeback in the foreseeable future.While this yield reduction may not seem drastic, it adds up: for a $1 million investment in 10-year Treasuries, the rate drop means a difference in yield of more than $1 million.In addition to the considerable drop in bond yields, today's retirees are nervous about their future Social Security benefits. Because of certain demographic factors, it's been estimated that the funds that pay the Social Security benefits will run out of money in 2035.Unfortunately, it looks like the two traditional sources of retirement income - bonds and Social Security - may not be able to adequately meet the needs of present and future retirees. But what if there was another option that could provide a steady, reliable source of income in retirement?Invest in Dividend StocksWe feel that these dividend-paying equities - as long as they are from high-quality, low-risk issuers - can give retirement investors a smart option to replace low-yielding Treasury bonds (or other bonds).Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.Story continuesGoing beyond those familiar names, you can find excellent dividend-paying stocks by following a few guidelines. Look for companies that pay a dividend yield of around 3%, with positive annual dividend growth. The growth rate is key to help combat the effects of inflation.Here are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.Goldman Sachs (GS) is currently shelling out a dividend of $2.5 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.1%. This compares to the Financial - Investment Bank industry's yield of 0% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.76%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 25%. Check Goldman Sachs (GS) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;HSBC (HSBC) is paying out a dividend of $0.5 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 5.42% compared to the Banks - Foreign industry's yield of 4.31% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 28.23% over the past year. Check HSBC (HSBC) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $0.22 per share, Juniper Networks (JNPR) has a dividend yield of 3%. This is compared to the Wireless Equipment industry's yield of 0% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 4.76%. Check Juniper Networks (JNPR) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?The fact is that stocks, as an asset class, carry more risk than bonds. To counterbalance this, invest in superior quality dividend stocks that not only can grow over time but more significantly, can also decrease your overall portfolio volatility with respect to the broader stock market.An upside to adding dividend stocks to your retirement portfolio: they can help lessen the effects of inflation, since many dividend-paying companies (especially blue chip stocks) generally increase their dividends over time.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.If you're thinking, ""I want to invest in a dividend-focused ETF or mutual fund,"" make sure to do your homework. It's important to know that some mutual funds and specialized ETFs charge high fees, which may diminish your dividend gains or income and thwart the overall objective of this investment strategy. If you do want to invest in fund, research well to identify the best-quality dividend funds with the least charges.Bottom LineSeeking steady, consistent income through dividends can be a smart option for financial security in retirement, whether you invest in mutual funds, ETFs, or in dividend-paying stocks.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Here's a bit more of what he had to say during MoffettNathanson's telecom conference earlier today.BRIAN ROBERTS: The fact is that Bob Iger, on his earnings call last week, said that they're now back interested in general entertainment, which is no surprise. And I think it's more likely than not that-- that we go through what we've said all along, that the majority case, vast majority case, is that we'll put, they'll call, and at the beginning of next year.- And remember, guys, Disney currently owns 2/3 of Hulu, with Comcast Universal controlling the rest. Under the terms of the joint ownership agreement, Comcast could require Disney to buy out its stake in the streamer as early as January 2024, at a guaranteed minimum equity value of $27.5 billion or about $9.2 billion for that 33% stake. But Roberts saying at that conference that he thinks they're going to be able to sell it for a heck of a lot more than that.- Well, look, on the earnings call, Iger-- Disney's earnings call last week-- Iger had said that he'd had talks with Roberts, with Comcast, about that stake. And then he had said the talks were quote, ""constructive."" So it definitely sounds like this seems to be the path that they're moving forward. But in terms of timing, Comcast had thought this would happen before now.- Yeah, and then you're really looking at that 2024 date now, it seems like, from as far as what's going to happen in the future. And I just think beneficial to shareholders is what you highlight here, right, Akiko, as far as what matters moving forward for Comcast, basically saying, Hulu's a good asset. We're kind of trying to figure out what's going on with our own streaming service, Peacock. Maybe it's best for us to unload this at a high value and figure out what's going on with Peacock.Story continuesAkiko, I know you and I talk plenty about sports streaming. I couldn't believe Peacock paying $110 million for one NFL game. I mean, what is going on with Peacock?AKIKO FUJITO: That's a whole 'nother conversation.- I can't believe what's going on with Peacock.AKIKO FUJITO: But look, Ali's point here-- 27 and a half billion dollar valuation, right? I mean, that was in 2019. The expectation, at least from the comments we got from Roberts today, appears to be he thinks it could go for a lot more-- 50 million subscribers or roughly 50 million subscribers. I am curious about that price tag because you have to wonder how that sets a precedent when you look at the rest of the streaming landscape.

(NYSE:PRU) For Its Next Dividend Without Doing These Checks",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dont-buy-prudential-financial-inc-100337379.html,1684317817,STORY,['PRU'],"[Readers hoping to buy Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU) for its dividend will need to make their move shortly, as the stock is about to trade ex-dividend. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. In other words, investors can purchase Prudential Financial's shares before the 22nd of May in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 15th of June.The company's upcoming dividend is US$1.25 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$5.00 per share to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Prudential Financial has a trailing yield of 6.4% on the current share price of $78.04. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. View our latest analysis for Prudential Financial Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. An unusually high payout ratio of 373% of its profit suggests something is happening other than the usual distribution of profits to shareholders.When a company pays out a dividend that is not well covered by profits, the dividend is generally seen as more vulnerable to being cut.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with falling earnings are riskier for dividend shareholders. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. Prudential Financial's earnings per share have plummeted approximately 41% a year over the previous five years.Story continuesThe main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, Prudential Financial has lifted its dividend by approximately 12% a year on average. That's intriguing, but the combination of growing dividends despite declining earnings can typically only be achieved by paying out a larger percentage of profits. Prudential Financial is already paying out 373% of its profits, and with shrinking earnings we think it's unlikely that this dividend will grow quickly in the future.To Sum It UpHas Prudential Financial got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Earnings per share are in decline and Prudential Financial is paying out what we feel is an uncomfortably high percentage of its profit as dividends. Generally we think dividend investors should avoid businesses in this situation, as high payout ratios and declining earnings can lead to the dividend being cut. All things considered, we're not optimistic about its dividend prospects, and would be inclined to leave it on the shelf for now.With that in mind though, if the poor dividend characteristics of Prudential Financial don't faze you, it's worth being mindful of the risks involved with this business.

The yield is still above the industry average at 9.9%. See our latest analysis for Devon Energy Devon Energy Doesn't Earn Enough To Cover Its PaymentsImpressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. The last payment was quite easily covered by earnings, but it made up 106% of cash flows. While the company may be more focused on returning cash to shareholders than growing the business at this time, we think that a cash payout ratio this high might expose the dividend to being cut if the business ran into some challenges.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to fall by 31.0% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we believe the payout ratio could reach 104%, which could put the dividend under pressure if earnings don't start to improve.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityThe company has a long dividend track record, but it doesn't look great with cuts in the past. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.80 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $4.55. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 19% over that duration. Despite the rapid growth in the dividend over the past number of years, we have seen the payments go down the past as well, so that makes us cautious.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share is growing. Devon Energy has impressed us by growing EPS at 182% per year over the past five years. Devon Energy is clearly able to grow rapidly while still returning cash to shareholders, positioning it to become a strong dividend payer in the future.In SummaryOverall, the dividend looks like it may have been a bit high, which explains why it has now been cut. With cash flows lacking, it is difficult to see how the company can sustain a dividend payment. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance.

The forward-looking statements included are made only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events, except as otherwise required by law. I will now turn the call over to Robert.Story continuesRobert Hudson AlpertGood afternoon, and thank you for joining the call. I'm pleased to report that P10 delivered another excellent quarter of financial performance, meeting or exceeding all our key metrics. We are particularly proud that we were able to raise and deploy over $900 million of fee-paying AUM in the first quarter. The macroeconomic backdrop continues to be challenging. Nonetheless, we delivered double-digit growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income. Since going public in October of 2021, we've proven the value of our model by demonstrating a differentiated business characterized by durability, resiliency and predictability. Because P10 has a diverse set of strategies, we have multiple tools to achieve our organic growth plans. Shortly after our IPO, we gave guidance that we expected to raise $5 billion in fee-paying AUM over the course of 2022 and 2023. With this quarter's performance, we have raised over $4.3 billion with 3 quarters remaining to achieve our target. Last quarter, we laid out our objectives for 2023 that included double-digit revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income growth. We remain confident in our ability to skillfully navigate difficult market conditions while delivering on our objectives. Later in the call, Clark will discuss steps we are taking to strengthen our executive team as we continue to grow. Although we like to highlight our organic growth, we continue to evaluate M&amp;A opportunities in new and existing strategies domestically as well as internationally. We don't feel any pressure to do a deal, but instead want to ensure we find the right partner. As Clark likes to say, these are marriages. In the first quarter, we repurchased 100,000 shares and retained $18.9 million under our buyback program announced in December of 2022. We continue to believe our stock is undervalued, and we will be opportunistic with repurchases to take advantage of market dislocations. Finally, our Board of Directors approved a $0.01 per share or 8% increase in our annual dividend from $0.12 a share to $0.13 a share. Our stable and growing business model gives us great comfort in increasing our dividend without the concern of limiting capital flexibility to continue to reinvest in our business and achieve our goals. With that, I will now hand the call over to Fritz to share some thoughts on the fundraising and deployment environment. I'm proud of our results and appreciate the hard work of our team. Fritz?William Fritz SouderThank you, Robert. I think this quarter's fundraising and deployment performance demonstrates the attractiveness of our business model. Since 2017, we've assembled 7 premier strategies in their respective verticals, all of which focused on the middle and lower middle market. In our private equity vertical, despite headwinds, we added gross fee-paying AUM of $610 million during the quarter. While the denominator effect is still present and this continues to slow investors' decisions for allocations, we have every reason to retain our confidence, as we've been at this for over 2 decades with proven investment performance that wins and retains clients. We also believe in innovation around our verticals, identifying new ways to package our investment manufacturing for clients. One of the new products you will see in our performance table is what we call Multi-Strat within private equity. It is a combination fund that blends our primary fund to funds with secondaries and co-invest. The result is a product that shortens the J-Curve and has the opportunity to deliver strong returns. In the first quarter, we launched Multi-Strat II and is off to a good start with over $64 million in capital raised. RCP's Secondary Fund IV is also seeing good demand, and we've now raised almost $600 million. In our venture equity business, we believe we benefit from a flight to quality. There appears to be enthusiasm for venture equity with institutional investors, as high-quality managers continue to grow and raise capital. In fact, according to a venture capital journal survey, roughly 80% of institutional investors intend to maintain or increase their exposure to the venture asset class in 2023. Although fundraising is happening more slowly because of market uncertainty, it is happening nonetheless, and we think the current market plays to our strength with a long track record of excellent investment performance in a variety of market cycles, we are optimistic. In the quarter, we added $144 million in gross fee paying AUM spread across several products. Turning to our credit fleet. We continue to feel the wind at our backs. Hark, our NAV lending strategy has never been busier as the product is becoming more acceptable by GPs as a viable financing alternative. Deal flow is extraordinary as PE firms need more time and capital to achieve success in a market where exits are challenging. We believe NAV lending is rapidly becoming an established asset class, and we're in the right place at the right time. For WTI, we're seeing excellent deal flow as a result of the Silicon Valley Bank exiting the market. Clark will speak more about this in a moment. Overall, the credit part of our business added $68 million of gross fee-paying AUM, and we are excited about our market position, as banks go risk off and prepare for more regulations. We also see the potential for improved returns as a result of favorable market conditions. Turning to our Impact business. It continues to grow with secular tailwinds driving small business lending, climate finance and impact real estate. In the first quarter, the team added $89 million in gross fee-paying AUM. I'm proud of the efforts from all of our strategies, and it is exciting to see success across a wide range of investment products and strategies. I will now turn the call over to Clark.C. Clark WebbThank you, Fritz. I too have confidence in our ability to maneuver through what has become a challenging set of macroeconomic forces, including the recent upheaval in the banking sector broadly and SVB in particular. For much of the recent past, SVB was our largest competitor in venture debt. Their failure, combined with the pullback we're seeing from smaller banks, has created exceptionally favorable market conditions for our venture debt solution. WTI has been operating for over 40 years and has a business model that is time tested across market cycles. Our portfolio companies are in good condition and our pipeline of new high-quality opportunities is robust. We are working on WTI's Fund XI and hope to see strong demand, as we plan to launch early next year. We like the WTI strategy as it combines a 40-year loss record that mirrors high-yield bonds with the ability to produce private equity-like returns. In other words, liquid high-yield credit risk alongside private equity-like returns. We look forward to telling the WTI narrative to our clients over the coming quarters. Despite a challenging global picture, we believe P10 is positioned to prosper with investment strategies that have performed well over decades. Looking back when we went public 18 months ago, we laid out an intermediate 24-month target to raise $5 billion in new gross fee-paying assets under management. At that time, on a base of $17.3 billion, committing to a $5 billion target was no small ambition. Few would have envisioned what the ensuing 15 months would bring, with a global war, a record rise in interest rates, a 30% drop in the Russell 3000 and multiple bank failures. Despite these conditions and with 9 months left to go, we are already standing today at $4.3 billion raised across our platform. And as Robert mentioned earlier, we expect to exceed our $5 billion target. This is quite an accomplishment, and we would like to publicly commend our team and thank them for their outstanding performance. But even with our success, we continue to believe that cross-sell across P10 is in its mere infancy, and we intend to continue investing in P10 marketing in the coming quarters. As part of that process and as we lay the groundwork for our next intermediate fundraising target in 2024 and beyond, Jeff Gehl, our Head of P10 Fundraising, notified us of his decision to retire from his formal role at P10 after an incredible 22-year career. Jeff co-founded our private equity solution over 2 decades ago, and his contribution to P10 has been invaluable. Jeff is a large P10 shareholder, a large investor across P10 funds and a large owner of carried interest. While his retirement marks the end of his executive leadership with the firm and concludes his tenure in a formal role with P10, his allegiance to and support of P10 is expected to endure, and we're hopeful he'll find ways to be helpful to P10 in a new informal way in the future. As a result, we are actively searching with the help of a professional firm to bolster the P10 executive team with a specific focus around fundraising and raising the P10 profile globally. We believe our investment manufacturing is second to none across asset classes and high demand. In short, we expect significant interest from outside parties. Jeff, on behalf of the P10 family, we want to thank you for your continued support at P10, and we wish you and your family all the best. With that, let me hand the call over to Amanda.Amanda Nethery CoussensThank you, Clark. Fee-paying assets under management were $21.6 billion, a 23% increase on a year-over-year basis. In the first quarter, $911 million of fundraising and capital deployment was offset by $516 million in step downs in expiration. Most of the expirations during the quarter related to WTI Fund VII, which stopped charging fees on $362 million of fee-paying AUM. For the remainder of 2023, we expect $830 million in additional step-downs in expirations. Step-downs in expirations are a normal part of our business and typically takes place at the end of a fund's life or when a fund has reduced fees after a period of full fees. Revenue in the first quarter was $57 million, a 32% increase over the first quarter of 2022. Average fee rate in the quarter was 106 basis points, driven by continued expansion of our direct strategies, such as WTI, Bonaccord, Hark. Operating expenses in the first quarter were $52 million, a 65% increase over the same period a year ago. The increase is primarily attributable to additional compensation, benefits and noncash stock-based compensation expense related to the acquisitions of WTI, Bonaccord and Hark. GAAP net income in the quarter was $769,000. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was $28.4 million, a 27% increase over what we reported in the first quarter of 2022. As we have discussed on prior calls, the acquisition of WTI brought a higher average fee rate and a lower operating margin. Moreover, we continue to generate strong growth in our direct strategies, which share a similar financial profile. Ultimately, this should lead to more revenue and adjusted EBITDA dollars with margins in the low 50% range on an annual basis. For the first quarter, adjusted net income or ANI, was $25.5 million, a 14% increase over the $22 million reported in the first quarter of 2022. We continue to efficiently convert $1 of adjusted EBITDA to adjusted net income due to small amounts of capital expenditures, cash interest and minimal tax leakage due to our tax assets. As a reminder, our tax assets are composed of 2 distinct assets, a $177 million net operating loss and $388 million in tax amortization. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the first quarter were $25 million. At quarter end, we had an outstanding debt balance of $275 million and $98 million available on the current credit facility. Since quarter end, we paid down an additional $12.9 million of debt. In the first quarter, we repurchased 100,000 shares of stock at an average price of $8.51 per share. We had $18.9 million available under the buyback program for additional repurchases. We also continue to pay our quarterly dividend. As Robert mentioned, we are increasing our annual dividend by 8%, taking the dividend from $0.12 per share to $0.13 per share annually. We declared a dividend of $0.0325 per share on May 15, 2023, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 30, 2023, and payable on June 20, 2023. Finally, at March 31, 2023, our Class A shares outstanding were 43,088,962 and Class B shares outstanding were 72,831,689 shares. Finally, as Robert noted, we reaffirm our guidance and continue to expect double-digit growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income for the calendar year 2023, all the while achieving our $5 billion group fee-paying AUM fundraising target. We believe this puts us in a distinct class among our peers, showing strong growth in the face of a difficult market environment. We also expect to lay out our next intermediate fundraising targets for 2024 and 2025, alongside our Q4 earnings call early next year. I will now pass the call back to Robert for closing remarks.Robert Hudson AlpertThank you, Amanda. Now let's turn it over to the operator for a few questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) The first question is from the line of Kenneth Worthington with JPMorgan.Kenneth Brooks WorthingtonMaybe first on Hark and WTI, as we think about the banking crisis, how are the opportunities playing out in terms of both deployment as well as getting the message to investment clients? So in terms of deployment, what sort of lead time is needed for Hark and WTI to reach the maximum deployment from the benefit from the banking crisis? And then in terms of fundraising, how is the message on the opportunities from the banking crisis sort of being received by your investors? And does the retirement of Jeff Gehl impact your ability to capitalize here?C. Clark WebbKen, those are great questions. And it's one question, which is impressive. So we'll take each one...Kenneth Brooks WorthingtonAnd in 1 breath. I didn't breath the entire time, sorry.C. Clark WebbThe express version, I love that, yes. So let's take it. So Hark is lending to private equity GPs who have a lower middle market private equity fund. They have deployed most of the capital in that fund. They are not ready to harvest those investments and they would like to raise additional capital to make add-on investments or to play defense. This environment is perfect for that kind of capital stack and because we are focused on the lower middle market, there are not a whole lot of players that are sourcing the way we source and doing what we do. We would occasionally see a bank in the competitive arena. I would say that was occasional. I think that's probably going to be even less occasional than it was. But right now, our pipeline is as full as it's been. And as you said, the key really is bringing in more LP dollars relative to the deployment of capital. Our Fund IV, you can see in the table, I think we've closed on just over $300 million of capital, of which $100 million has been deployed. So we do have dry powder there. We also have a capital call line facility, but that is an open fund, and we are actively spreading the message because it is a very unique risk-adjusted return with investment-grade type risk yet generating a low double-digit to mid-teens type return. So that's the opportunity there. On the WTI side, SVB was the primary competitor, and we believe that, that has been a -- that's a structural shift in the market. We are still deploying Fund X. The pipeline has expanded since SVB's downturn. And so we are actively getting everything ready for Fund XI. If you think about what WTI does, they are deploying capital across hundreds of portfolio companies per fund. And so we are constantly drinking from a fire hose. It's one of the reasons why we think we do something that most people can't do. It is hard to populate a fund with a few hundred positions and do it well. And as I think we talked about in last quarter's call, this is a 40-year track record that has a loss rate that literally mirrors high-yield credit. So we're very excited about that fund. It is early days on getting the message out. We're still getting all the documents ready. We are on pace for an early next year launch, and we do believe that there is real front end demand. As it relates to fundraising, first of all, Jeff was -- I mean, he cofounded our private equity solution in 2001. He has had an extraordinary 22-year career. We owe him nothing but thanks for all that he's done on behalf of P10. We love the alignment that the P10 model brings. Jeff is a large shareholder. Jeff has a lot of accrued carry that would be paid out over the next 10 years. These are not hedge funds, these are long-term locked-up vehicles. And Jeff is a large owner of LP interest in the funds because as you guys know, we -- the P10 does not seed the funds in terms of GP commit, it comes from the operating partners. So Jeff has a ton of financial reasons to continue to help us. I was on a fundraising call with him today. So we think he will continue to be helpful, but as we talk about our next intermediate fundraising target, again, we went public, we laid out a $5 billion target. We are $4.3 billion of the way there in 5 quarters, and that's despite a macro environment that is quite difficult. As we look to the next iteration of our intermediate fundraising goals for 2024 and 2025, and we're prepping for that, Jeff, and we all agreed that it was the right step. He had laid a great foundation, let's bring some other folks in and continue to plant seeds. So we wish him all the best. He is a friend of the firm, and we think this is a net win for Jeff and also a win for P10.Kenneth Brooks WorthingtonGreat. And then I guess, a quicker one. You have a $5 billion target for '22 and '23, you're $4.3 billion so far. To get $5 billion -- to get to just $5 billion, it would suggest a pretty big slowdown in the next 3 quarters. Should we feel confident that the pace that you've been raising can continue and that your target of $5 billion is pretty conservative? Or should we really expect a big slowdown?C. Clark WebbSo I wouldn't read anything into the comment other than we do expect to exceed the $5 billion target. When you look at -- I think we said in the script, we had roughly a dozen funds in the market. And these are lots of -- we have a Fund XVIII in the market. We talked about a Fund XI that we think will be coming to market. We've got Fund IVs, Fund Vs, Fund VIIIs. These are funds that have a lot of re-up and are well known in the market. And so we really don't think about our business in terms of quarterly fundraising. We think of it as an engine that is constantly going to the next iteration of a flagship series that's been very successful over 10, 15 and 20 years. We feel really good about our business, but we also recognize that there are headwinds out there. I think our view is we've got a great slugging percentage, if we can increase the number of it fast, when we go sit in front of LP, there are not a lot of folks that offer what we offer, and we do believe that our 20-year track records are second to none. So we recognize it's a tough macro environment out there. We continue to put up results. We are going to be investing in the marketing engine because we think we've got a great story to tell. And we'll see when the money comes in, whether it's Q2, Q3, Q4, but we do believe that it is business as usual at P10.OperatorThe next question is from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.Michael J. CyprysMaybe just to dig a little further into the bank retrenching. I guess, how would you sort of size the opportunity? How much capacity would you say you have within your investment strategy? And how much bigger could those strategies be in 3 or 5 years' time as banks pullback? And then the second part to that question would be, clearly, the banks also provide lending into parts of your business so maybe you can remind us where and to what extent you guys borrow from the banks and parts of your business? And how do you navigate to what extent banks will be retrenching from pulling back from the sponsors?C. Clark WebbYes, great questions. I'll start and then others feel free to jump in. There are 4 buckets within P10 that I would argue are benefiting from what's going on in the bank retrenchment. We talked about our NAV lending franchise. We talked about venture debt, and we do believe both of those are significant beneficiaries in Impact credit because we are in the lower middle market, and we are doing things like climate finance, Impact real estate and small business lending to women and minority-owned businesses. We do believe that, that is a direct beneficiary of the banking pullback. And then we do have an SBIC credit fund where our primary competition is actually -- are actually banks. So we have 4 business lines that are direct beneficiaries of the banking pullback, the question on how big could it be? I think we'd rather see as opposed to project. All 4 are humming. They are getting bigger by the day. And we actually do believe there's a great narrative around it. I think the real determinant on how big those can be or how well we deliver the message of what we do to prospects around the world because it does feel like there's a good runway. It's incumbent upon us to get the message out. And that's why we're talking about investing in our marketing engine because we do believe these verticals, the things I'm talking about, most institutional GPs do not have these kinds of products. And so we think it's a unique message. On the leverage part, it's actually -- I think it highlights our benefit in the lower middle market. Our average portfolio company in private equity is levered at 3 to 3.5x. That's a far cry from what we read about in the larger part of the market, where leverage can be double that or more. We think that actually provides a great ballast when you have rate rises and when you have a downturn in the economy. The other thing is because we are North American-focused in lower middle market businesses, we can really focus on [seems] of growth, structural changes within a large domestic economy. We don't have as much macro risk. I would argue from things that are going on in Europe or Asia or whatever it might be. So we actually think that the business, you can look at our 20-plus year track record across private equity, and you can see how we do through cycles, but it's pretty consistent. And then in venture equity, there's really not a lot of debt used. And if there is debt used, that's in our venture debt platform. So we don't feel like we have the same kind of exposure on the venture equity side that your question pertains to. On GP stakes, we have a very diversified portfolio. We -- if you think about Fund I and Fund II, we are in private equity, we are in private credit, we're in real estate, and we're in infrastructure. And so we think we've got as many pluses as we might have minuses. And we're with great GPs. And again, we feel like this is a very rare group of folks, who can even do a deal like this. So I would say across the board, in times of stress, a model like this should shine, and I think Q1 is an indication of that.Michael J. CyprysAnd just to follow up there on those 4 buckets, I think you mentioned areas where you guys could benefit from bank retrenchment at lending, venture debt, the Impact credit and the SBIC credit strategy. Can you just maybe quantify what sort of pace of deployment you guys have been putting capital out against like over the last 12 months? Any sort of commentary, color on how those pipelines look today? How do you sort of expect that to trend? And if you're successful, would you be surprised if that deployment could triple or quadruple in, call it, 3 or 5 years' time?C. Clark WebbYes. The pipelines are as robust as they've been. That is both structural and cyclical. I think that looking at our published financials is probably the closest that you'll get in terms of incremental growth, but it is -- if you put all 4 together, it is certainly in the billions of dollars in terms of. Whether it can triple or quadruple, we would say the market opportunity is there. It's incumbent upon us to get the message out and raise the capital behind it. But we're -- every day we're in the market, and we think we have something unique to offer.OperatorNext question is from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.Christoph M. KotowskiAmanda, you were going just a little fast on all your guidance. I wonder just -- I missed the amount of the step-downs coming at us for the remainder of the year. And I was wondering also, did it have any implications for fee rate because fee rate was a little higher this quarter than I thought. And then I was also wondering if there are still any further merger costs or earnouts to be to be recognized in either '23 or early '24, from the acquisitions that have already been closed?Amanda Nethery CoussensOkay, yes. The additional step downs were $830 million for the year, step downs in exploration.Christoph M. KotowskiOkay. And does that have any effect -- come on. I was just -- what should we expect from fee rates? Does that impact it? And then also the -- your guidance on the EBITDA margin, I think you said this time, low 50s or previously, it was 51% to 52% million. Is that new or different?Amanda Nethery CoussensRight. No change on margin. So we're still expecting 51% to 52%. That's correct.C. Clark WebbAnd then on the fee rate, yes, there was -- I think we've guided to 105 basis points for the year. Obviously, we're trying to give you a specific number, but as I think we noted, we've got a dozen funds in the market, and some have fee rates well north. Not many have any well south, but we guided to 105 basis points on the year. There was a large roll off of an old WTI fund in Q1. That was baked into the guidance when we purchased WTI, when we talked about what their contribution would be in calendar year 2023. So we're sticking to the 51% to 52%. We are sticking to the 105 basis points of an average fee rate. And in terms of future earn-outs, we do have the potential earnout of WTI flowing through this number. I think you can read what that hurdle is, but it's a very [early hit ahead] and ruling for that current quarter and future, even though it hasn't been hit yet, but we think it's a win for everybody if and when that's hit.Amanda Nethery CoussensAnd, Chris, sorry, just to add to Clark's comments, the earnout is shown on our adjustments page, on a reconciliation. So you should be able to see the impact of that at earnout related compensation. And we actually will not end, we will continue, Chris.OperatorYour question, the next question is from the line of Ben Budish with Barclays.Benjamin Elliot BudishClark, you talked about cross-sell sort of being in its early infancy and that you expect to keep investing a lot in marketing. Can you maybe talk salesforce productivity and sort of how that's evolved over the last couple of years? And how much more do you think is there to go? What are the sort of step function changes that we might see over the next couple of years as the efforts you're kind of putting in start to pay off?C. Clark WebbYes. Great question. So I would say that the beautiful thing about our 20-year track records that are, we think, second to none, is the re-up rate is very high. And so we hold on to most of the capital that comes into the funds, which just gives us a lot of confidence as we launch the next vintage. And we're also always giving money back to LPs at a good return. So I think the core fundamental basis of P10 is we've got great verticals with high re-up rates. As we look at our LP base, I think we've said publicly, fundraising, it really is a barbell. They're the large LPs on one end, and then there's retail on the other. Those are the 2 deepest pools. And then there is the skinny part of the barbell, which is the endowment foundation, family office, small pensions. We actually think we do really well on the skinny part of the barbell, and we are focused on planting our flags in the deeper parts of the pool. On both cases, those are long sales cycles, and that's without a cyclical downturn. And so we are out trying to tell our story to the large pools of capital and retail platforms, as we do believe if we can get our products and our returns in front of them that it will be hard to say no. We have invested in the P10 team. I think you saw a year ago, we made a strategic hire internationally in the Middle East, and that's a seed that we planted 12 months ago, and we do think that's going to start bearing fruit here in the next 6 to 12 months, and we are looking at planning additional flags. The ramp is a 12- to 24-month ramp. So nothing we do today is presumably going to move the needle for a while, but we are benefiting from the seeds we planted 12 and 24 months ago. And then there's also just the plain and simple cross-sell. We've got 3,300 LPs around the firm. A lot of these are $3 million, $4 million, $5 million type LPs, and they love one of our verticals. And as we have additional verticals come to market, we are gingerly trying to introduce them to our other verticals. We do track that number internally. It is in the hundreds of millions of dollars of cross-sell. But as we noted in the script, we think that we're in the bottom of the first inning. We think there's a long way to go. And it's one of the reasons why we are focused on building out the marketing function within P10. It's -- we believe we have something very unique. And the more at bats we get, we think that, that will benefit the firm over the long term.Benjamin Elliot BudishGreat. And then a follow-up. It looks like a lot of the fund families are scaling pretty nicely, but I wanted to ask about RCP advisers. It looks like the most recent fund is kind of a bit smaller than the predecessor fund. So I'm wondering if there's any kind of color you can share. How should we think about like the longer-term trajectory of kind of the core fund-to-funds offering from RCP?William Fritz SouderYes. This is Fritz. I can handle that. You're correct, the Fund XVII was a little bit smaller than the other funds. Most of that has to do, though, with this launching of a Multi-Strat fund, which, as we talked about, includes the primary funds. And what you're seeing is a lot of sort of line item consolidation is what I call it, in the LP universe in wanting to have one fund that will give them primary, secondary and co-investment. So you're not actually seeing the number of investors investing in our primary funds go down, you're just seeing them now spread out into 2 different vehicles. And I think that will continue. We're seeing a lot of interest in the marketplace as we're in with Multi-Strat II and we're in with primary Fund XVIII. We are seeing a lot of interest now in this multi-strategy vehicles.OperatorThe next question is from the line of John Campbell with Stephens Inc.John Robert CampbellAmanda, on the catch-up fees, I think I might have missed that, but on my math I was getting to a little over $3 million. Is that right?Amanda Nethery CoussensYes, that's correct.John Robert CampbellOkay. And then when you guys talk to the 105 fee rate this year, is that on an adjusted basis, basically excluding the catch-up fees?C. Clark WebbThat includes the catch-up fees.John Robert CampbellThat does include the catch-up fees. Okay. And then on the step downs in exploration, Amanda, I think you said $830 million for the balance of the year. Any rough sense for the timing or roughly how that's going to phase throughout the year?Amanda Nethery CoussensMost of that will actually be next quarter.John Robert CampbellOkay. Majority of it in next quarter. Okay. And then last one for me, just another housekeeping. On earn-outs. As those are paid, I guess, particularly for WTI, that's adding support to your tax assets. Is that right?C. Clark WebbYes, that's right. So the earn-out -- we're accruing for it. It is not being paid. And again, I'd refer to the 8-K when we signed the deal on the EBITDA threshold, where that earnout is actually paid out. And yes, as that's paid, that will add to the tax asset. And so that will be a win for P10 long term, not only in the EBITDA we get, but also in the tax shield.OperatorThe next question is from the line of Adam Beatty with UBS.Adam Quincy BeattyFirst, just a quick follow-up on the fee step downs. I think the full year guide on that may have gone up a little bit. So just curious what might be moving around there. And also wondering whether additional step-down suggests potentially a faster cadence toward the next round of vintages. So has anything done -- happened to accelerate the overall fund rollout process?C. Clark WebbYes, there is no change in the step down guidance. We're obviously trying to fine-tune a couple of dozen funds. And so it may be plus or minus by a couple of dozen million, but it's very much in line with the original forecast. As for the cadence of when the new funds are launched, that with the exception of a few of the ones we've talked about, the cadence is almost annually or biannually. So I wouldn't say that anything has been accelerated other than some of the specific opportunities within credit, where we see an opportunity either to raise sooner or to raise more. Obviously, that will be incumbent upon us to go do it. But apart from some of those credit strategies that are opportunistic, it is very much in line with the original forecast.Amanda Nethery CoussensFor the large part...Adam Quincy BeattySorry, Amanda?Amanda Nethery CoussensI was just going to say that a large part of the step downs in expirations in this quarter was related to -- specifically to a WTI fund. And so that may be part of the -- yes.Adam Quincy BeattyOkay. Okay. I appreciate it. And then I just wanted to turn t Enhanced and the Impact franchise and just get the latest on what you're seeing around potential regulatory and law making tailwinds there? And how -- what kind of time line we should think about in terms of some of the newer legislation feeding through to deployment opportunities?C. Clark WebbYes. No, Adam, it's a great -- it's one of the few verticals where regulation really is a tailwind. The Inflation Reduction Act was a structural shift and improvement in the underlying business. But we're still waiting for some additional rulemaking around that, just to clarify exactly what some of the tax equity components are going to look like. But we have definitely seen a greasing of the skids with respect to things like solar finance and impact real estate. And we are certainly seeing it in our backlog in our pipeline and the opportunities that we see. Again, that was before the banking crisis. When you think about our small business vertical, we are the counter to what banks normally provide. So we've had the additional cyclical benefit of the banking retrenchment, but we feel great about the opportunity to deploy impact credit across all 3 of our verticals. And I should say, generating very good returns, but also generating real impact. There is no white washing in terms of what we're doing. The key for us is going to be continuing to go and raise additional capital to get that done.OperatorThank you for your question. There are no additional questions waiting at this time. So I'll pass the conference back to Robert for any closing remarks.Robert Hudson AlpertWell, thank you. Thank you, everyone, for joining us, and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter and call if you have any questions. Thanks.OperatorThat concludes the conference call.

The firm emphasizes the importance of analyzing market trends and using quantitative methods to identify potential investment opportunities. In addition to this, the hedge fund also provides personalized investment advice to individual clients. Over the years, the firm grew and expanded its client base, managing portfolios for high-net-worth individuals, institutions, and pension funds. As of May, Fisher’s real-time net worth stands at $6.7 billion.High interest rates have been a cause of worry for investors this year as interest rates reached their 16-year high. The Fed’s efforts to fight inflation have had significant impacts on the investment strategies of investors in the US. According to Fisher, Fed decisions do not have a long-term impact on the stock market’s performance. He thinks investors should follow their long-term investment strategy by avoiding short-term volatility caused by continuous interest rate hikes.Recently, Fisher Investments announced that it would relocate its corporate headquarters to Texas, following Washington’s supreme court ruling which upheld that the capital gains tax is constitutional on the state’s wealthiest residents, according to a report by Bloomberg. The firm will also increase employee transfers over time.As of the close of the first quarter of 2023, Fisher Asset Management’s portfolio was valued at nearly $165.1 billion, up from $148 billion in the preceding quarter.

Shares have benefited from investors seeking safety in areas with less economic and interest rate sensitivity. With about one third of its sales generated by blockbuster oncology drug Keytruda, the key issue for investors is the success of its large R&amp;D pipeline to replace those sales when Keytruda comes off patent in 2028. However, Merck seems to be getting little credit from investors for the 60+ programs it has in clinical development, despite having several solid and large new product opportunities.

(NYSE:GS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Back in 2019, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) made a splash in the card industry by working with Apple and MasterCard on a credit card. The actual card is fairly sleek (as you can see below), as customers names are etched into an Apple titanium card. The no-fee card generated a lot of hype, as many early users were quick to post their latest card on various social media sites.The initial goal of Marcus (back in 2016) was to leverage Goldman’s wonderful name brand and build a full-service digital bank. This card was a large piece of GS’s ambitions to grow its retail banking franchise called Marcus. After 5 years, Marcus now has 14 million customers and $16 billion in loan balances. Surprisingly, Marcus now represents nearly 20% of the firm’s total revenue.We thought it would be interesting to look how the Apple Card is doing in terms of loans and exposures. With over $100 billion in assets, this has been a successful source of cheap deposits for GS. Despite having an institutional / “white shoe” brand in the investment banking and trading world, GS’s Apple Card has been a disappointment.” (Click here to read the full text)11.

During Q1 2023, his hedge fund boosted its position in the company by 2%, and its total MS stakes amounted to nearly $1.7 billion at the end of the quarter.

Among these hedge funds, Eagle Capital Management was the company's leading stakeholder in Q4.Here is what Madison Dividend Income Fund has to say about Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“This quarter we are highlighting Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) as a relative yield example in the Financial sector. MS is a leading investment bank and wealth management firm with approximately $5 trillion of client assets under management. It merged Citigroup’s Smith Barney business into its own wealth management business after the 2008 recession/financial crisis, which resulted in a more stable business model. Recent acquisitions of asset manager Eaton Vance and E-Trade provide additional stability and higher returns on capital. We believe MS has a sustainable competitive advantage due to its size and scale, global reach, strong reputation, and financial distribution capabilities. Importantly for a financial institution, it is in good financial health as key leverage ratios including common equity Tier 1 ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio, Tier 1 leverage ratio, and supplementary leverage ratio were all well above required minimums at the end of 2021.Our thesis on MS is that its wealth management business will continue to become a larger part of the overall company, which will increase overall margins and return on equity (ROE). Wealth management and asset management are less cyclical than investment banking, and often generate higher margins and provide better stability of financial results. For example, the addition of Smith Barney added significant scale and boosted wealth management operating margins from below 10% into the mid-20%s over the past several years while also increasing returns on equity. Looking ahead, we believe the company will benefit from rising asset prices and higher interest rates, should they happen over time…” (Click here to see the full text)9. Caterpillar Inc.

Here is what the firm has to say:“We trimmed Mastercard and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) to equal weights of the Portfolio. Mastercard and Visa operate as a duopoly in a large and growing market. Over the last 50 years, global personal consumer expenditures (PCE) has grown 7-9% annualized. We expect 4-5% long-term PCE growth going forward. Additionally, the shift from cash to credit continues unabated, with a total credit penetration of only approximately 50% globally.3 This shift provides Visa and Mastercard with another ~4-6% of growth. When combined with PCE, this gives both companies high-single-digit to low-double[1]digit revenue growth opportunities. This growth estimate is before accounting for growth amplifiers like the acceleration of e[1]commerce, the shift from offline to online, and additional services. Both companies enjoy extremely strong network effects that provide strong competitive advantages.We have trimmed Visa and Mastercard because their combined weight grew to over 12% of the Global Growth Portfolio because of their recent performance and to fund our increase in Amazon’s position size. We added to both positions when their prices were depressed due to cross-border transactions deteriorating materially from the pandemic. Cross-border volumes came roaring back when travel corridors reopened, and although we are several quarters removed from the cross-border nadir, Visa still grew volumes &gt;30% in 1Q23. Total cross-border volumes are now 132% of 2019 levels. At 4.5% each, both companies remain high conviction positions for Global Growth.”7.

(NYSE:FCX) and health care facilities operator HCA Healthcare. With little fundamental news to report, Freeport-McMoRan’s share price advance in Q4 reflected a rebound in copper prices, driven by the recognition that copper inventories are low relative to historical norms.

290,67dc4202-8ae3-363d-9ab6-085b464ff85d,MU,2023-05-17,Is Micron (MU) a Buy as Wall Street Analysts Look Optimistic?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/micron-mu-buy-wall-street-133001199.html,1684243801,STORY,['MU'],"[Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Micron (MU) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Micron currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.71, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 27 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.71 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 27 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 18 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 66.7% and 7.4% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for MUBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for MUCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Micron here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Micron, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is MU Worth Investing In?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Micron, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at -$4.71.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Micron. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Micron.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Designed to keep pace with the accelerating growth of data, these drives provide a major advancement for data centers by lowering operating costs and improving storage efficiency. The Micron 6500 ION is a high-capacity SSD that offers a superior value over competitive QLC-based drives by providing best-in-class performance and enabling a more environmentally sustainable data center. The 6500 ION is able to deliver TLC performance and QLC-like cost due to Micron's 232-layer technology node leadership compared to the competition’s use of sub-200-layer QLC technology. When paired with Micron 6500 ION drives or other SSDs, the Micron XTR SSD delivers extreme endurance that enhances system performance.“Customers are looking for new capabilities to address the data growth and performance needs of artificial intelligence data lakes and other demanding workloads. As a result, we are seeing tremendous traction on the 6500 ION and XTR with customers who are deploying storage at scale due to their unrivaled combination of large capacity, superior performance, and amazing endurance,” said Alvaro Toledo, vice president and general manager of Micron’s Data Center Storage group. “The 6500 ION SSD offers QLC value with TLC performance and up to a 20% reduction in power consumption versus competing QLC SSDs, allowing our customers to reduce their carbon footprint. Together, these SSDs enable customers to leap ahead and harness the power of artificial intelligence without compromising performance.”Micron 6500 ION SSD: QLC value. TLC performance. Micron innovation. ​The Micron 6500 ION SSD is the demonstrably better performing high-capacity value SSD compared to the primary alternative1 with:Story continues34% better average read latency258% faster sequential writes3Up to 62% more 4KB random read IOPS4Over 30 times more 4KB random write IOPS at a queue depth (QD) of 128 and over 10 times more at QD1More than 10 times better 4KB random write endurance (RDWPD)5The Micron 6500 ION also unleashes this high performance in real-world workload testing:For Ceph object storage workloads, high-performance, high-capacity NVMe SSDs like the Micron 6500 ION are an ideal fit offering high performance and massive capacity in the same object store. Moreover, the Micron 6500 ION NVMe SSD test results show meaningful performance improvements in all tested workloads against the leading competitor.1Ceph object storage workload results6:100% sequential writes are up to 3.5 times better100% sequential reads are up to 47% better100% random reads are up to 49% betterMixed I/O (sequential reads and writes) are up to 62% betterMixed I/O (random reads and sequential writes) are up to 27% betterFor Cassandra NoSQL database, a highly scalable, distributed database used for workloads such as fraud detection, global logistics, cloud document storage, and social media applications, the Micron 6500 ION SSD routinely demonstrates higher peak performance and better 99.99% (four nines) read latency than the competitor’s QLC SSD. The Micron 6500 ION’s peak performance is up to 2.6 times better than the competitor’s drive for the Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark7 (YCSB) Workload C (100% read profile). The four nines read latency is up to 9.2 times better for the YCSB Workload F (recording user sessions profile). These improvements across a broad range of common NoSQL workloads will often have a significant impact on data center performance, making the Micron 6500 ION SSD the preferred high-capacity SSD for Cassandra and other NoSQL database deployments.For WEKA software-defined storage, a high-performance, scalable software storage solution, the Micron 6500 ION proves that it can help deliver massive storage capacity and workload results without the compromises of the competitor’s QLC SSD. In a six-node cluster configuration, the WEKA cluster with 48 Micron 6500 ION SSDs delivers up to 5.2 million IOPS and up to a whopping 112GB/s throughput per node – all while providing nearly 1.5PB to the cluster.“WEKA is leading a paradigm shift in how data is stored, managed, and processed. Our software-defined solution helps organizations transform their traditional, stagnant data silos into dynamic, fluid data pipelines that fuel next-generation workloads like AI, ML, and HPC seamlessly and sustainably,” said Nilesh Patel, WEKA’s chief product officer. “The WEKA Data Platform requires a high-performance hardware or cloud foundation to deliver maximum value to our customers. Through our collaboration with Micron and its new 6500 ION, we can deliver the performance our customers rely on with improved power consumption and cost savings.”The Micron 6500 ION reduces upfront purchase costs by coming in at a comparable price point to QLC SSDs while improving performance and endurance.8 It decreases operating expenses by using less power and requires less cooling. The drive’s 30.72TB capacity and dense form factors facilitate server consolidation lessening server software license costs9 and carbon emissions — all while outperforming and outlasting the competition. The 6500 ION also provides the industry’s most advanced security features including Federal Information and Processing Standards (FIPS) ASIC certifiability and compliance with the Trade Agreement Act (TAA).“Supermicro works with leading suppliers such as Micron to bring the latest technology to demanding customers worldwide who require a high-performing and secure storage technology,” said Wally Liaw, Co-Founder and Senior Vice President of Business Development at Supermicro. “Customers that choose the new Micron 6500 ION SSD for their storage solutions can leverage its security features and the value of QLC with TLC performance.”Micron XTR SSD: Extreme endurance for write-intensive workloads.The Micron XTR SSD delivers extreme endurance to enable the reliable caching necessary for write-heavy workloads. When paired with the Micron 6500 ION, the Micron XTR optimizes storage workloads with minimal investment when compared to storage class memory-based solutions. The Micron XTR SSD is ideal for use cases that are write-intensive such as caching tiers, write buffering, logging and journaling, and online transaction processing workloads. Designed with Micron’s proven vertically integrated storage architecture, the Micron XTR SSD also features an industry-leading security suite to instill confidence in data center deployments.The Micron XTR SSD allows:Up to 35 random drive writes per day (DWPD) and up to 60 sequential DWPD; endurance ratings that far exceed conventional SSDsUp to 35% of the random DWPD endurance at 20% of the cost of a SCM SSD10Up to 44% less power consumption1120% more usable capacity12In Microsoft SQL Server Analytics workload testing, where exceptional storage performance and optimal endurance are vital, the Micron XTR and Micron 6500 ION SSDs perform similarly to a solution using Micron 6500 ION and storage class memory (SCM) SSDs.13 When the Micron XTR and 6500 ION SSDs are combined, the Micron XTR fulfills the same role as the SCM SSDs by delivering nearly identical query performance.14 The Micron 6500 ION offers primary storage to meet the SQL Server performance and capacity needs, while the Micron XTR enables the endurance needed for the write-intensive operations in SQL Server, such as the tempdb volumes.15With the availability of the 6500 ION and XTR SSDs, Micron now delivers an innovative duo of high-capacity and high-endurance NVMe SSDs. This new SSD combination enables data center operators to massively scale storage, control costs and improve data center sustainability by using less power than previous technologies.The 30.72TB capacity Micron 6500 ION SSD is available in the U.3 (15mm) and E1.L (9.5mm) form factor, while the Micron XTR is available in the U.3 (15mm) form factor in both 960GB and 1.92TB capacities.Visit micron.com/6500ION and micron.com/XTR for more information.ResourcesProduct pages: Micron 6500 ION SSD and Micron XTR SSDBlog: Micron 6500 ION SSDTech briefs:Micron 6500 ION SSD Ceph Tech Brief Micron 6500 ION SSD Cassandra Tech BriefMicron 6500 ION SSD WEKA Tech BriefMicron XTR SQL Server Analytics Tech BriefAbout Micron Technology, Inc.We are an industry leader in innovative memory and storage solutions transforming how the world uses information to enrich life for all.

Brands (YUM) Stock Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-retain-yum-brands-185806478.html,1684263486,STORY,"['CHUY', 'CMG', 'ARCO', 'YUM']","[Yum! Brands, Inc. YUM is likely to benefit from strong Taco Bell performance, unit expansion and digital initiatives. Also, the emphasis on the rollout of digital order pickup shelves bodes well. However, commodity inflation is a concern.Let us discuss the factors that highlight why investors should retain the stock for now.Factors Driving GrowthYUM! Brands is benefiting from increased contributions from Taco Bell. During first-quarter 2023, Taco Bell's revenues were $572 million, up 11% from the year-ago quarter's levels. The upside was primarily backed by same-store sales growth (of 12%) and unit growth (6%). During the quarter, the company reported solid demand with respect to crave-able product offerings, including Crispy Melt Taco and the Grilled Cheese Burrito. It also initiated delivery service through its mobile app, boosting customer access for its crave-able products.During the quarter, Taco Bell's International system sales increased 25% year over year, courtesy of continued development momentum and strong value propositions (through menu innovation offerings). The company announced that it is focused on building momentum in markets like the U.K., China, Spain and India. Given the emphasis on consumer value proposition, expanded digital access and franchise partners, the company anticipates the momentum to continue in the upcoming periods.Yum! Brands implemented various digital features in mobile and online platforms across all brand segments to enhance guest experience. The company is accelerating its delivery services and the results have been positive so far. In first-quarter 2023, it reported digital sales of approximately $7 billion. YUM made significant progress concerning the rollout of digital order pickup shelves. To this end, the company added pickup shelves at Habit Burger Grill stores and Taco Bell. Given the emphasis on expanding options and ease for off-premise consumption, the company anticipates deploying pickup shelves across the rest of the system by early 2023.The company continues to focus on expansion efforts to drive growth. Considering its existing footprint of more than 50,000 restaurants worldwide, YUM! Brands believes it can nearly triple its current global presence over the long term. During the first quarter of 2023, the company opened 746 gross new units, including nearly 271 gross new units at Pizza Hut and 385 gross new units at KFC. The company reported solid developmental contributions from each brand in China, India and Latin America markets. It anticipates achieving a long-term unit growth of 5% in the upcoming periods.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the past six months, shares of the company have gained 12.2% compared with the Retail – Restaurants industry’s 10.4% growth.ConcernsThe company has been continuously shouldering increased expenses, which have been detrimental to margins. In first-quarter 2023, its net costs and expenses amounted to $1,122 million compared with $1,038 million reported in the prior-year quarter. The transfer of business and exit from Russia incorporated certain additional costs, which hurt the margins of the company. Also, spikes in commodity inflation added to the downside. We believe that costs associated with brand positioning in all key markets and ongoing investments in initiatives are likely to dent margins in the near term. Although most dining services are open, traffic is still low compared with pre-pandemic levels.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksYum!

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: McDonald's MCD, Booking Holdings BKNG and Marriott International MAR.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:Fresh Macro Data Looks Key: Global Week AheadThe Global Week Ahead holds many key macro prints.As to events?On Sunday, voters in Turkey headed to the polls to select a new President.Ahead of us, this trading week shows key deadlines:·         U.S. lawmakers race to thrash out a deal on the U.S. borrowing limit, and·         Time is short for Russia &amp; Ukraine to agree on how to keep grain exports flowingNext are Reuters five world market themes, reordered for equity traders--(1) Fresh U.S. Macro Data: Retail Sales, Industrial Production, Housing StartsA batch of key economic data will shed fresh light on whether the United States is staving off a downturn given Federal Reserve rate hikes.Tuesday's Retail Sales data will gauge the health of consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity.Retail sales fell more than expected in March, as consumers cut back on buying motor vehicles and other big-ticket items.Reports are also due on Industrial Production and Housing Starts, while the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey could also influence asset prices this week.Data on Wednesday showed annual U.S. consumer inflation slowed to below 5% in April for the first time in two years.Still, inflation remained well above the Fed's 2% target.(2) Fresh Macro Data Arrives for Europe, TooThe week ahead brings current and historic assessments of euro area economic growth, with Q1 GDP data and the influential ZEW Institute surveys of business conditions and sentiment in European powerhouse economy Germany.Story continuesEconomists polled by Reuters expect to see the ""flash"" estimate will show the euro area eked out growth of just 0.1% in the three months to March.Some economists say stagnation has continued and could result in a recession later this year.Euro area monetary indicators, such as credit demand, point to steep declines in consumption and investment. Household savings rates are rising as borrowing falls.None of this is guaranteed to dissuade the European Central Bank from continuing to raise rates, as core inflation, at +5.6% in April, remains too far above its 2.0% target to overlook.(3) Yellen in Spotlight, at the G7 Finance Minister Summit in JapanJanet Yellen has a three-pronged focus for the G7 finance ministers meeting under way in Niigata, Japan: tackling global inflation, bolstering long-term growth and redoubling support for Ukraine.But many of her colleagues may well be asking her how a potentially disastrous U.S. default can be averted.The U.S. Treasury Secretary delayed the start of her trip to devote more time to tackling the issue. However, bipartisan divides run deep, and President Joe Biden has hinted he may not even make it to Hiroshima for the G7 leaders meeting the following weekend.That would complicate a reported side summit with Japan and South Korea on strengthening security cooperation.Host nation Japan has more at stake than many in this standoff: It is the largest foreign holder of U.S. debt.(4) Turkey's Long-Time President Erdogan On the RopesPresident Tayyip Erdogan has ruled Turkey with a firm grip for more than two decades. He faced a tight race against opposition rival Kemal Kilicdaroglu when the 85-million-people strong nation voted on Sunday.Their first contest ended with neither getting 50% of the vote. A runoff happens on May 28th.Polls suggested Kilicdaroglu had a chance, as many Turks are disenchanted with Erdogan, whose unorthodox economic and monetary policy has left them with a sharp decline in living standards, battered by crippling inflation and facing a collapsing lira.There was also widespread dissatisfaction over how the government responded to a February earthquake that killed more than 50,000 people and left millions homeless.Erdogan could yet prevail given a strong support base in the devout working-class Anatolian heartland. Even if he doesn't, it's hard to envisage the feisty politician quietly bowing out of office.Whoever wins has a challenging task to get the economy back on track.(5) Russia &amp; Ukraine Must Renegotiate Grain Export DealRussia and Ukraine have until May 18th to extend the Black Sea grain deal, which last year allowed the safe passage of Ukrainian exports to help tackle a global food crisis.The two sides could extend the agreement, but Russia says it will walk unless its demands to remove obstacles to its own exports are met. The two are among the world's biggest exporters and supply some of the poorest countries.Since Russia invaded Ukraine, wheat futures have dropped by more than 50% from record highs. World food prices have cooled off and the upcoming global harvest is projected to be healthy. That suggests an interruption might not have the same impact as the initial blockade.But the price of staples such as bread remain sky-high.Bread in the European Union cost almost 20% more in March than a year ago. It's far worse in the developing world, where a larger share of household incomes are spent on food.Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY) StocksNext are 3 large-cap consumer-oriented stocks, showing Zacks Growth ratings of B.(1) McDonald's : Another shockingly high $295 sticker price is found in the currently hot Retail-Restaurants industry.The market cap is $217B.

297,7e9f2aa0-361a-3f8e-bd3a-261257ac9330,MCD,2023-05-17,Brokers Suggest Investing in McDonald's (MCD): Read This Before Placing a Bet,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brokers-suggest-investing-mcdonalds-mcd-133001170.html,1684243801,STORY,['MCD'],"[Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about McDonald's (MCD) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.McDonald's currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.63, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 26 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.63 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 26 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 16 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 61.5% and 11.5% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for MCDBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for MCDCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for McDonald's here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying McDonald's, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Story continuesZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is MCD Worth Investing In?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for McDonald's, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 5% over the past month to $11.03.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for McDonald's. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for McDonald's may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Accordingly, Newell Brands announced the declaration of a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share. The dividend is payable June 15, 2023 to common stockholders of record at the close of business on May 31, 2023.Over the past several months, as previously communicated, the management team has undertaken a refresh of the corporate strategy, encompassing: a comprehensive assessment of where Newell Brands stands versus best-in-class competition on the key capabilities required to win in this industry, an updated and integrated set of where to play and how to win choices, an assessment of the talent and culture required to enact the strategy refresh, as well as an evaluation of the capital allocation priorities required to support the new strategy.Management continues to expect a strong rebound in Newell Brands’ cash flow performance in 2023 and remains confident about the cash flow generation potential of the business.

Shares have benefited from investors seeking safety in areas with less economic and interest rate sensitivity. With about one third of its sales generated by blockbuster oncology drug Keytruda, the key issue for investors is the success of its large R&amp;D pipeline to replace those sales when Keytruda comes off patent in 2028. However, Merck seems to be getting little credit from investors for the 60+ programs it has in clinical development, despite having several solid and large new product opportunities.

The actual card is fairly sleek (as you can see below), as customers names are etched into an Apple titanium card. The no-fee card generated a lot of hype, as many early users were quick to post their latest card on various social media sites.The initial goal of Marcus (back in 2016) was to leverage Goldman’s wonderful name brand and build a full-service digital bank. This card was a large piece of GS’s ambitions to grow its retail banking franchise called Marcus. After 5 years, Marcus now has 14 million customers and $16 billion in loan balances. Surprisingly, Marcus now represents nearly 20% of the firm’s total revenue.We thought it would be interesting to look how the Apple Card is doing in terms of loans and exposures. With over $100 billion in assets, this has been a successful source of cheap deposits for GS. Despite having an institutional / “white shoe” brand in the investment banking and trading world, GS’s Apple Card has been a disappointment.” (Click here to read the full text)11.

MS is a leading investment bank and wealth management firm with approximately $5 trillion of client assets under management. It merged Citigroup’s Smith Barney business into its own wealth management business after the 2008 recession/financial crisis, which resulted in a more stable business model. Recent acquisitions of asset manager Eaton Vance and E-Trade provide additional stability and higher returns on capital. We believe MS has a sustainable competitive advantage due to its size and scale, global reach, strong reputation, and financial distribution capabilities. Importantly for a financial institution, it is in good financial health as key leverage ratios including common equity Tier 1 ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio, Tier 1 leverage ratio, and supplementary leverage ratio were all well above required minimums at the end of 2021.Our thesis on MS is that its wealth management business will continue to become a larger part of the overall company, which will increase overall margins and return on equity (ROE). Wealth management and asset management are less cyclical than investment banking, and often generate higher margins and provide better stability of financial results. For example, the addition of Smith Barney added significant scale and boosted wealth management operating margins from below 10% into the mid-20%s over the past several years while also increasing returns on equity. Looking ahead, we believe the company will benefit from rising asset prices and higher interest rates, should they happen over time…” (Click here to see the full text)9. Caterpillar Inc.

Over the last 50 years, global personal consumer expenditures (PCE) has grown 7-9% annualized. We expect 4-5% long-term PCE growth going forward. Additionally, the shift from cash to credit continues unabated, with a total credit penetration of only approximately 50% globally.3 This shift provides Visa and Mastercard with another ~4-6% of growth. When combined with PCE, this gives both companies high-single-digit to low-double[1]digit revenue growth opportunities. This growth estimate is before accounting for growth amplifiers like the acceleration of e[1]commerce, the shift from offline to online, and additional services. Both companies enjoy extremely strong network effects that provide strong competitive advantages.We have trimmed Visa and Mastercard because their combined weight grew to over 12% of the Global Growth Portfolio because of their recent performance and to fund our increase in Amazon’s position size. We added to both positions when their prices were depressed due to cross-border transactions deteriorating materially from the pandemic. Cross-border volumes came roaring back when travel corridors reopened, and although we are several quarters removed from the cross-border nadir, Visa still grew volumes &gt;30% in 1Q23. Total cross-border volumes are now 132% of 2019 levels. At 4.5% each, both companies remain high conviction positions for Global Growth.”7.

The company has been serving the country’s dental practitioners since 2014.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHenry Schein completed its majority share acquisition of Biotech Dental in April 2022, expanding its comprehensive integrated suite of planning and diagnostic software and dental implants and Clear Aligners portfolio. In May, HSIC announced the acquisition of Regional Health Care Group, a medical product distribution company serving customers in Australia and New Zealand. The addition will leverage the countries’ infrastructure to expand HSIC’s offering to medical practitioners in the region.Story continuesContributions From the Dental Business: In the first quarter of 2023, Henry Schein reported a 3.8% year-over-year increase in global Dental sales to $1.9 billion. The dental distribution business was fueled by an aging global population and the growing awareness of the benefits of preventative care and oral hygiene.Of the dental equipment, traditional equipment sales grew strongly in contrast to digital equipment comprising 2D, 3D digital imaging, mills and intra-oral scanners. The global bookings of traditional equipment remained robust and rose year-over-year.Within HSIC’s Global Dental Specialty business, implant sales growth was driven by the premium Camlog product line in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.Technology and Value-Added Services Business: Within the segment, the largest component — Henry Schein One — reported both domestic and international growth in the first quarter of 2023.North America registered strong sales of Dentrix and Dentrix Ascend cloud-based solutions and a customer shift from the Easy Dental product, with the Easy Dental lifecycle ending later this year. Internationally, the growth was fully supported by cloud-based solutions, particularly in Australia and New Zealand, where it was recently launched. During the first-quarter earnings call, HSIC noted that its customer base for Dentrix and Dentrix Ascend increased nearly 30% from the prior year.Recently, the company announced the full integration of AI solutions into Dentrix Ascend —the company’s cloud-based practice management software. The solutions Dentrix Ascend Detect AI and Dentrix Ascend Voice offer powerful tools to help dental professionals improve case acceptance and elevate patient care through accurate diagnoses.DownsidesPPE &amp; COVID-19 Test Kit Sales Continue to Decline: Lower sales of PPE products and COVID test kits continue to impact Henry Schein’s overall top line. The company reported a 35% year-over-year decrease in sales of PPE products and an approximately 80% year-over-year decline in COVID-19 test kit sales in the first quarter of 2023.HSIC also maintained its original 2023 guidance of a 20%-25% decline in PPE product sales.Mounting Expenses Put Pressure: Mounting operating expenses negatively affected the company’s adjusted operating margin in the first quarter. The contraction was mainly due to lower gross profit dollars from PPE and COVID-19 test kit sales and higher acquisition-related costs, partially offset by a gross margin rate improvement.Estimate TrendHenry Schein has been witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for 2023. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has remained constant at $5.32 in the past 60 days and has moved 1.1% south to $5.26 in the past seven days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $12.84 billion, suggesting a 1.5% decline from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Zimmer Biomet ZBH, Penumbra PEN and Hologic, Inc.

319,56dffc01-6f1f-3755-a1cc-36fec45113ce,COF,2023-05-17,Warren Buffett and J.P. Morgan Have One Thing in Common: They Both Like These 2 Stocks,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-j-p-morgan-223155797.html,1684276315,STORY,"['BRK-A', 'COF', 'COF-PK', 'COF-PL', 'COF-PN', 'HPQ']","[When the legendary investor Warren Buffett makes a move, Wall Street pays attention. Known as the ‘Oracle of Omaha’ and the mastermind behind Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett has amassed a fortune of over $100 billion throughout his career. Buffett’s preferred investing style has always been value investing, which entails identifying undervalued stocks with strong fundamentals.So, it’s definitely worth nosing through Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway portfolio to see which stocks he recently bought. And when some of those stocks also get the endorsement of one of Wall Street’s top banks, such as J.P. Morgan, it sends an even stronger signal these names could be ripe for the picking.With this in mind, we opened up the TipRanks database to pull up the details on a pair of stocks that get a thumbs up from both of these investing institutions. Let’s take a closer look.Capital One Financial (COF)First up on our list is Capital One Financial, a bank holding company based in Fairfax County, Virginia. Capital One is well-known as a credit card issuer – the company’s ‘What’s in your wallet?’ tagline is ubiquitous in TV commercials. Additionally, the company is involved in retail and commercial banking, savings accounts, and automotive loans.Capital One’s banking operations offers retail clients the advantages of no-fee banking, and access to more than 70,000 ATMs. These advantages are backed up by the bank’s assets – Capital One had $349.8 billion in total deposits as of the March 31 of this year, part of its $471.7 billion in total assets held.The company reported its 1Q23 results at the end of April. The top-line result of $8.9 billion was down 2% year-over-year and missed the forecast by $163.8 million. At the bottom line, the bank’s adjusted EPS of $2.31 was less than half of the year-ago figure of $5.62 and fell well short of the $3.93 forecast.The picture isn’t all gloomy, however. Capital One, at the beginning of May, declared its regular quarterly dividend, and kept the payment at 60 cents per common share. This marked the seventh straight quarter with the dividend at this level. The annualized rate, of $2.40, gives a yield of 2.6%, above the approximately 2% market average.Story continuesBuffett must think the positives far outweigh the negatives here. In Q1, he bought 9,922,000 shares of COF, a stake which is currently worth $902.4 million.Buffett is not the only bull here. Assessing the company’s prospects, JPMorgan 5-star analyst Richard Shane believes that this is a stock to pick up and hold on to.“We reiterate OW and see potential near-term weakness as opportunity for investors with intermediate to long-term horizons… COF has the potential to deliver the highest returns within the credit card group as solid fundamentals and adverse sentiment converge. The company has a CET1 ratio above its historical average, substantial loss reserves, and stable funding reflecting the company’s leading depository franchise (branch and on-line),” Shane opined.These comments back up Shane’s Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating, while his $102 price target implies a potential upside of 12% for the stock. (To watch Shane’s track record, click here)Overall, according to TipRanks, the stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating, based on 13 recent analyst reviews that include 7 Buys, 4 Holds, and 2 Sells. The average price target, of $111.27, is more bullish than the JPM view, and suggests a 22% upside from the current trading price of $90.95. (See COF stock forecast)HP, Inc. (HPQ)Shifting our focus from banking to the tech industry, let’s take a closer look at HP. As a prominent name in personal computing, HP has a rich history as a descendant of Hewlett-Packard. In 2015, it separated from its parent company and now operates independently, focusing on its PC and printer divisions. Today, HP offers an extensive range of products, including PCs, laptops, printers, ink cartridges, monitors, and accessories. They have expanded their offerings to include audio-visual devices, gaming peripherals, and even high-quality printer paper.The turn toward remote work and home office upgrades during the pandemic lockdown period proved to be a net benefit for HP, and the company saw improved sales during that time. In recent quarters, however, revenues have begun to tail off. The company is seeing a slump in demand for new PCs, partly because potential customers – both commercial and retail – made recent upgrades during the pandemic, but also because, in an increasingly uncertain economic environment, customers are starting to hold back on large purchases.This was particularly visible in fiscal 1Q23, when HP reported a top line revenue total of $13.83 billion, a total that missed the analyst estimates by $345.6 million, and was down almost 19% year-over-year. The company’s non-GAAP earnings per share was reported as 75 cents, in-line with expectations.While the fiscal first quarter showed weak results, HP’s outlook, reflected in its full year guidance, remains upbeat. The company is predicting EPS for 2023 in the range between $3.20 and $3.60 per share; this gives a midpoint of $3.40, well above the $3.29 consensus estimate. In addition, the company expects to see the free cash flow for the 2023 to come in between $3 billion and $3.5 billion. The midpoint of this range, $3.25 million, exceeds the $3.09 billion estimate by $160 million.HP’s outlook is not the only bright spot. The company has been gradually raising the dividend since the end of 2015, and the most recent declaration, of a 26.25 cent common share dividend, is to be paid on July 5. At the annualized rate of $1.05 per common share, the dividend is currently yielding 3.63%.Buffett evidently likes the investment opportunity here. The famed investor increased his existing holding in HPQ by 16,476,783 shares in 1Q23. This marked a 16% increase in his stake, which now comprises more than 120.9 million shares of HPQ, currently valued at nearly $3.59 billion.As for JPMorgan, the firm has taken a bullish stance on HP, banking on a recovery in consumer strength and PC demand. Analyst Samik Chatterjee lays out the JPM position: “Led by our Global PC model which embeds a 21% increase in volumes for the PC end-market between 1H23 and 2H23, we are raising our PS segment forecasts for HPQ led by a favorable position in the Consumer segment, which is expected to be the primary driver of the recovery. In addition, with gross margins stabilizing following the digestion of inventory in the channel, we expect operating margin upside to stem from revenue leverage off a lean cost structure.”In Chatterjee’s view, this supports both an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating, and a $35 price target which indicates potential for 18% share appreciation. (To watch Chatterjee’s track record, click here)While Buffett and JPMorgan are ready to commit to HPQ, Wall Street generally is not so sure. The stock’s 8 recent analyst reviews break down to a single Buy, 5 Holds, and 2 Sells, for an analyst consensus of Hold. The stock is selling for $29.66 and the average price target, now at $29.38, suggests shares will remain range bound for the foreseeable future.

The Oracle of Omaha sold a large portion of Berkshire’s holdings in US banks between 2020 and 2022, some just months before the banking system upheaval that began in mid March.The 92-year-old investor has over the decades played the role of rescuer to a number of institutions, including in the 2008 financial crisis. He has yet to emerge as a white knight for any banks in trouble during this current crisis, at least in any way that has thus far been made public.Buffett made it clear at Berkshire's annual shareholders meeting earlier this month that he is still ""cautious"" about holding many bank stocks. One exception he cited was Bank of America, which remains one of Berkshire’s largest holdings.Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Warren Buffett at a 2019 shareholders meeting. REUTERS/Scott Morgan (Scott Morgan / Reuters)In the first quarter, according to filings, Berkshire maintained its Bank of America holdings. The stake lost $4 billion in value through the quarter.""I like Bank of America and I like the management,"" Buffett said at the shareholder gathering in Omaha, Nebraska.Buffett has a long history with Bank of America. He injected $5 billion into the Charlotte, N.C.-based bank in 2011. At the time Brian Moynihan was still a relatively new chief executive and the lender's shares were under severe pressure due to losses from subprime loans.Buffett did invest more deeply into several other financial stocks in the quarter. Berkshire added $954 million of Capital One (COF) and raised its holding in Ally Financial (ALLY) by $10.6 million. The conglomerate also sold $1.1 million of Jefferies Financial Group (JEF) and didn't touch its stake in Citigroup (C).Story continuesUS Bancorp, BNY Mellon and Jefferies were down in early after hours trading while Bank of America, Citi, Capital One and Ally were up.Berkshire Hathaway was far from the only high profile investment manager selling bank shares last quarter.Bridgewater Associates, the world's biggest hedge fund, sold about $180 million in bank stocks.That included more than 80% of its holdings in Bank of New York Mellon and US Bancorp. Bridgewater also zeroed out positions in 15 other US lenders, including Bank of America (BAC), Western Alliance, Zions (ZION), PacWest (PACW) and New York Community Bank (NYCB).Correction (5/16): an earlier version of the article said Berkshire Hathaway raised its Bank of America holdings in the first quarter.

Shares of peer Lowe's Companies Inc fell 1.16%.""You can argue that people are tired of spending on the house, they want experiences, they want to go out they want to do other things, they don’t want to fix up the house according to Home Depot, because they had horrendous earnings,"" said Ken Polcari, managing partner at Kace Capital Advisors in Boca Raton, Florida.The Commerce Department reported retail sales rose 0.4% in April, short of the estimate for an increase of 0.8%.

That slowing along with recent negotiations over the U.S. debt ceiling has focused attention on when the central bank will pause hiking, or cut interest rates.Story continuesWhile the market is currently pricing in a rate cut by the end of the year, recent comments from Fed officials suggested they are not ready to cut rates soon.Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said he was ""comfortable"" with raising interest rates further if needed, but liked the ""optionality"" implied in the latest policy statement.Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said she does not think the central bank can hold interest rates steady yet.Lawmakers held a new round of talks about raising the debt ceiling. The Treasury Department has warned it could run out of money as soon as June 1 without a deal, which would trigger a default and likely cause a sharp economic slump.Horizon Therapeutics tumbled 14.17% as the Federal Trade Commission said it would file a lawsuit to block Amgen Inc's $27.8 billion deal to buy the company. Shares of Amgen fell 2.42%.The decline in both stocks weighed on the Nasdaq Biotech Index, which closed at a three-week low after dropping 2.44%, its biggest one-day percentage decline in three months.Shares of Capital One Financial Corp climbed 2.05% the day after Berkshire Hathaway Inc disclosed it had taken a stake of nearly $1 billion in the stock.Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 4.05-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.28-to-1 ratio favored decliners.The S&amp;P 500 posted 12 new 52-week highs and 13 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 47 new highs and 188 new lows.Volume on U.S. exchanges was 9.36 billion shares, compared with the 10.58 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.(Reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak; Editing by David Gregorio)]"

It is worth considering Ulta Beauty (ULTA), which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Miscellaneous industry.This beauty products retailer has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 23.98%.For the most recent quarter, Ulta was expected to post earnings of $5.69 per share, but it reported $6.68 per share instead, representing a surprise of 17.40%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $4.09 per share, while it actually produced $5.34 per share, a surprise of 30.56%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor Ulta, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Ulta currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.66%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on May 25, 2023.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate.

Ulta Beauty (ULTA) earns a Zacks Rank #2 nine days from its next quarterly earnings release on May 25, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $6.86 a share.ULTA has an Earnings ESP figure of 0.66%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $6.86 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.81.ULTA is just one of a large group of Retail-Wholesale stocks with a positive ESP figure.

Investors have to deal with both regulatory and economic uncertainty and closely monitor the progress of clinical trials to identify inflection points. However, there are handsome rewards associated with successful pharmaceutical companies as well, which is why growth investors tend to keep a close eye on this area.VRTX 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of VRTXPeter Lynch Chart of VRTXVertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:VRTX) has made steady progress in recent years, both from a financial and market performance perspective. On the back of a more than 30% gain in the last 12 months, the stock seems well-positioned to deliver attractive returns in the coming years.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Offers Value Despite Recent GainsThe businessVertex is a Boston-based biotech company focused on the development and commercialization of therapies for treating cystic fibrosis. The company has already received the Food and Drug Administration's approval for four main drugs, Kalydeco, Orkambi, Symdeko and Trikafta, which currently enjoy monopolistic power in the market.The company is now expanding its footprint beyond cystic fibrosis to areas such as sickle cell disease and variants of kidney diseases. Vertexs drug pipeline comprises several mid- and late-stage clinical trials aimed at fighting these diseases in addition to type 1 diabetes and neuropathic pain.The large addressable market opportunity for cystic fibrosis drugsAs the leading drugmaker treating cystic fibrosis, Vertex has a long runway for growth. According to data from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, there were 83,000 patients across the U.S., Europe, Australia and Canada affected by the disease in 2021. That number is estimated to have eclipsed 88,000 today. Close to 57,000 of these patients are currently treated with Vertexs CF drugs, and an additional 20,000 patients can be treated with currently approved drugs marketed by the company.Story continuesThe company is aiming to onboard these patients to a treatment plan centered around its drugs. VX-522, a cystic fibrosis drug currently in Phase 1 clinical trials, is expected to expand Vertexs addressable market by another 5,000 patients if it can obtain regulatory approval. VX-522 has received the Fast Track Designation from the FDA.Vertex is also targeting a global launch of Trikafta/Kaftario in patients between two and five years of age later this year, which is likely to expand its target market further.With the advancement of these drugs, cystic fibrosis patients are expected to live longer, with the median age of survival currently at 65 years. The longer life expectancy of these patients creates an opportunity for Vertex to gain a consistent cash flow stream from the commercialization of its drugs.The pipeline strengthWhen investing in a biotech company, investors should pay close attention to the strength of its pipeline as future earnings depend largely on the success of these drugs. Vertexs most important pipeline drug candidate is its gene-editing exa-cel drug, which is being developed in partnership with CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP). This drug is aimed at treating two diseases: beta thalassemia and sickle cell disease. The company is currently awaiting a regulatory decision on exa-cel after filing for approval in several key markets, including the U.S. and the U.K. Based on the promising clinical trial results, some analysts expect it to begin commercialization as early as 2024. According to Vertexs regulatory filings, exa-cel holds the potential for a one-time, functional cure for the two blood diseases.The company has made progress with its clinical trials for VX-548 in treating acute pain. Millions of Americans suffer from some form of acute pain every year, and Vertex has identified an opportunity to develop a treatment to help patients manage it better. The drug has already entered Phase III clinical trials, and the FDA has granted it both a Fast Track Designation and Breakthrough Therapy Designation, allowing the company to commercialize the drug in the near term if the trilas deliver the desired results.Vertex recently projected five drug launches in the next five years to drive earnings growth. Although this is an ambitious target given the complex regulatory environment surrounding the approval of new drugs, the company seems to be headed in the right direction to achieving this objective, which is evident from the strength of its pipeline.TakeawayVertex Pharmaceuticals is making steady progress with its pipeline drugs while continuing to benefit from the strong market position of its cystic fibrosis treatments. The companys drugs will enjoy patent protection for several more years, which gives its ample time to bring other drugs to the market.With many treatments on the brink of obtaining regulatory approval, Vertex seems attractively valued at a forward price-earnings ratio of 24.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

The deal signifies the efficiency and reliability of Embraer jets in witnessing strong orders and the strengthening business relationship between the two companies. NetJets has been the buyer of Embraer’s jets for more than a decade and owns a family of 120 Embraer aircraft.Valued at more than $5 billion, the deal involves the delivery of 250 Praetor 500 jets to NetJets and highlights other comprehensive support services for the jets.

There are nearly 30 defendants, including Norfolk Southern executives and directors and 12 financial services companies that underwrote the bonds.The case is Ohio Carpenters Pension Fund et al v Norfolk Southern Corp et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 23-04068.(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by David Gregorio)]"

Most industry players are looking to drive their bottom line amid the headwinds through cost reduction.Despite the challenges surrounding the industry, Union Pacific Corporation UNP, CSX Corporation CSX and Norfolk Southern Corporation NSC appear better-placed to tide over the challenges.About the IndustryThe Zacks Transportation - Rail industry includes railroad operators transporting freight (such as agricultural products, industrial products, coal, intermodal, automotive, consumer products, metals and minerals), primarily across North America. These companies focus on providing logistics and supply-chain expertise services. While freight constitutes a significant chunk of revenues, some of these companies also derive a small portion of their top line from other rail-related services, including third-party railcar and locomotive repairs, routine land sales and container sales, among others. A few companies offer service to multiple production and distribution facilities. Besides locomotives, some of these companies own equipment of leased locomotives, railcars etc.Factors Relevant to the Industry's FortunesFocus on Cost Cuts to Drive the Bottom Line: The industry has been experiencing significant levels of inflation, including higher prices for labor, freight and fuel. The industry players are focusing on cost-cutting measures and making efforts to improve productivity and efficiency to mitigate high expenses and the effects of a weaker-than-expected demand scenario.Economic Uncertainty: Despite a strong performance by major indices lately, the fact remains that we are by no means out of the woods, especially with respect to inflation-related woes. The recent production cut by the OPEC+ oil cartel, which includes OPEC members plus Russia, has led to a surge in oil prices. This may aggravate inflationary pressure and result in heightened economic uncertainty and market volatility. The turmoil in the banking sector — popularly known as the engine of economic growth — also does not bode well.Story continuesWeak Freight Demand: Risks associated with an economic slowdown, geopolitical tensions and supply-chain woes dampen the prospects of stocks belonging to this industrial cohort. Due to the uncertainty, the Cass Freight Index declined 1% on a month-on-month basis in March. In fact, the index has declined month on month in six out of the last seven months. The slowdown in freight demand does not bode well for railroad operators.Zacks Industry Rank Signals Glum ProspectsThe Zacks Rail industry, housed within the broader Zacks Transportation sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #173. This rank places it in the bottom 31% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are pessimistic about this group’s earnings growth potential. The industry’s earnings estimates for 2023 have moved down 7.6% since May 2022.Despite the gloomy outlook, there are a couple of stocks worth watching in the industry. But before we present them, it is worth looking at the industry’s shareholder returns and current valuation first.Industry Lags S&amp;P 500 But Outperforms SectorOver the past year, the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry has declined 2.4% against the S&amp;P 500 composite’s gain of 3%.

334,f3f6bf01-7400-33ce-8f12-d598a81a6cf1,KO,2023-05-17,"Insiders At Coca-Cola Sold US$17m In Stock, Alluding To Potential Weakness \",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insiders-coca-cola-sold-us-120012456.html,1684324812,STORY,['KO'],"[Many The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Coca-Cola The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Coca-ColaThe Chairman &amp; CEO, James Robert Quincey, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$9.6m worth of shares at a price of US$64.33 each. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$63.22. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.In total, Coca-Cola insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At Coca-Cola Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Coca-Cola. Specifically, insiders ditched US$13m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesDoes Coca-Cola Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that Coca-Cola insiders own 0.7% of the company, worth about US$1.8b. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Coca-Cola Tell Us?Insiders haven't bought Coca-Cola stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. While conducting our analysis, we found that Coca-Cola has 2 warning signs and it would be unwise to ignore them.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

The 2.5-foot wide, 2.5-foot deep sauce dispenser features a large touchscreen that offers customers a choice of four bases: Heinz Ketchup, Ranch, 57 Sauce, and BBQ Sauce. Plus, what it's calling enhancers, which currently include Jalapeño, Smoky Chipotle, Buffalo, and Mango. Customers can customize the intensity level of the enhancers (low, medium and high).You'll have to wait though, the Remix is set to debut in-person at the 2023 National Restaurant Association Show in Chicago next week and then in certain restaurants in late 2023 to early 2024. Where? ""Those conversations across the industry are starting and will be ongoing for the next few months,"" said Peter Hall, Kraft Heinz U.S. Away from Home President.Hall called the opportunities for the dispenser ""limitless."" Some likely places: movie theaters, ballparks, football stadiums, schools, college cafeterias, theme parks, and even army bases.What's your pleasure? Kraft Heinz Unveils Heinz Remix, a ""customizable digital sauce dispenser."" (Courtesy: Kraft Heinz)One goal of the machine is efficiency. After customers choose their sauces and insert the cup manually, it will take 8 to 10 seconds for the sauce to pour into the cup. The machine uses a ""unique vortex mixing technology where the sauce is pulled down to the center to ensure it's a clean and simple mix every time,"" Kraft Heinz VP of Disruption Alan Kleinerman said.Workers can swiftly replace the ingredient bags. ""It's a simple drop the bag in, snap it in,"" Kleinerman said. Another timesaver for operators: the machine, the execs said, only needs to be filled once a day.The futuristic machine will also give Kraft Heinz a deeper insight into consumer behavior. Created with the help of Microsoft (MSFT)—it's a cloud/digital device—the robo-dispenser will gather information on customer favorites from a universe of more than 200 potential sauce combinations.Story continues""If we see consumers are mixing ketchup with smoky Chipotle and Jalapeño at a really high rate, restaurant operators want to know that,"" Kleinerman explained. ""That they can use that to improve or update on their menus and we're gonna want to know that"" too.He added: ""We can bring those...consumers are creating away from home, into retail so they can have them in their homes as well.""This latest innovation is all part of Kraft Heinz's overarching goal for its North American business to reach $2B in incremental sales by 2027.

SWAV recently announced the full commercial availability of the Shockwave C2+ Coronary Intravascular Lithotripsy (IVL) Catheter. The device is used for the treatment of severely calcified coronary artery disease (CAD) in select international markets.Shockwave C2+ is commercially available for treating de novo CAD in Europe and select other geographies.In the same press release, Shockwave Medical also announced the enrollment of the first patient in EMPOWER CAD, the first prospective, all-female study of percutaneous coronary intervention. The study seeks to confirm the benefits of coronary IVL in female patients with calcified lesions, who historically have experienced less favorable clinical outcomes than male patients with traditional therapies.The latest commercial availability is expected to aid Shockwave Medical in significantly expanding its footprint in the CAD treatment space and solidifying its position worldwide. The enrollment of patients in the study is also a major stepping stone for the company toward achieving its goal.Significance of the Launch and EnrollmentPer an expert familiar with the use of the Shockwave C2+ Catheter, its intuitive catheter design and ease of use incorporate improvements that will likely enhance procedural efficiency and optimize the treatment of the most challenging morphologies.With respect to the enrollment of patients in the EMPOWER CAD study, an expert associated with it believes the study to be a major step toward better understanding the optimal strategy for calcium modification in female patients. Per the personnel, females are an under-represented patient population, who are often more challenging to treat and experience sub-optimal outcomes.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Research and Markets published on yahoo! finance, the global CAD market is expected to reach $38.17 billion in 2028 from $22.94 billion in 2022 at a CAGR of approximately 8.9%. Factors like rapid growth in the elderly population, unhealthy lifestyles and a rising number of people suffering from obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure are likely to drive the market.Story continuesGiven the market potential, the latest commercial availability is expected to provide a significant boost to Shockwave Medical’s business globally.Notable DevelopmentsThis month, Shockwave Medical announced its first-quarter 2023 results, wherein it registered a solid uptick in its overall top line. Per management, the strong growth in the top line was driven by double-digit growth in the U.S. coronary, U.S. peripheral and International markets. Key revenue drivers include strong uptake of M5+ catheter, the addition of new accounts and appropriate reimbursement. Internationally, SWAV’s sales were boosted by strong momentum in Germany and Japan and a robust contribution from China.Last month, Shockwave Medical announced the completion of its previously-announced acquisition of Neovasc Inc.In March, Shockwave Medical announced the full U.S. commercial availability of the Shockwave L6 Peripheral IVL Catheter.

Chris?Story continuesChristopher A. PosnerThanks, Matt. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. With me today are Ryan Maynard, our Chief Financial Officer; and Dr. Joana Goncalves, our Chief Medical Officer.I'd like to start by giving a quick overview of what I'll address today. For the update on the KORSUVA injection launch in the U.S., I will provide additional metrics that we are tracking to give better insight into the progress of demand and uptake. These will help to give some clarity and show the opportunity within the different customers and segments of the market. I will also review the launch progress in countries around the world. In addition, I will highlight our robust clinical stage pipeline and the advancement of our high-value development programs for oral difelikefalin I am pleased with the progress to date and can confirm that we continue to track to our previously communicated time lines. After that, Ryan will provide you with a financial update, and then we will open up the call to Q&amp;A.Â I will begin with the launch of KORSUVA injection in the U.S. For the first quarter of 2023, net sales for KORSUVA were $5.7 million, translating into $2.8 million of profit recorded as revenue to us. Wholesaler shipments to dialysis clinics more than doubled quarter-over-quarter and reached 46,000 vials. 64% of these vials were shipped to Fresenius or FMC clinics with the remainder split between DaVita and the other dialysis organizations. This increase in vial shipments suggests a meaningful acceleration in demand anecdotal feedback on KORSUNeedham &amp; Company, LLC, Research DivisionVA from both providers and patients continues to be highly positive, supporting this expansion in breadth and depth in its utilization.Â At FMC, orders more than tripled quarter-to-quarter, reaching 30,000 vials. By the end of the first quarter, 500 FMC clinics or 18% had placed reorders, up from 7% of clinics at the end of Q4. More importantly, 1,500 clinics or 56% of FMC clinics had dosed at least 1 patient, up from 29% of clinics at the end of Q4. Total patient demand remains difficult to assess without specific information about the levels of inventory remaining at individual clinics. However, we continue to see significant growth in the number of FMC clinics exhausting their third quarter 2022 bolus inventory and expect that the majority of the FMC clinics will be in a reorder mode in the second half of this year.Â At DaVita, demand growth continues to be steady. At the end of first quarter, 300 clinics or 11% of DaVita clinics had ordered KORSUVA, and that's up from 7% of clinics at the end of Q4. Reorder rates among these clinics remain very encouraging with 70% placing repeat orders. Given the on-demand approach at DaVita clinics for ordering KORSUVA, the growth in clinic orders represents a good proxy for the growth in patient demand. At midsize and independent DOs, KORSUVA continues to perform well. At the end of the first quarter, 13% of these clinics had placed orders, and that's up from 11% at the end of Q4. In addition, 66% of these clinics have placed repeat orders.Â Now the strongest performance to date amongst this group has been at USRC, and that's the largest of the midsized DOs. Roughly 66% of clinics have ordered KORSUVA and 72% of these clinics have placed repeat orders. Stepping back and looking at the big picture, KORSUVA's overall market penetration leaves significant room for growth with the vast majority of the markets still untapped. To get there, CSL Vifor continues to make progress building the market, navigating the idiosyncrasies of each segment across the entire deal landscape. This is reflected in key trends this quarter. Clinic orders doubled quarter-to-quarter. Almost 60% of FMC clinics are dosing a patient, and each segment is seeing an increase in clinics ordering the product. We remain confident and our partner, CSL Vifor remains fully dedicated to capturing the latent upside in this market and maximizing the commercial potential of KORSUVA in the long term.Â Additionally, we are working in close collaboration with the kidney community to help CMS understand the need for a durable an appropriate reimbursement mechanism for TDAPA designated products post their TDAPA period. We remain confident that additional funding will be made available for TDAPA designated products, and we remain hopeful that a substantive and positive update will be released during this year's rule-making cycle. Next, on the international front. The rollout of Kapruvia in Europe continues to gain momentum. In the first quarter, Kapruvia generated $1.2 million in net sales translated into $125,000 of royalty revenues to us. Rollout has begun in 4 additional countries: France, Finland, the Netherlands and Switzerland, bringing the total number of launch countries to 7.Â The initial feedback from patients and providers has been very encouraging and in line with the patient testimonials we have received in the U.S. We continue to expect the additional countries in Europe and other countries around the world to come online throughout the next 12 to 18 months once reimbursement is secured. Also, a decision from the U.K. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, or NICE, is expected imminently. In Japan, we continue to expect a regulatory decision in the second half of 2023. As a reminder, approval in Japan would trigger a $2 million milestone payment to care.Â Last, but certainly not least, I'd like to briefly discuss our promising wholly-owned oral pipeline. Fundamentally, Cara is a development company, and we are committed to building our nephrology and medical dermatology franchises with oral difelikefalin. These efforts will drive us to our goal of being a differentiated company as the world leader in treating chronic pruritus in the long run. Enrollment in our Phase III programs in pruritus associated with advanced chronic kidney disease and in atopic dermatitis is progressing as expected. We anticipate the internal readout of Part A of our KIND-1AD trial in the fourth quarter of this year, with final top line results from this program in the first half 2025. We also continue to expect top line results for our CIC advanced chronic kidney disease program in the second half of 2024. Start-up activities for our Phase II/III program in notalgia paresthetica kicked off in the first quarter of this year, and they are progressing well. The NP program is tracking to the internal readout of KOURAGE 1 Part A in the second half of 2024 and final top line results for the program in the first half of 2026.Â To summarize, we are continuing to work closely with CSL Vifor to accelerate the uptake of KORSUVA, and we remain confident that these efforts will drive near-term growth. Additionally, we remain optimistic regarding CMS' future decision on the post-data funding mechanism and hope to see an update during this year's rule-making cycle. Underscored by the highly positive feedback we are hearing from patients and providers around the world, we continue to believe in the long-term success of KORSUVA Injection. More importantly, we see tremendous value creation for Cara with our 3 late-stage programs with oral difelikefalin. We are fully committed to advancing these programs as rapidly as possible in order to maximize the potential of difelikefalin within our 2 therapeutic franchises. We look forward to providing you with updates on our progress throughout this year. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Ryan for additional details on our first quarter financial results. Over to you, Ryan.Ryan D. MaynardThank you, Chris. Total revenue was $6.2 million for the 3 months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $4.8 million for the same period in 2022. I Revenue this quarter consisted of $2.8 million of collaborative revenue related to our profit from CSL Vifor's net sales of KORSUVA injection to third parties and $3.2 million of commercial supply revenue. We also recognized $125,000 of royalty revenue this quarter, representing our royalties from the net sales of Kapruvia in the first quarter of 2023. Cost of goods sold during the 3 months ended March 31, 2023, was $2.6 million and relates to our commercial supply shipments of KORSUVA injection to CSL Vifor.Â Research and development expenses were $24.3 million for the 3 months ended March 31 and 2023 compared to $21.3 million in the same period of 2020-'22. The increase in R&amp;D expenses is primarily due to the increased clinical spend related to our 3 late-stage clinical programs. General and administrative expenses were $6.9 million for the 3 months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $9.4 million in the same period of 2022. The reduction in G&amp;A expense was due to a decrease in stock-based compensation in the first quarter of 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022. Stock-based compensation in 2022 included costs related to the modification of certain equity awards to our former CEO. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at March 31, 2023, totaled $23.4 million compared to $156.7 million at December 31, 2022. The decrease in the balance primarily resulted from cash used in our operating activities. We expect that our current unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and available for sale marketable securities are sufficient to fund our currently anticipated operating plan into the second half of 2024. This guidance assumes all the spend related to our 3 late-stage clinical development programs and KORSUVA revenue profit share contribution. Finally, I'd like to highlight for everyone that we are exploring certain nondilutive financing opportunities to extend our runway further. I will now turn the call back over to Chris.Christopher A. PosnerThanks, Ryan. I want to reiterate that we are laser-focused on making the KORSUVA injection launch a success. And additionally, we remain confident in the massive potential of our pipeline behind oral difelikefalin. We have full confidence that our long-term strategy will help us achieve our goal of becoming the world leader in the treatment of chronic pruritus and ultimately delivering significant value to our shareholders. With that, Ryan, Jo and I will be happy to take your questions. So Latif, let's open up the line for Q&amp;A.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) first question comes from the line of Joseph Stringer of Needham &amp; Company.Joseph Robert StringerJust 2 from us. Do you have any visibility into the inventory in the clinics? Or is that something that's still opaque? And would you ever gain visibility into this? And then secondly is on the inventory levels at the wholesalers. Can you remind us again what that is just as the inventory levels at wholesalers and do you expect that to make -- to remain relatively constant as the launch progress here?Christopher A. PosnerJoe, nice hearing you. Let me tackle both of those. So the first is around inventory at the Fresenius level. One of the things that we wanted to really focus on this quarter and we and CSL, knew we needed to provide additional metrics or key performance indicators to give more clarity on uptake demand and really opportunity in the market. And we felt it was particularly important with FMC and how its clinics were working through its existing inventory. So the metrics that we're providing around a penetration rate, and that's what I mentioned, roughly 1,500 clinics are actually dosing a patient at Fresenius and that's the best insight we have to how product is being utilized at a clinic level. We don't have specific insight into how much inventory is still remaining, but that gives you a good sense of how many clinics are using the product. And then you couple that with the second critical metric, and that's reorder rates. And here, what's important there is that, that shows how many clinics that have dosed the patient now are becoming recurring customers.And for Fresenius, that metric is particularly important because they've exhausted their inventory, and that metric is actually 500 clinics. And that's up from -- that's up from roughly 200 clinics in the end of Q4. So we're really encouraged about the drawdown in inventory. And I think the punchline there is that we believe by midyear, the majority of FMC clinics will have exhausted their inventory and really be in that reorder mode. And to your second question, Joe, you're on inventory at the wholesaler level, it's pretty standard. I don't know the specific contract between CSL and their wholesalers, but it's not really that atypical versus other traditional markets. So it could be a couple of weeks.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Annabel Samimy of Stifel.Annabel Eva SamimyFor the progress. I just want to go down on your comment that you're considering efforts to accelerate uptake. Do you have any specific tools that you're working with to be able to do that with Fresenius Vifor? If that's the first question. I'll follow up with some others.Christopher A. PosnerYes. Annabel, I mean CSL Vifor is doing a really nice job of really working the entire top down, bottom-up stakeholder base. So they have a series of tactics that they've employed from peer-to-peer programs to direct-to-patient initiatives. And I'd also mention at Fresenius, right? I mean the Fresenius sales force is actually engaged as well, and they've deployed their sales force to activate the clinics and really drive utilization. And the punchline there is that we're seeing increases in the number of clinics actually starting patients on therapy, and that's now 1,500, and that's up quite significantly versus Q4, and we're seeing a number of those clinics at Fresenius draw down that inventory and starting to kind of get in that reorder mode. So the things that CSL Vifor is doing is really starting to pay dividends as they're building this market.Annabel Eva SamimyOkay. Got it. And if I'm not sure if you could give us this level of details. But when a clinic starts using, they get Fresenius starts getting someone on board and they start using it. Are you noticing any pattern once they start? Are they pretty sticky? And those are the ones that start reordering it? Or is it still a little bit touch and go there?Christopher A. PosnerWell, we see across the board, Annabel, that there's really strong buy-in once these clinics start using the product. And I say that there's 2 metrics I look at. Anecdotally, we hear from the sales force and we hear actually from provider testimonials as well as patient testimonials that the product is really performing nicely. But the key metric that we look at is around reorders. And the majority of clinics that start reorder the product on a continual basis. And it becomes a growth annuity, if you will. And that's really what we're seeing in the data, and that's why we're encouraged.Annabel Eva SamimyOkay. Great. So yes, that's actually helpful. And I'm going to throw a question out there to Jo, just one about the development program. So on oral disease. So NP or in notalgia paresthetica has not been an indication with a tremendous amount of development. So what are your expectations for how rapid enrollment could be here essentially as the first treatment with no real competing programs?Joana GoncalvesThanks, Annabel. I think we're very confident about the program. Certainly, the New Entrant Journal was very helpful for us. And as we're in the operational phase and just having -- looking at stats to come on is many sites are very interested in participating, which completes our Phase II study, where it was really starting to kick this program off. It was not as well sort of received as it is now. So I think that's very helpful for sure. And as we've said before, dermatologists are the physicians who see these patients. So we remain encouraged and very confident about the time lines that we have put out for enrolling these patients.Annabel Eva SamimyOkay. And are these patients pretty concentrated among certain physicians or kind of scattered?Joana GoncalvesNot that we've seen to date. So of course, this is a program that will be a little bit bigger than our Phase II study. So we are having more sites on board and just to try and meet those time lines as well. So we're not concentrating in any particular area, but going quite broadly.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of David Amsellem of Piper Sandler.David A. AmsellemSo I wanted to drill down on more on your comments on DaVita. And I think, Chris, in the past, you've said that DaVita tends to have a slower process in terms of activating accounts. I'm just wondering if you could comment qualitatively on what you're seeing out of DaVita. Are you surprised that the number of clinics that have ordered is that 11%? And what is your partner doing to try to jump start that -- that's number one. And then secondly, can you just comment, if you can, on pricing across Europe and Rest of World and relative to what we have in the United States.Christopher A. PosnerYes. David, let me tackle the last one. It's a briefer conversation. So in Europe, we have a public price in Germany that I may have mentioned in the Q4 print, hopefully, it did. And that price is EUR 50 per vial. So by and large, it's about 1/3 of the price of the vial in the U.S., which is 150 list price. So it gives you a sense, and that's what I could speak to publicly around Germany. And each country, obviously, will work with their national bodies to secure price and reimbursement as they come online. Your first question around DaVita. Yes, I have alluded to it before. I mean, they have a different way they adopt new products. They tend to take a more phased approach where they try to gain real-world experience in a more concentrated area of the country, and then they roll it out nationally. It's available nationally now, and you are starting to see a pickup in the number of clinics dosing of patients. I would say this, David. DaVita is a priority for us and our commercial partner. From my experience, it's really not that unusual for 2 different customers to do things a little differently.And certainly, DaVita Fresenius are doing things a little differently. DaVita doesn't have the luxury of an internal sales force. And one thing that we see with DaVita that's different than Fresenius is the ability to access the clinics. And that is a critical factor in driving utilization and educating renal nurses, educating the lab techs, educating dietitians and social workers are a critical piece of the puzzle. And at DaVita, you mentioned what's our partner doing? Well, they're doing a series of things. They have to be a bit more creative and there's some lasting effects from the pandemic, given these access restrictions. So we've learned a lot around engaging via digital means, engaging at conferences, and that's exactly what CSL Vifor's doing. I think the significant point here is that, yes, they're a little behind Fresenius, clearly. But we are seeing month-to-month pickups in the number of new clinics ordering. And I always come back to this, David, that one of the most important things that is really encouraging to us and our partner is that once the clinic starts to utilize the product, given the patient testimonials and provider testimonials that really generates significant reorders. And over 70% of the DaVita clinics that are ordering continue to reorder. So it's a really nice growth annuity.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Jason Gerberry of Bank of America Securities.Unidentified AnalystThis is [Chi] on for Jason. I guess first one on IV KORSUVA. You gave some at 64% of the order came from Kapruvia as the rest of feeder and other clinics. Obviously, trend compared to the past 2 quarters, you might have given some metrics around that part of me if I missed it earlier. And regarding how we should think about the timing on when sales will converge with the underlying demand? I think you talked about the inventory is expected to be drawn down by midyear. But what's your latest thoughts on when sales will converge with the underlying demand? And maybe my second one on oral KORSUVA. Can you walk us through the scenario with the internal readout -- the comfort that internal readout that we can expect for the AD trial in fourth quarter?Christopher A. PosnerSure, Chi. Let me unpack that. Let me first speak to the evolution of demand orders. That was the first part of your question. Yes, we did mention this quarter, 46,000 vials are ordered from the dialysis clinics and roughly 65% or 64% were driven by Fresenius ordered by Fresenius. And you asked how that compares over the last 2 quarters. Given kind of what Fresenius did in Q3, Chi as you're aware, they did a significant stocking order. So the primary driver of the Q3, I think there was 184,000 vials. That was pretty much all Fresenius, about $180,000 of that was to Fresenius. And then in Q4, they're obviously starting to utilize that product. So the 21,000 vials used I would say, probably about 40%, 45% was Fresenius and the rest was split between DaVita and the midsize and independent DOs. So our expectation moving forward is it would be probably more akin to what we're seeing in fourth quarter where percentage will be the key driver, at least in 2023 in terms of vials order demand.Â Your second question around the normalization of demand and sales. Yes, we mentioned that by midyear, we would expect the majority of FMC clinics to have kind of drawn down, utilize their inventory and what I'd say, be in reorder mode. So I would say probably as we get into the second half of the year, you'll start to see sales and demand sort of converge. And then the last part of your question, let me give that to Jo around the oral.Joana GoncalvesSo as a reminder, Part A is what we are currently enrolling. And we have 280 patients that we will be enrolling in this Part A. Just as a reminder, this is an appropriate number of patients that will give us the information to continue into Part B or kind 2. And so what we'll be specifically looking at is looking at the dose as well as the sample size. And we will look at all the data that we will get. So specifically looking at efficacy and safety to be able to select the most favorable dose that demonstrates the best benefit risk profile, and we will be able to assess the sample size. So that's what we will be specifically focusing on and sharing for Part A.Unidentified AnalystIf I can clarify is that to a logo decision baked in there? Or is this just basically determining the dose selection that fabless heading into Part B?Joana GoncalvesWell, we are looking exactly for the dose in the sample size, but we will be reviewing the data and assessing what the outcome of the data demonstrates and assessing whether to move forward or not, of course. Yes.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line Sumant Kulkarni of Canaccord Genuity.Sumant Satchidanand KulkarniTo the details of some of the current market dynamics. Do you expect your partner to hit steady state operating margins on this product before TDAPA ends? And how important would that be for that to happen so you could start realizing substantial collaboration revenues?Christopher A. PosnerSumant, maybe you could clarify. You're asking me, it was a little muffled to my friend. So you're asking me to comment on the operating margins of CSL Vifor for this product?Sumant Satchidanand KulkarniSo not specifically any quantitative, but how important would it be for the product to hit a steady state operating margin before TDAPA ends, I guess, the question...Ryan D. MaynardI don't... Maybe -- are you focused on utilization... Utilization is...Sumant Satchidanand KulkarniNot really. I mean like for example, if the product is in launch mode for a longer time than otherwise thought, wouldn't that impact the rate of collaboration revenue that you recognized and that flows down to your bottom line. That's why I was asking I got it.Christopher A. PosnerYes. So he's asking about the profit split, right? Maybe you can it's agnostic to that.Ryan D. MaynardYes. I think the guidance that I've given on how the profit split works, which is we get roughly 46% of every dollar. And the mix between Fresenius and DaVita, more Fresenius, more DaVita fluctuates that percentage by maybe 1 or 2 points. So it's really not material. So it's going to be pretty steady from that point of view.Christopher A. PosnerYes. And Sumant, I just commented like on the marketing expense line on their controllable expenses from a CSL Vifor that doesn't necessarily impact that profit split.Ryan D. MaynardYes. It's pretty fixed, Sumant.Sumant Satchidanand KulkarniRight. Right. Now I'm talking about absolute dollars more than the profit split.OperatorAt this time, I'd like to turn the call back to Christopher Posner for closing remarks. Sir?Christopher A. PosnerThanks, Latif. Yes, I just want to take a minute just to wrap things up. I said in my comments, if you look at the key performance indicators of the business, specifically with KORSUVA injections, and we're encouraged. I mean CSL Vifor continues to make progress building this market. It's really reflected in the key trends this quarter. Clinic orders doubled. 60% of the FMC clinics are dosing a patient, and each segment is really seeing increases in clinic orders. So it is encouraging. And we're getting very positive feedback from both patients and physicians on the product. And that's really translating into very strong reorder rates. Again, very positive in terms of where we are. We continue to make really good progress, and Jo mentioned a little of that in our pipeline to our stated commitments. So net-net, we look really forward to continuing to update you on the progress of the KORSUVA launch and our pipeline as we progress. So with that, I'll end the call.OperatorThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.]"

Recently, VMC's 50-day simple moving average broke out above its 200-day moving average; this is known as a ""golden cross.""Considered an important signifier for a bullish breakout, a golden cross is a technical chart pattern that's formed when a stock's short-term moving average breaks above a longer-term moving average; the most common crossover involves the 50-day and the 200-day, since bigger time periods tend to form stronger breakouts.Golden crosses have three key stages that investors look out for. It starts with a downtrend in a stock's price that eventually bottoms out, followed by the stock's shorter moving average crossing over its longer moving average and triggering a trend reversal. The final stage is when a stock continues the upward climb to higher prices.A golden cross contrasts with a death cross, another widely-followed chart pattern that suggests bearish momentum could be on the horizon.VMC has rallied 14.1% over the past four weeks, and the company is a #1 (Strong Buy) on the Zacks Rank at the moment. This combination indicates VMC could be poised for a breakout.Once investors consider VMC's positive earnings outlook for the current quarter, the bullish case only solidifies. No earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months compared to 7 revisions higher, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased as well.Moving Average Chart for VMCInvestors should think about putting VMC on their watchlist given the ultra-important technical indicator and positive move in earnings estimates.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With an economic slowdown that is impacting its top lines and manufacturing, 3M (NYSE: MMM) is also dealing with a corporate restructuring and lawsuits that could even cost the company its Dow Jones spot.Firing Of Recently Promoted Chief Business OfficerOnly a month after his promotion, longtime executive Michael Val was fired on Friday due to’’inappropriate personal conduct and violation of company policy“.LayoffsOn April 25th, the diversified conglomerate announced it will be cutting 6,000 jobs across the globe as it works on lowering costs amid waning demand for electronics. At the beginning of the year, it already announced one round of layoffs that will impact 2,500 roles. With the most recent announcement, the total global workforce will be trimmed by 10%.The Restucturing PlanAs 3M continues its business journey by focusing on high-growth businesses, such as EVs and home improvement, while prioritizing emerging industries such as climate technology and next-generation electronics, 3M will be diluting management layers across all business functions and geographical locations.Along with trimming 8,500 jobs and leaning its corporate structure, 3M will also be simplifying its supply chain and adjust its marketing model.Total pretax restructuring charges are expected to be in the range between $700 million to $900 million, with half of them occurring this year, and the remaining next year. As a result of these actions, annual operating income is expected to improve also by the above range.To sum up, the restructuring plan reflects management is coming to terms with the reality and doing what is necessary to deal with sluggish volume growth.Quarter ResultsConsidering 3M makes electronic displays for smartphones and tablets, the fact alone that the consumer electronics business fell 35% in the first quarter is concerning to say the least. But the latest report for the quarter that ended on March 31st at least topped estimates as adjusted profit amounted to $1.97 per share topping analysts' expectations of $1.58 per share that Refinitiv gathered, with revenue of $8.03 billion also surpassing estimates of $7.49 billion.Story continuesBut figures alone were not what caught the market’s attention, but rather the announced turnaround plan that gave hope of 3M’s business portfolio being better utilized.Monsters In The Closet- The PFAS NightmareAlong with poor macroeconomic conditions, there's also the risk of legal liability from PFAS manufacturing, among other issues. Even The Coca Cola Company (NYSE: KO) got sued at the beginning of the year over claims its juice contained forever chemicals. Coca Cola advertised its Simply Tropical juice as „all natural“ with the lawsuit claiming that what Coca Cola actually did was deceive its customers with allegations of this production being made from natural ingredients. Third party testing has revealed that the Coca Cola Company orange drink that was portrayed as being all natural contained high levels of undisclosed PFAS, at levels hundreds of times greater than federal limits for drinking water. By 2025, 3M promised to stop making these man-made forever chemicals. But considering the harm made by these chemicals, this could be considered by many as too late. Not to mention the fact that this discontinuation represents a financial hit in the range between $1.3 billion to $2.3 billion, which is a small of its corporate revenue. By the looks of it, as diversified as its business model is, 3M is being pushed from all sides to dramatically change its identity.The Need To EvolveIn order to navigate a slow macroenvironment, 3M is adjusting its cost structure. Undoubtedly, 2023 will be challenging. 3M's R&amp;D hasn't generated the products to be able to boost volume and expand margins in recent years. 3M’s pricing power is no longer strong as it was.3M is a company that is cost-structured for volume growth and that expansion has not been happening lately, so undoubtedly something big needs to change. Even ODP is transitioning away from the traditional commercial business towards a B2B product and services. In its latest earnings report, ODP showed that revenue from business solutions managed to offset the decline in retail revenue. ODP CEO Gerry Smith believes that the recently segmented four units, among which is Office Depot, allowed the company to utilize its assets better and therefore, unlock its potential.GE Diversified A Bit BetterWhile 3M is aggressively lowering costs, General Electric (NYSE: GE) started 2023 strong. Moreover, General Electric reported its first free positive free cashflow in nearly a decade. Partially owing to the strength of its core aerospace division, General Electric posted stronger-than-expected first-quarter earnings, while also boosting its full-year profit and cash flow guidance. General Electric is also making efforts to make its operations leaner and sharpen its focus, but it is also enjoying robust market demand.It certainly doesn't help that 3M’s management got known for being overly optimistic with guidance, but at the very least, it is at least taking action so hopefully, 2024 gets to be the year of good earnings growth.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. This means that investors who purchase Valero Energy's shares on or after the 22nd of May will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 22nd of June.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.02 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$4.08 per share. Last year's total dividend payments show that Valero Energy has a trailing yield of 3.7% on the current share price of $109.64. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. View our latest analysis for Valero Energy Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Valero Energy paid out just 11% of its profit last year, which we think is conservatively low and leaves plenty of margin for unexpected circumstances. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. The good news is it paid out just 11% of its free cash flow in the last year.It's positive to see that Valero Energy's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. That's why it's comforting to see Valero Energy's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 33% per annum for the past five years. Valero Energy earnings per share have been sprinting ahead like the Road Runner at a track and field day; scarcely stopping even for a cheeky ""beep-beep"". We also like that it is reinvesting most of its profits in its business.'The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Valero Energy has delivered an average of 19% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. It's exciting to see that both earnings and dividends per share have grown rapidly over the past few years.Final TakeawayShould investors buy Valero Energy for the upcoming dividend? We love that Valero Energy is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. These characteristics suggest the company is reinvesting in growing its business, while the conservative payout ratio also implies a reduced risk of the dividend being cut in the future. Overall we think this is an attractive combination and worthy of further research.In light of that, while Valero Energy has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. To help with this, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Valero Energy that you should be aware of before investing in their shares.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

Improved productivity and cost-saving plans bode well. This led to robust top and bottom-line surprise trends for the third consecutive quarter in third-quarter fiscal 2023.Earnings of $1.37 per share increased 3% from $1.33 per share in the year-ago quarter. The figure also beat our estimate of earnings of $1.32 per share. Currency-neutral core earnings per share (EPS) rose 13% year over year. The company reported net sales of $20,068 million, up 4% year over year. Sales surpassed our estimate of $18,824.6 million. The increase in sales can be attributed to growth across all segments. Currency impacted net sales by 4%.The company witnessed continued strong momentum in the fiscal third quarter as reflected by underlying strength in brands and appropriate strategies, which aided organic sales growth. On an organic basis (excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange), revenues improved 7%, backed by a 10% rise in pricing and a 1% gain from a positive product mix, offset by a 3% decline in volume. All the company’s business segments reported growth in organic sales. The company’s organic sales grew, driven by robust pricing and a favorable mix, along with strength across segments.Procter &amp; Gamble remains focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. The company’s continued investment in the business alongside efforts to offset macro cost headwinds and balance top and bottom-line growth underscores its productivity efforts. PG is witnessing cost savings and efficiency improvements across all facets of the business.During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the company’s gross margin was aided by 210 basis points (bps) of gross productivity savings, while the operating margin included productivity savings of 290 bps. SG&amp;A expenses in the quarter reflected productivity savings of 80 bps.Consequently, the gross margin increased 150 bps to 48.2%. The currency-neutral gross margin improved 220 bps to 48.9%. Also, the operating margin rose 40 bps from the prior year to 21.2%. On a currency-neutral basis, the operating margin expanded 160 bps to 22.4%.Driven by these factors, management raised its sales view for fiscal 2023. For fiscal 2023, the company now anticipates year-over-year all-in sales growth of 1%, compared with down 1% to flat stated earlier. Organic sales are likely to increase 6% in fiscal 2023 versus the 4-5% growth mentioned earlier. We estimate the company’s all-in sales to grow 1.1% year over year to $80,979.5 million in fiscal 2023, with organic sales estimated to increase 6%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchShares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have gained 11.5% in the past three months, compared with the industry’s 10.1% growth.However, the company has been reeling under supply-chain issues, higher transportation costs, geopolitical challenges, currency headwinds and rising inflation which have been impacting consumer confidence. The company expects reported EPS to be flat to up 4% from $5.81 reported in fiscal 2022. The company expects EPS at the low end of the range due to the impacts of ongoing commodity and material cost headwinds, and currency impacts.The current earnings view includes after-tax impacts of $1.3 billion related to unfavorable currency movements and $2.2 billion of impacts of higher commodity and material costs. This equates to a $3.5-billion after-tax impact on net income, implying a $1.40-per-share impact on EPS or a 24-percentage-point headwind on EPS growth.Also, the unfavorable foreign currency remains concerning. Notably, currency fluctuations hurt sales by 4% and earnings by 16 cents per share in third-quarter fiscal 2023. SG&amp;A expense rate reflected adverse impacts of foreign currency of 0.5% in the fiscal third quarter. Currency movements are expected to negatively impact all-in sales growth by 5% in fiscal 2023.ConclusionDespite cost headwinds and currency woes, robust pricing, strength across segments and productivity efforts bode well and will likely help PG stay afloat. Also, a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.1% raises optimism about the stock. Topping it, the earnings estimates for fiscal 2023 have moved up 0.3% in the past 30 days.Other Stocks to ConsiderWe have highlighted some other top-ranked stocks from the broader Consumer Staples space, namely Clorox CLX, Conagra Brands CAG and Church &amp; Dwight Co.

Moreover, the figure declined 24.1% year over year.Quarterly results display better-than-anticipated revenues aided by healthy leasing activity.

That is because the Jun 16, 2023 $5 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for The Macerich Company shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, The Macerich Company is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry that ranks in the Top 46% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has moved from 44 cents per share to 41 cents.Given the way analysts feel about The Macerich Company right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

That's one takeaway from Home Depot's uninspired first-quarter results.""The size of the projects are getting a bit smaller,"" Home Depot (HD) CEO Ted Decker told analysts on the company's first quarter earnings call Monday.""It could be that the projects [are] being deferred or it could be that the project is being broken up into chunks,"" Decker said. ""Rather than do an entire room or an entire basement, you start working it in smaller chunks and that clearly impacts items per basket in overall activity.""On a yearly basis, customer transactions slid 4.8%, but came in better than Wall Street’s call for a 5.36% drop. Customers also spent less per ticket than anticipated, recording a 0.2% gain against expectations of a 2.63% boost in average ticket sizes.Big-ticket transactions, or those over $1,000, were down 6.5% compared with the first quarter of last year. Customers also shied away from flooring, kitchen, and bath during the quarter, another potential signal that they are downsizing projects.DIY customers also outperformed the professionals sector as demand shifted toward smaller projects, Home Depot said.That jibes with other research on remodeling.Aerial view of The Home Depot store and parking lot in San Diego, California, USA. Home Depot is the largest home improvement retailer and construction service in the US. (Thomas De Wever via Getty Images)John Burns Research and Consulting's remodeler index survey noted this home improvement softness in its April report. Just over half of remodelers surveyed said first quarter projects were smaller in scope because of less extensive work, while 20% said customers would rather tackle the project themselves than hire a professional.Similarly, home remodeling is expected to drop by early next year, according to the Leading Indicator of Remodeling Activity (LIRA) released in April by the Remodeling Futures Program at the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University.LIRA projected that year-over-year expenses for homeowner improvements and maintenance will result in a 2.8% drop through the first quarter of 2024.Story continues""Higher interest rates and sharp downturns in homebuilding and existing home sales are driving our projections for sluggish remodeling activity next year,"" Abbe Will, senior research associate and associate project director at the Remodeling Futures Program, wrote in a blog post last month. ""With ongoing uncertainty in financial markets and the threat of a recession, homeowners are increasingly likely to pare back or delay projects beyond necessary replacements and repairs.""(Photo: Getty Creative) (Vincent Ricardel via Getty Images)Home prices and higher mortgage rates may also play a role in where remodeling activity goes.""There's generally a lag effect to home price appreciation or depreciation,"" Decker said. ""I think the difference here is how sensitive are people going to be. [They were] up 45% in home value from the end of 2019, [and] now month over month, the values are off slightly, but still up 40% or 38% from where it was at the end of 2019.""And home prices have started to rise again on a monthly basis after contracting some this winter. Meanwhile, executives touched on the locked-in effect that many homeowners — who may have listed their homes under more favorable interest rate conditions — are feeling.""In this environment, if you have a low fixed rate mortgage, and let's just remind ourselves, 40% of owner-occupied homes are owned outright. And of the households that hold the mortgage, close to 90% of those hold fixed rate mortgages under 5%. So with mortgage rates where they are today, there's a reluctance to sell your home, and there is a greater incentive to stay in place and improve in place,"" Home Depot CFO Richard McPhail said on the call.""You're spending more time at home and that home is getting older and you do not have an incentive to sell and take on a higher rate mortgage,"" he said.

We'll need to take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Right now, both Loma Negra Compania Industrial Argentina S.A. Sponsored ADR and D.R. Horton are sporting a Zacks Rank of # 1 (Strong Buy). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that these stocks have improving earnings outlooks. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.LOMA currently has a forward P/E ratio of 5.46, while DHI has a forward P/E of 9.98. We also note that LOMA has a PEG ratio of 0.17. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. DHI currently has a PEG ratio of 0.64.Another notable valuation metric for LOMA is its P/B ratio of 0.97. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, DHI has a P/B of 1.77.Story continuesThese metrics, and several others, help LOMA earn a Value grade of A, while DHI has been given a Value grade of C.Both LOMA and DHI are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that LOMA is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Macy's (M) earns a Zacks Rank #3 16 days from its next quarterly earnings release on June 1, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.47 a share.M has an Earnings ESP figure of 2.81%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.47 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.46.M is one of just a large database of Retail-Wholesale stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY).O'Reilly Automotive is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on July 26, 2023. ORLY's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $9.98 a share 71 days from its next earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for O'Reilly Automotive is $9.96, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 0.27%.Story continuesM and ORLY's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

PGRTX has a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 1 (Strong Buy), which is based on various forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.History of Fund/ManagerPGRTX finds itself in the Principal Financial Group family, based out of Des Moines, IA. The Principal Small Cap Growth I Institutional made its debut in September of 2002 and PGRTX has managed to accumulate roughly $141.74 million in assets, as of the most recently available information. Randy Welch is the fund's current manager and has held that role since June of 2009.PerformanceObviously, what investors are looking for in these funds is strong performance relative to their peers. This fund in particular has delivered a 5-year annualized total return of 7.18%, and it sits in the middle third among its category peers. Investors who prefer analyzing shorter time frames should look at its 3-year annualized total return of 8.35%, which places it in the bottom third during this time-frame.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. Over the past three years, PGRTX's standard deviation comes in at 21.16%, compared to the category average of 16.57%. The standard deviation of the fund over the past 5 years is 23.4% compared to the category average of 16.45%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.Risk FactorsThe fund has a 5-year beta of 1.1, so investors should note that it is hypothetically more volatile than the market at large. Alpha is an additional metric to take into consideration, since it represents a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark, which in this case, is the S&amp;P 500. With a negative alpha of -3.96, managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.Story continuesHoldingsInvestigating the equity holdings of a mutual fund is also a valuable exercise. This can show us how the manager is applying their stated methodology, as well as if there are any inherent biases in their approach. For this particular fund, the focus is largely on equities that are traded in the United States.Right now, 96.4% of this mutual fund's holdings are stocks, which have an average market capitalization of $5.27 billion. The fund has the heaviest exposure to the following market sectors:TechnologyHealthIndustrial CyclicalOtherTurnover is about 50.7%, so those in charge of the fund make fewer trades than comparable funds.ExpensesAs competition heats up in the mutual fund market, costs become increasingly important. Compared to its otherwise identical counterpart, a low-cost product will be an outperformer, all other things being equal. Thus, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is vital for investors. In terms of fees, PGRTX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.94% compared to the category average of 1.19%. From a cost perspective, PGRTX is actually cheaper than its peers.Investors need to be aware that with this product, the minimum initial investment is $0; each subsequent investment has no minimum amount.Bottom LineOverall, Principal Small Cap Growth I Institutional ( PGRTX ) has a high Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively similar performance, worse downside risk, and lower fees, this fund looks like a great potential choice for investors right now.Your research on the Mutual Fund Equity Report segment doesn't have to stop here.

As of May, Fisher’s real-time net worth stands at $6.7 billion.High interest rates have been a cause of worry for investors this year as interest rates reached their 16-year high. The Fed’s efforts to fight inflation have had significant impacts on the investment strategies of investors in the US. According to Fisher, Fed decisions do not have a long-term impact on the stock market’s performance. He thinks investors should follow their long-term investment strategy by avoiding short-term volatility caused by continuous interest rate hikes.Recently, Fisher Investments announced that it would relocate its corporate headquarters to Texas, following Washington’s supreme court ruling which upheld that the capital gains tax is constitutional on the state’s wealthiest residents, according to a report by Bloomberg.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is a provider of health care solutions including prescription medicines, vaccines, biologic therapies, animal health and consumer care products. Shares have benefited from investors seeking safety in areas with less economic and interest rate sensitivity. With about one third of its sales generated by blockbuster oncology drug Keytruda, the key issue for investors is the success of its large R&amp;D pipeline to replace those sales when Keytruda comes off patent in 2028. However, Merck seems to be getting little credit from investors for the 60+ programs it has in clinical development, despite having several solid and large new product opportunities. Additionally, the company’s strong balance sheet and robust free cash flow provide it multiple options for future partnerships and acquisitions, besides return of capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases.”14.

The actual card is fairly sleek (as you can see below), as customers names are etched into an Apple titanium card. The no-fee card generated a lot of hype, as many early users were quick to post their latest card on various social media sites.The initial goal of Marcus (back in 2016) was to leverage Goldman’s wonderful name brand and build a full-service digital bank. This card was a large piece of GS’s ambitions to grow its retail banking franchise called Marcus. After 5 years, Marcus now has 14 million customers and $16 billion in loan balances. Surprisingly, Marcus now represents nearly 20% of the firm’s total revenue.We thought it would be interesting to look how the Apple Card is doing in terms of loans and exposures. With over $100 billion in assets, this has been a successful source of cheap deposits for GS. Despite having an institutional / “white shoe” brand in the investment banking and trading world, GS’s Apple Card has been a disappointment.” (Click here to read the full text)11.

MS is a leading investment bank and wealth management firm with approximately $5 trillion of client assets under management. It merged Citigroup’s Smith Barney business into its own wealth management business after the 2008 recession/financial crisis, which resulted in a more stable business model. Recent acquisitions of asset manager Eaton Vance and E-Trade provide additional stability and higher returns on capital. We believe MS has a sustainable competitive advantage due to its size and scale, global reach, strong reputation, and financial distribution capabilities. Importantly for a financial institution, it is in good financial health as key leverage ratios including common equity Tier 1 ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio, Tier 1 leverage ratio, and supplementary leverage ratio were all well above required minimums at the end of 2021.Our thesis on MS is that its wealth management business will continue to become a larger part of the overall company, which will increase overall margins and return on equity (ROE). Wealth management and asset management are less cyclical than investment banking, and often generate higher margins and provide better stability of financial results. For example, the addition of Smith Barney added significant scale and boosted wealth management operating margins from below 10% into the mid-20%s over the past several years while also increasing returns on equity. Looking ahead, we believe the company will benefit from rising asset prices and higher interest rates, should they happen over time…” (Click here to see the full text)9. Caterpillar Inc.

Over the last 50 years, global personal consumer expenditures (PCE) has grown 7-9% annualized. We expect 4-5% long-term PCE growth going forward. Additionally, the shift from cash to credit continues unabated, with a total credit penetration of only approximately 50% globally.3 This shift provides Visa and Mastercard with another ~4-6% of growth. When combined with PCE, this gives both companies high-single-digit to low-double[1]digit revenue growth opportunities. This growth estimate is before accounting for growth amplifiers like the acceleration of e[1]commerce, the shift from offline to online, and additional services. Both companies enjoy extremely strong network effects that provide strong competitive advantages.We have trimmed Visa and Mastercard because their combined weight grew to over 12% of the Global Growth Portfolio because of their recent performance and to fund our increase in Amazon’s position size. We added to both positions when their prices were depressed due to cross-border transactions deteriorating materially from the pandemic. Cross-border volumes came roaring back when travel corridors reopened, and although we are several quarters removed from the cross-border nadir, Visa still grew volumes &gt;30% in 1Q23. Total cross-border volumes are now 132% of 2019 levels. At 4.5% each, both companies remain high conviction positions for Global Growth.”7.

However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. In this article, we decided to focus on Regeneron Pharmaceuticals'  ROE.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals is:18% = US$4.2b ÷ US$23b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.18 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.A Side By Side comparison of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' Earnings Growth And 18% ROETo start with, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' ROE looks acceptable. Yet, the fact that the company's ROE is lower than the industry average of 23% does temper our expectations. Still, we can see that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has seen a remarkable net income growth of 27% over the past five years. We reckon that there could be other factors at play here. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place. However, not to forget, the company does have a decent ROE to begin with, just that it is lower than the industry average. So this also does lend some color to the high earnings growth seen by the company.Story continuesNext, on comparing Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 32% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is REGN fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Regeneron Pharmaceuticals doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, meaning that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company has seen significant growth in its earnings backed by a respectable ROE and a high reinvestment rate. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

367,b8776a33-0454-3bb4-8851-a8b3f3874d51,UNP,2023-05-17,Is Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) A Risky Investment?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/union-pacific-nyse-unp-risky-120019799.html,1684324819,STORY,['UNP'],"[David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. We can see that Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) does use debt in its business. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.When Is Debt A Problem?Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. Check out our latest analysis for Union Pacific What Is Union Pacific's Debt?The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at March 2023 Union Pacific had debt of US$33.6b, up from US$31.9b in one year. However, it does have US$1.08b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$32.5b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Strong Is Union Pacific's Balance Sheet?We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Union Pacific had liabilities of US$6.21b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$47.3b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$1.08b in cash and US$1.96b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$50.5b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.This deficit isn't so bad because Union Pacific is worth a massive US$120.0b, and thus could probably raise enough capital to shore up its balance sheet, if the need arose. But it's clear that we should definitely closely examine whether it can manage its debt without dilution.Story continuesWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.With net debt to EBITDA of 2.7 Union Pacific has a fairly noticeable amount of debt. On the plus side, its EBIT was 7.5 times its interest expense, and its net debt to EBITDA, was quite high, at 2.7. Importantly Union Pacific's EBIT was essentially flat over the last twelve months. We would prefer to see some earnings growth, because that always helps diminish debt. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Union Pacific can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Union Pacific produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 63% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.Our ViewBoth Union Pacific's ability to to convert EBIT to free cash flow and its interest cover gave us comfort that it can handle its debt. On the other hand, its net debt to EBITDA makes us a little less comfortable about its debt. When we consider all the factors mentioned above, we do feel a bit cautious about Union Pacific's use of debt. While we appreciate debt can enhance returns on equity, we'd suggest that shareholders keep close watch on its debt levels, lest they increase. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.

These companies focus on providing logistics and supply-chain expertise services. While freight constitutes a significant chunk of revenues, some of these companies also derive a small portion of their top line from other rail-related services, including third-party railcar and locomotive repairs, routine land sales and container sales, among others. A few companies offer service to multiple production and distribution facilities. Besides locomotives, some of these companies own equipment of leased locomotives, railcars etc.Factors Relevant to the Industry's FortunesFocus on Cost Cuts to Drive the Bottom Line: The industry has been experiencing significant levels of inflation, including higher prices for labor, freight and fuel. The industry players are focusing on cost-cutting measures and making efforts to improve productivity and efficiency to mitigate high expenses and the effects of a weaker-than-expected demand scenario.Economic Uncertainty: Despite a strong performance by major indices lately, the fact remains that we are by no means out of the woods, especially with respect to inflation-related woes. The recent production cut by the OPEC+ oil cartel, which includes OPEC members plus Russia, has led to a surge in oil prices. This may aggravate inflationary pressure and result in heightened economic uncertainty and market volatility. The turmoil in the banking sector — popularly known as the engine of economic growth — also does not bode well.Story continuesWeak Freight Demand: Risks associated with an economic slowdown, geopolitical tensions and supply-chain woes dampen the prospects of stocks belonging to this industrial cohort. Due to the uncertainty, the Cass Freight Index declined 1% on a month-on-month basis in March. In fact, the index has declined month on month in six out of the last seven months. The slowdown in freight demand does not bode well for railroad operators.Zacks Industry Rank Signals Glum ProspectsThe Zacks Rail industry, housed within the broader Zacks Transportation sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #173. This rank places it in the bottom 31% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are pessimistic about this group’s earnings growth potential. The industry’s earnings estimates for 2023 have moved down 7.6% since May 2022.Despite the gloomy outlook, there are a couple of stocks worth watching in the industry. But before we present them, it is worth looking at the industry’s shareholder returns and current valuation first.Industry Lags S&amp;P 500 But Outperforms SectorOver the past year, the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry has declined 2.4% against the S&amp;P 500 composite’s gain of 3%. The broader sector has declined 3.4% in the said time frame.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationBased on the trailing 12-month price-to-book (P/B), a commonly used multiple for valuing railroad stocks, the industry is currently trading at 6.97X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 5.51X. It is also above the sector’s P/B ratio of 4.14X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 10.86X, as low as 5.69X and at the median of 8.08X.Price-to-Book Ratio 3 Stocks to Keep a Tab onAll three stocks mentioned below carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here   Union Pacific: Based in Omaha, NE, Union Pacific provides rail transportation services across the United States. Union Pacific's efforts to reward its shareholders, even in the current uncertain scenario, are impressive. In 2022, UNP bought back shares worth $6,282 million. The railroad operator paid dividends worth $3,159 million in 2022.UNP's strong free cash flow generating ability supports its shareholder-friendly activities. The uptick in overall volumes (up 2% year over year in 2002) is an added positive. Union Pacific has an encouraging track record with respect to earnings surprise, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the past four quarters (missing the mark in the other one). The average beat is 2.28%.Price and Consensus: UNPCSX: Based in Jacksonville, FL, CSX offers rail-based freight transportation services like traditional rail service, transport of intermodal containers and trailers apart from rail-to-truck transfers.CSX is trying to drive growth in this challenging environment by reducing operating expenses. Efforts to reward its shareholders also bode well. CSX has a stellar track record with respect to earnings surprise, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the past four quarters, by an average of 7.76%. Price and Consensus: CSXNorfolk Southern: We are impressed with Norfolk Southern's efforts to reward its shareholders through dividends and buybacks. In January 2023, the company's board announced a 9% uptick in its quarterly dividend payout to $1.35 per share. NSC's strong free cash flow generating ability supports NSC's shareholder-friendly activities.Norfolk Southern has an encouraging track record with respect to earnings surprise, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the past four quarters by an average of 4.66%.Price and Consensus: NSCWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Introduced by Executive Director and Human Resources Business Partner Ebony David, the series is meant to deepen awareness of implicit and unconscious bias in our work and interpersonal relationships. The first module was designed to develop a common understanding of diversity, equity, and inclusion among all employees, encourage self-reflection, and initiate meaningful conversations about how I&amp;D shows up at Quest.Module 2 spotlighted how understanding and addressing unconscious bias is crucial for supporting a collaborative work environment, building strong relationships, and breaking down barriers and stigmas.

It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. Importantly, Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.What Risk Does Debt Bring?Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together. View our latest analysis for Cisco Systems How Much Debt Does Cisco Systems Carry?The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Cisco Systems had debt of US$8.93b at the end of January 2023, a reduction from US$11.5b over a year. However, it does have US$22.1b in cash offsetting this, leading to net cash of US$13.1b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Strong Is Cisco Systems' Balance Sheet?We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Cisco Systems had liabilities of US$27.3b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$27.1b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$22.1b in cash and US$8.79b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$23.5b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.Of course, Cisco Systems has a titanic market capitalization of US$192.9b, so these liabilities are probably manageable. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward. Despite its noteworthy liabilities, Cisco Systems boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!Story continuesWhile Cisco Systems doesn't seem to have gained much on the EBIT line, at least earnings remain stable for now. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Cisco Systems's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. Cisco Systems may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. Happily for any shareholders, Cisco Systems actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT over the last three years. That sort of strong cash generation warms our hearts like a puppy in a bumblebee suit.Summing UpAlthough Cisco Systems's balance sheet isn't particularly strong, due to the total liabilities, it is clearly positive to see that it has net cash of US$13.1b. And it impressed us with free cash flow of US$15b, being 104% of its EBIT. So is Cisco Systems's debt a risk? It doesn't seem so to us. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. For example - Cisco Systems has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.If, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out our list of net cash growth stocks without delay.Have feedback on this article?

376,654feff9-b5f2-3fe0-b2f2-a928b33df3d1,CSCO,2023-05-17,DXC Technology (DXC) to Report Q4 Earnings: What's in Store?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dxc-technology-dxc-report-q4-112211442.html,1684236131,STORY,"['DXC', 'A', 'HPQ', 'CSCO']","[DXC Technology DXC is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results on May 18.For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the company anticipates revenues between $3.615 billion and $3.635 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter revenues stands at $3.62 billion, indicating a year-over-year decline of 9.6%.DXC anticipates non-GAAP earnings between $1.00 and $1.05 per share. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $1.02 per share, suggesting a 21.4% year-over-year increase.The company’s earnings outpaced estimates twice in the trailing four quarters while missing the same in the remaining two, with a negative average surprise of 1.8%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.DXC Technology Company. Price and EPS SurpriseDXC Technology Company. price-eps-surprise | DXC Technology Company. QuoteFactors to ConsiderDXC’s fiscal fourth-quarter performance is likely to have been negatively impacted by the business operation closure in Russia following the Kremlin force’s invasion of Ukraine. On its fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 earnings conference call, the company stated that the exit from Russia would reduce its total revenues by approximately $140 million in fiscal 2023.The strong U.S. dollar against major currencies and the concluded divestments of certain business units in the past 12 months are also anticipated to have negatively impacted the fiscal fourth-quarter top line. The company projected unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates would have a negative impact of 3.6% on its fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 revenue growth. Moreover, it projects that acquisitions and divestitures concluded in the past 12 months will have a negative impact of 3.1% on fourth-quarter sales.Moreover, a weak traditional business is likely to have weighed on the to-be-reported quarter's performance. However, sequential revenue stabilization is expected to have continued.The negative impacts of the aforementioned factors are likely to have been partially offset by DXC’s strength in the digital business and partnerships, which have been helping it expand in the cloud computing space. A modest increase in IT spending is anticipated to have contributed to the top line in the quarter to be reported.Story continuesMoreover, margins are forecast to have benefited from the company’s cost-saving initiatives and reduction in debts, which are likely to have lowered its interest expenses during the quarter. DXC projects the adjusted EBIT margin in the range of 8.7%-9.2% in the fiscal fourth quarter.What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for DXC this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.
