Can a bank crisis change that?,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/congress-hasnt-banned-lawmakers-from-trading-stocks-can-a-bank-crisis-change-that-122928914.html,1682771368,STORY,"['SIVBQ', 'SIVPQ', 'SCHW', 'MS']","[At least 9 lawmakers from both parties sold banking stocks during the financial turmoil in March, disclosures that are already renewing calls for an outright ban of Congressional stock trading.Notable traders include Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ), who sold Silicon Valley Bank stock after that bank had signaled deep trouble and one day before regulators seized the lender. There is also Rep. Jared Moskowitz (D-FL). An account linked to the freshman Congressman sold shares of Seacoast Banking Corporation (SBCF) just days before that stock tanked.Gottheimer and Moskowitz deny any impropriety and the transactions appear to be perfectly allowed within current law. Nevertheless, advocates of a ban say these trades further undermine the public's faith in Congress. The transactions have already spurred a demand for hearings on the issue.""I'm not at all surprised,"" said Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-VA) of the disclosures. She is the author of a letter this week calling for a public discussion of the trades.It’s become a familiar routine, Spanberger added in an interview this week, for a major news event to soon be followed by revelations of ""buying or selling by members of Congress in a way that looks as though it's connected.""Lawmakers in Washington are once again trying to stop their colleagues from trading stocks. (REUTERS/Jon Cherry) (Jon Cherry / reuters)The Virginia lawmaker is the co-author with Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX) of a bill that would require members of Congress as well as their family members to put their investments into a qualified blind trust. They have introduced their legislation in each of the last three sessions of Congress without success so far.One of the notable sponsors of her bill is Gottheimer, the lawmaker who disclosed his sale of Silicon Valley Bank stock. He has also disclosed a sale of Charles Schwab (SCHW) stock and a purchase of shares in Morgan Stanley (MS) during the turmoil.A representative for Gottheimer, when asked about the Silicon Valley Bank trade, pointed to a 2022 statement where the lawmaker said he was in the process of setting up a blind trust and had already turned over investment decisions to a third party.Story continues""I don’t believe Members of Congress, judges, or any government employee in a policy role, should be involved in the day-to-day trading of securities, including crypto currencies,"" he said then.A representative for Moskowitz didn't respond to a request for comment but the lawmaker told The New York Times that the Seacoast trade took place in an account set up for his children and had been suggested by a financial adviser. He also maintains that the sale happened before a congressional briefing on the turmoil that he has previously discussed attending.'Broad, growing momentum'There are at least 4 bills that have been introduced this Congress that would levy such a ban on lawmaker trading, including one unveiled last week called the Ending Trading and Holdings in Congressional Stocks (ETHICS) Act.That effort is being led by Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR) who said in a statement to Yahoo Finance that the reaction to last week's unveiling has shown ""broad, growing momentum"" adding that ""without action, we will only continue to hear of situations where lawmakers voted on bills while holding or trading stocks that could be affected.""Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR) speaks at a press conference on the introduction of the Senate ETHICS Act which would restrict members of Congress and their immediate family members from owning or trading stocks while serving in office. (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) (Anna Moneymaker via Getty Images)The current rules governing the trading of stocks by lawmakers were put in place when then-President Obama signed the STOCK Act of 2012. That legislation clarified that insider trading laws applied to lawmakers and also instituted the 45-day disclosure rule.Calls for an outright ban have intensified in the years since after a series of scandals. The most infamous incident came in 2020 when then Sens. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) and Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) sold an array of stocks after a private briefing on COVID-19 but before the larger public was fully aware of the coming pandemic.Burr faced a Justice Department investigation that eventually ended without charges and retired earlier this year while Loeffler lost her 2020 bid for election.Some have even launched ETFs that currently allow traders to invest like their lawmakers in a bid to bring attention to the issue.Congress seemed to be on the verge of taking action late last year before talks fell apart largely over the issue of whether to include Supreme Court justices in a ban.""We're not there just yet,"" says Donald Sherman, a deputy director at the watchdog group the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, of the political will for ban but says the selling that took place during the banking turmoil offers another opportunity for advocates to press their case.""Whether it’s the banking crisis scandal or the next one that will inevitably happen, eventually the problem will be too big, and the support for reform too strong, for leadership to continue to ignore.""'Do we want to take some action?'The various new bills seeking an outright ban are from lawmakers who hail from both parties.One from Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) is called the Preventing Elected Leaders from Owning Securities and Investments (PELOSI) Act to highlight the frequent trading activities of Paul Pelosi, the husband of Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi (D-CA).Another effort comes from Rep. Angie Craig (D-MN) who has a bill called the Halt Unchecked Member Benefits with Lobbying Elimination (HUMBLE) Act.Merkley's bill has the support of 21 Democratic senators and bipartisan support in the House with Reps. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL) and Michael Cloud (R-TX) pushing the effort there.U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-VA) talks to fellow representatives prior to a State of the Union address in 2023.

Roy currently has 56 co-sponsors from both parties and no word yet on whether any hearing will be in the offing but she maintains that things are moving ever so slowly in her direction.""Congress as an entity can make the choice: Do we want to keep having these embarrassing headlines that denigrate the public trust or do we want to take some action?"" she asked.Ben Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.Click here for politics news related to business and moneyRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"
1,a65a847d-0142-3318-b9cf-40a8f164bb74,USB,2023-04-30,3 Ridiculously Cheap Stocks for Bargain Hunters,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-ridiculously-cheap-stocks-bargain-190323238.html,1682449403,STORY,"['USB', 'CLFD']","[Hunting for cheap stocks is a good idea in the current environment, as many of these overlooked names have strong upside potential with little risk to the downside. Moreover, with a recession on the horizon later this year, I believe it’s time to take profits on many of the growth names that have rallied this year.Of course, the potential recession fears may be exaggerated and it will likely not happen in the next few months at least. But Wall Street should soon recognize that there are much better deals outside of the hottest tech companies. Many companies are starting to turn a corner as supply constraints ease and producer inflation falls considerably.Thus, here are three cheap stocks you should look into:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsClearfield (CLFD)llustrative Editorial of Clearfield Inc website homepage. Clearfield Inc logo visible on display screen.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comClearfield (NASDAQ:CLFD) is a company that designs, manufactures, and distributes fiber optic solutions for communications networks. The company serves customers in the broadband, wireless, cable TV, and utility sectors. Clearfield’s products include fiber management systems, fiber delivery platforms, fiber connectors, and fiber terminals.The stock of Clearfield seems very undervalued right now, given its impressive growth profile and low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 12.9x. The company reported a 68% year-over-year increase in revenue and a 37% surge in earnings fiscal first quarter of 2023. Despite the growth, the stock trades at a seemingly unjustified P/E ratio.Even though Clearfield’s growth will likely slow down this year due to some customers working through excess inventory, I believe the low valuation still remains compelling. The growth will likely return in the long run since Clearfield has a strong competitive advantage in the fiber optic market, which is expected to grow at a double-digit CAGR until 2027. Moreover, there has been a recent bout of institutional investors going heavy on this stock, with Legato and Kornitzer Capital buying just under 73,000 shares in the past week.Story continuesAll things considered, I think the company’s negatives are already priced in, and this stock has a lot of upside potential. Clearfield is one of the best cheap stocks to buy right now, offering a rare combination of growth and value. I will not be surprised if the stock reaches $100 or more by next year, as analysts have an average price target of $95.60, with a 125.37% upside potential.US Bancorp (USB)The logo for U.S. Bancorp's U.S. Bank is displayed on the side of a building.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comThe banking sector has been hit hard by the recent crisis that triggered a wave of panic and sell-offs. Among the victims was US Bancorp (NYSE:USB), one of the country’s largest and most stable banks. USB plunged nearly 50% from its high of $53.88 to its current level of around $33.But I think this is a great opportunity to buy USB stock at a huge discount. Here’s why.The fears about US Bancorp’s lack of capital seem overblown, at least when you look at it from a long-term perspective. The Holdco report that exposed the banks’ capital hole is also based on a worst-case scenario.In reality, the Federal Reserve is likely to step up its stress testing and regulatory measures to make sure no other banks fail. That will likely include some cost-cutting measures here, but US Bancorp has plenty of levers to boost its capital if needed. It can cut its dividend, which currently yields 6.07% or reduce its share buybacks. It also seems that management is aware of this problem and is working to fix it.When questioned about the buybacks and the 9% CET1 requirement, the CEO replied: “…I will tell you, as we all know, there’s a lot of capital changes that are likely to occur from a regulatory standpoint. So we’re not going to do anything until we have more clarity around that, which we hope to have in the second half of the year. But the focus on getting to the appropriate capital levels as quickly as possible, accreting capital and building that capital base is priority one.”With that in mind, and the banking crisis being largely contained by the Federal Reserve’s bailouts and interventions, I expect US Bancorp to recover from the temporary setback and resume its growth trajectory. Personally, I find USB to be one of the cheap stocks that looks very compelling and is worth the risk.Advance Auto Parts (AAP)The outside of an Advanced Auto Parts storefront.Source: James R. Martin / ShutterstockIf you’ve read my columns recently, you’ll likely notice that I’m very bullish on auto parts companies. And that’s for good reason since the U.S. civilian vehicle fleet continues to age rapidly, reaching 13.1 years for cars. Most middle-class families feel the crunch for cash and don’t have enough saved up for a new car. Additionally, the interest rates on car loans seem excessive at 5.5% on average.In that sort of environment, the best decision would be to simply repair what you have and wait until the economy gets better. Indeed, that’s what has been happening as auto parts companies are seeing rapid expansion and constant supply shortages due to high demand. It will be nearly a $1 trillion market by 2033.With that in mind, I believe Advance Auto Parts (NYSE:AAP) is among the strongest value picks. The stock changes hands at a 11.61x forward P/E ratio despite the double-digit 3-year growth rate and a robust $722 million operating cash flow allowing a 4.73% dividend yield on the stock. The tailwinds will likely carry it much higher in the long run.On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

7,06cd864b-eaef-3048-9fff-7981c8a39cf3,O,2023-04-30,Sunak is pulling the plug on the North Sea – watch UK oil drain away,The Telegraph,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sunak-pulling-plug-north-sea-050000991.html,1682830800,STORY,['CL=F'],"[Oil platform, Beatrice B (11/30) in the Moray Firth, Scotland - Rob Arnold / Alamy Stock PhotoAt its peak in the early 2000s, the North Sea oil and gas industry, centred on Aberdeen, delivered over 2.7m barrels of oil daily – a heady 3.6pc of global production. North Sea gas fields provided the equivalent of another 1.8m barrels on top of that.While production has since dropped sharply, with fewer than a million barrels of crude pumped daily, the UK’s oil and gas industry continues to employ 25,000 in and around Aberdeen and 200,000 more across the UK.More fundamentally, with tens of millions of petrol and diesel cars on the road and 85pc of homes relying on gas for heating, oil and gas still meet around three quarters of the UK’s total energy needs.Far better to pump our own hydrocarbons than relying on imports in an increasingly uncertain world.Renewables are clearly important – powering 36pc of UK electricity generation last year, up from 11pc a decade ago.But oil remains essential for transportation and a range of industrial processes. And gas-fired turbines generated 40pc of electricity used in the UK last year, up from 30pc in 2012.Even the Climate Change Committee, a government-created advisory body, acknowledges that oil and gas will still account for half the UK’s energy usage in the late 2030s. At a time when energy security has become critical, it makes economic and geostrategic sense to make the most of our own resources.Plus, using North Sea energy involves far fewer carbon emissions than doubling down on the UK’s sharply increased reliance on gas drilled in the US and Qatar.That gas is liquidised, pumped into massive diesel-powered ships then “regasified” after travelling thousands of miles to UK ports – a hugely energy-intensive series of processes.Environmentalists ignore such realities when they block roads and wreck high-profile sporting events, screaming for North Sea production immediately to cease.For all these reasons, the Government’s windfall tax on UK oil and gas producers is deeply counterproductive. Little more than a year ago, when other UK businesses paid 19pc corporation tax, North Sea producers were charged 30pc plus a 10pc “supplementary levy” on top.Story continuesSince then, tax on North Sea profits has risen from 40pc to 65pc and now 75pc – thanks to then Chancellor Rishi Sunak and his successor Jeremy Hunt. This windfall tax also now applies not until 2025, as originally announced, but until 2028.The Tories are keen to parade their green credentials – despite evidence even from the government’s own net-zero cheerleader that ongoing North Sea production will be environmentally useful for at least another decade and more.Ministers are also under the impression this windfall tax will raise lots of revenue, helping to plug the huge post-lockdown hole in our national accounts.Figures released last week showed that while government borrowing was £13.2bn less than expected over the last 12 months, the state still spent £139bn more than it raised during 2022/23 – a deficit £18bn up on the previous year.The UK is, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility, facing triple-digit deficits for several more years to come. That highlights the case not for sky-high taxation, but pro-growth policies to boost GDP, making the debt more manageable by expanding our economy.Sunak and Hunt have instead imposed the heaviest tax burden in 70 years – and who better to tax than those nasty North Sea oil and gas producers?This Tory windfall tax will raise an average of £8.6bn a year between now and 2028, says the OBR, up from £0.8bn on average during each of the six years until 2021. So, on official estimates, the tax burden on this single industry has risen almost eleven-fold, despite the glaringly obvious national interest in making sure North Sea production is preserved.Yes, crude prices rose after Putin invaded Ukraine last February, peaking at $138 a barrel the following month. During 2022 as a whole, oil averaged $101 – 40pc up on 2021.But the oil price didn’t rise 11-fold and the profits of UK energy firms certainly didn’t rise eleven-fold – so how is this tax hike justified?Some of the multinational oil majors still operating in the North Sea did indeed make vast headline profits as global energy prices went haywire last spring and summer.But they were overwhelmingly derived from non-UK operations, in parts of the world with much lower extraction costs.North Sea production is anyway now dominated by small, UK-centric independent operators.They lack the huge balance sheets of the global energy companies, so struggle to take advantage of the tax breaks that Chancellor Hunt claims will lead to greater investment.On the contrary, as I learned while visiting Aberdeen a few days ago, nine out of ten local operators have frozen their investment plans – and is it any wonder?Imagine taking on tens of millions of pounds of debt to launch a complex offshore drilling project, then the tax rate almost doubles – at a time when the cost of labour and materials is also spiralling.Harbour Energy, among the largest UK independents, made just £6.4m in post-tax profits last year – after setting aside a whopping £1.2bn (yes, billion!) for the so-called “energy profits levy”.Far from rolling in cash, Harbour has just announced 350 onshore job losses, mostly in Aberdeen. The UK oil and gas industry as a whole is meanwhile dealing with the worst strikes in a generation among offshore workers.North Sea operators have been lobbying the Treasury to set a “price floor” – so this eye-watering tax rate only applies when crude is above a certain level. They’ve been firmly rebuffed.But Hunt needs to understand that unless this 75pc tax rate is slashed, North Sea production will drop very significantly – and perhaps fizzle out altogether.That will make a nonsense of the OBR’s jacked-up oil and gas revenue projections and could even cost the Exchequer money.If this is truly a “windfall tax”, Chancellor, why does it still apply now – when the price of the Brent crude pumped from British waters is 20pc lower than before Putin invaded Ukraine?And why has this preposterous tax rate on so-called excess profits been extended until 2028 – when no one knows where the oil price will go?]"

Many wondered if he would move away from fossil fuels in support of his election campaign pledge to bring an end to deforestation. But Brazil still relies heavily on its oil revenues, as one of the biggest oil and gas powers in Latin America. And, Brazil has the potential to further develop its fossil fuels if Lula approves new exploration and production projects.Under the previous president, Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil introduced a wide range of investor-friendly policies for its oil and gas industry. And Lula’s inauguration made many worry that he might go back on many of these policies, which drove down the market value of state-owned Petrobras by almost 37 percent. Although Lula assured the public that he would not be making major changes to the sector, many remain sceptical. During his first term in office, between 1990 and 1994, Lula used Petrobras as a tool to achieve government policy goals, which left the company almost bankrupt. This happened once again under the leadership of Lula’s protégé Dilma Rousseff, leading Petrobras to become the most indebted oil company in the world. So, it’s no wonder that the energy sector is sceptical about Lula’s promises on oil and gas.Despite the uncertainty, there is still significant potential for Brazil’s oil and gas industry if Lula approves new exploration and production projects. Brazil, Latin America’s largest producer of crude, is expected to add 300,000 bpd to its output in 2023, to hit a record 3.4 million bpd. Five new platforms will come into operation in some of Brazil’s most prolific offshore fields. Output from the oil-rich South American state is expected to keep rising for several years to reach 4.6 million bpd by the end of the decade.Story continuesRelated: Analysts See Oil Prices Rising To $90 By End-2023However, as Brazil has seen no significant discoveries over the last decade, its crude production levels are expected to begin falling from 2030. Without new exploration activities, Brazil’s oil power is expected to diminish after this decade. But geologists believe there could be considerably more oil offshore in the northernmost part of Brazil. Exxon is currently developing new oil fields in Guyana’s water territories and there could be significant potential for development in Brazil’s waters.Jean Paul Prates, the Lula-appointed boss of Petrobras, stated in March “We came out very late to this game as a big producer, but we have to keep the ball rolling.” Prates made clear Petrobras’s intention to support exploration and production activities to ensure the longevity of Brazil’s oil and gas industry. Although many companies have looked elsewhere for their exploration operations in recent years, with significant development seen in the Caribbean countries of Guyana and Suriname.While Brazil remains a major oil power at present, the development of oil fields in Guyana and Suriname has allowed oil and gas companies to develop a new oil region, with the potential for decades of more oil production. In addition, oil majors operating in the region can pump more low-cost and low-carbon oil than in traditional areas. To remain competitive, Brazil will likely have to appeal to investors looking to develop their low-carbon oil sectors, which would also be attractive to Lula who sees the oil industry as key to economic growth but is also an environmental champion.This month, Exxon decided to quit its major Brazil project after failing to find hydrocarbons in several wells over five years. It began developing the offshore $4 billion acreage in 2017 but has slowly begun to send its workers to Guyana, Angola, and Canada to develop its more reliable oil regions. Exxon stated in a letter that its initial exploration drilling programme in Brazil is now complete and that it is “still engaged in Brazil and continues to pursue exploration activity in the country”.But there have been greater successes seen in the Equinor-operated $8 billion Bacalhau field project. Equinor and partner Exxon expect to pump 220,000 bpd of oil from Bacalhau once in operation. Although the start date has been repeatedly delayed production is now expected to begin in 2025.And a new programme from the Brazilian Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) could support the development of new oil projects. The Potencializa E&amp;P programme is aimed at attracting greater investment in the oil and gas industry to make Brazil the fourth-biggest oil producer in the world. As well as attracting foreign investors, the programme will encourage regional, independent oil and gas producers to develop projects. The MME says it has established the initiative in line with Lula’s aim to develop Brazil with “common sense and respect for the environment.”While there is still uncertainty around the future of Brazil’s oil and gas, and it has faced several challenges in recent years, there is significant potential for ongoing development. Brazil will have to compete with the low-cost, low-carbon oil of neighbouring Caribbean countries but if it can attract greater investment in exploration and development it could thrive for decades to come.By Felicity Bradstock for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Permian Will Lead U.S. Oil Deal-MakingOPEC Bites Back At IEA Over Production Cut WarningThe Brent Oil Benchmark Is About To Change ForeverRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

Can a bank crisis change that?,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/congress-hasnt-banned-lawmakers-from-trading-stocks-can-a-bank-crisis-change-that-122928914.html,1682771368,STORY,"['SIVBQ', 'SIVPQ', 'SCHW', 'MS']","[At least 9 lawmakers from both parties sold banking stocks during the financial turmoil in March, disclosures that are already renewing calls for an outright ban of Congressional stock trading.Notable traders include Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ), who sold Silicon Valley Bank stock after that bank had signaled deep trouble and one day before regulators seized the lender. There is also Rep. Jared Moskowitz (D-FL). An account linked to the freshman Congressman sold shares of Seacoast Banking Corporation (SBCF) just days before that stock tanked.Gottheimer and Moskowitz deny any impropriety and the transactions appear to be perfectly allowed within current law. Nevertheless, advocates of a ban say these trades further undermine the public's faith in Congress. The transactions have already spurred a demand for hearings on the issue.""I'm not at all surprised,"" said Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-VA) of the disclosures. She is the author of a letter this week calling for a public discussion of the trades.It’s become a familiar routine, Spanberger added in an interview this week, for a major news event to soon be followed by revelations of ""buying or selling by members of Congress in a way that looks as though it's connected.""Lawmakers in Washington are once again trying to stop their colleagues from trading stocks. (REUTERS/Jon Cherry)The Virginia lawmaker is the co-author with Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX) of a bill that would require members of Congress as well as their family members to put their investments into a qualified blind trust. They have introduced their legislation in each of the last three sessions of Congress without success so far.One of the notable sponsors of her bill is Gottheimer, the lawmaker who disclosed his sale of Silicon Valley Bank stock. He has also disclosed a sale of Charles Schwab (SCHW) stock and a purchase of shares in Morgan Stanley (MS) during the turmoil.A representative for Gottheimer, when asked about the Silicon Valley Bank trade, pointed to a 2022 statement where the lawmaker said he was in the process of setting up a blind trust and had already turned over investment decisions to a third party.Story continues""I don’t believe Members of Congress, judges, or any government employee in a policy role, should be involved in the day-to-day trading of securities, including crypto currencies,"" he said then.A representative for Moskowitz didn't respond to a request for comment but the lawmaker told The New York Times that the Seacoast trade took place in an account set up for his children and had been suggested by a financial adviser. He also maintains that the sale happened before a congressional briefing on the turmoil that he has previously discussed attending.'Broad, growing momentum'There are at least 4 bills that have been introduced this Congress that would levy such a ban on lawmaker trading, including one unveiled last week called the Ending Trading and Holdings in Congressional Stocks (ETHICS) Act.That effort is being led by Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR) who said in a statement to Yahoo Finance that the reaction to last week's unveiling has shown ""broad, growing momentum"" adding that ""without action, we will only continue to hear of situations where lawmakers voted on bills while holding or trading stocks that could be affected.""Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR) speaks at a press conference on the introduction of the Senate ETHICS Act which would restrict members of Congress and their immediate family members from owning or trading stocks while serving in office. (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)The current rules governing the trading of stocks by lawmakers were put in place when then-President Obama signed the STOCK Act of 2012. That legislation clarified that insider trading laws applied to lawmakers and also instituted the 45-day disclosure rule.Calls for an outright ban have intensified in the years since after a series of scandals. The most infamous incident came in 2020 when then Sens. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) and Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) sold an array of stocks after a private briefing on COVID-19 but before the larger public was fully aware of the coming pandemic.Burr faced a Justice Department investigation that eventually ended without charges and retired earlier this year while Loeffler lost her 2020 bid for election.Some have even launched ETFs that currently allow traders to invest like their lawmakers in a bid to bring attention to the issue.Congress seemed to be on the verge of taking action late last year before talks fell apart largely over the issue of whether to include Supreme Court justices in a ban.""We're not there just yet,"" says Donald Sherman, a deputy director at the watchdog group the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, of the political will for ban but says the selling that took place during the banking turmoil offers another opportunity for advocates to press their case.""Whether it’s the banking crisis scandal or the next one that will inevitably happen, eventually the problem will be too big, and the support for reform too strong, for leadership to continue to ignore.""'Do we want to take some action?'The various new bills seeking an outright ban are from lawmakers who hail from both parties.One from Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) is called the Preventing Elected Leaders from Owning Securities and Investments (PELOSI) Act to highlight the frequent trading activities of Paul Pelosi, the husband of Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi (D-CA).Another effort comes from Rep. Angie Craig (D-MN) who has a bill called the Halt Unchecked Member Benefits with Lobbying Elimination (HUMBLE) Act.Merkley's bill has the support of 21 Democratic senators and bipartisan support in the House with Reps. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL) and Michael Cloud (R-TX) pushing the effort there.U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-VA) talks to fellow representatives prior to a State of the Union address in 2023. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)As for Spanberger's efforts, her bill with Rep. Roy currently has 56 co-sponsors from both parties and no word yet on whether any hearing will be in the offing but she maintains that things are moving ever so slowly in her direction.""Congress as an entity can make the choice: Do we want to keep having these embarrassing headlines that denigrate the public trust or do we want to take some action?"" she asked.Ben Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.Click here for politics news related to business and moneyRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

Despite this raise, the dividend yield of 1.7% is only a modest boost to shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for Marathon Oil Marathon Oil's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageThe dividend yield is a little bit low, but sustainability of the payments is also an important part of evaluating an income stock. However, Marathon Oil's earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to fall by 25.0% over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio could be 8.8%, which we consider to be quite comfortable, with most of the company's earnings left over to grow the business in the future.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityWhile the company has been paying a dividend for a long time, it has cut the dividend at least once in the last 10 years. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.68 total annually to $0.40. Doing the maths, this is a decline of about 5.2% per year. A company that decreases its dividend over time generally isn't what we are looking for.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowDividends have been going in the wrong direction, so we definitely want to see a different trend in the earnings per share. Marathon Oil has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 44% per annum. Rapid earnings growth and a low payout ratio suggest this company has been effectively reinvesting in its business. Should that continue, this company could have a bright future.We Really Like Marathon Oil's DividendOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Marathon Oil is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. The earnings easily cover the company's distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. If earnings do fall over the next 12 months, the dividend could be buffeted a little bit, but we don't think it should cause too much of a problem in the long term. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. For example, we've identified 4 warning signs for Marathon Oil (1 is a bit concerning!) that you should be aware of before investing. Is Marathon Oil not quite the opportunity you were looking for?

Panel Chair Martin Coleman emphasized that cloud gaming requires a free, competitive market to drive innovation and choice.The proposed merger has faced roadblocks in the U.K. since its announcement in January 2022, with an in-depth review launched in September of the same year.According to BMO Capital, this is a shocking development as the CMA had previously concluded that the deal would not hurt competition in the console market, which seemed the more significant concern. The CMA was always clear that it was skeptical about the cloud gaming market. Activision Blizzard has announced that it intends to collaborate with Microsoft to appeal the decision.As always, InvestingPro users got the eye-popping news on the deal, and analyst reactions, in real-time.

The bidding process is being run by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company, sources told Reuters, and a deal should be announced by Sunday night.This week saw steep declines in the shares that began when the bank disclosed $100B in customer withdrawals the previous month.In an effort to stabilize the bank's finances, First Republic's advisors had attempted to persuade larger U.S. banks to acquire bonds from them at above-market prices, as reported by CNBC.Shares closed the week with a massive 75% loss.InvestingPro subscribers got a jump on this news in real-time.Carrier Global to acquire Viessmann Climate Solutions, analysts reactCarrier Global (NYSE:CARR) has confirmed its acquisition of Viessmann Climate Solutions for €12B in cash (80%) and stock (20%), with the stock issued directly to Viessmann Group under a long-term ownership commitment.The acquisition reinforces Carrier's position as a leading player in the European climate and energy transition market, positioning the company for sustainable growth.Following the announcement, several Wall Street firms lowered their price targets on the stock, including Barclays with a new target of $48.00 (from $50.00), Citi with a new target of $45.00 (from $48.00), RBC Capital with a new target of $48.00 (from $54.00), and Morgan Stanley with a new target of $49.00 (from $50.00).Shares fell more than 7% this week.Getty Images questions the $4B acquisition offer from Trillium CapitalGetty Images (NYSE:GETY) shares jumped 31% on Monday after activist investor Trillium Capital announced that it has made a bid to acquire the company for $10 per share in cash.However, the next day shares fell more than 4% as Getty Images said the offer is not sufficiently credible to warrant engagement by its Board.Shares closed the week with a 27% gain.Amid these volatile markets and endless market-moving updates, seize on the right timing to maximize your profits: Always be the first to know with InvestingPro.

Moreover, if their stock prices are significantly undervalued, they become even more compelling investments. The combination of reliable, lucrative current income with long-term wealth compounding is a passive income investor’s dream.High-yield and attractive long-term total returns are definitely not mutually exclusive. Thanks in part to rising interest rates, we are at a rare moment in modern market history where income investors can buy high-yielding stocks that also have very defensive business models and reliable dividend growth potential. When you combine the high yields with dividend growth and the potential for valuation multiples to increase over time back toward more historical norms, these stocks could deliver outstanding risk-adjusted total returns for shareholders.This article discusses three undervalued dividend stocks that offer strong yields and are undervalued. Therefore, they present opportunities for high total returns over time.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)Walgreens (WBA) store exterior and sign in Pompano Beach, FloridaSource: saaton / Shutterstock.comWalgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) is the largest retail pharmacy in the US and Europe. It operates in over nine countries with 13,000+ stores. It also employs over 315,000 people across the U.S., Europe and Latin America.Walgreens’ competitive advantage stems from its large-scale and extensive network in a significant, growing industry. The company maintains a reasonable payout ratio, providing income stability for investors. Despite a decline in earnings in 2020, Walgreens has historically demonstrated resilience. For example, it suffered only a 6.9% drop in earnings in 2009 .Walgreens has experienced an average annual earnings per share (EPS) growth rate of 7.6% over the past decade, driven by top-line growth, steady net profit margins, and a reduced number of outstanding shares. However, in 2020, EPS declined by 21% due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Story continuesDespite short-term challenges, long-term growth prospects are promising. This is due to factors like an aging population, focus on becoming a health destination, and the company’s role in Covid-19 vaccinations and testing. While the tailwind from Covid-19 vaccinations is subsiding, Walgreens will likely continue to grow in the future.Between its 4% anticipated EPS compound annual growth rate (CAGR), 5.4% expected annualized tailwind from multiple expansion over the next half decade, and 5.5% current dividend yield, WBA is positioned to deliver double-digit annualized total returns over the next half decade. As a result, it appears to be a compelling buy while also offering investors attractive, sustainable and growing current income.Kinder Morgan (KMI)Kinder Morgan logo on a sign outside the company headquarters in Houston.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comKinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) is one of the largest energy companies in the U.S. It focuses on midstream storage and transportation of oil, gas and other energy commodities. The company operates around 83,000 miles of pipelines and 144 terminals. These pipelines transport natural gas, refined petroleum products, crude oil and carbon dioxide. Kinder Morgan generates about 90% of its cash flow from fee-based services, and the vast majority of its counterparties are investment grade. As a result, it operates in many ways like a toll road and generally avoids commodity price risk.Kinder Morgan operates in the cyclical energy sector but maintains fairly stable cash flows due to its business model. Although the company previously had a low interest coverage ratio and high debt, leading to a dividend cut in 2016, the new dividend payout level is secure. The company used avings from the dividend reduction to pay down debt and improve the balance sheet, resulting in credit rating upgrades from Standard &amp; Poor’s and Moody’s. As one of the largest energy companies in the U.S., Kinder Morgan benefits from significant network and economies of scale advantages. It is the largest natural gas transporter, moving about 40% of the gas used in the U.S., as well as the largest independent transporter of petroleum products, carbon dioxide and terminals operator.Kinder Morgan’s future growth catalysts include new pipeline and terminal projects, driven by the increasing demand for natural gas as it replaces coal. However, political headwinds may slow down growth for the company. In 2023, Kinder Morgan plans to invest in growth projects and joint ventures, funding them through internally generated cash flow without accessing capital markets. The company’s distributable cash flow per share is expected to be around $2.13 in 2023. It will likely increase steadily over the next half decade due to growth projects and share repurchases.While KMI’s anticipated 2.6% distributable cash flow per share CAGR over the next half decade is relatively unimpressive, the 6.2% dividend yield and expectations of a flat valuation multiple push the total return profile to the high-single-digits. As a result, KMI looks like a worthwhile investment for dependable and lucrative income and solid total returns.Verizon (VZ)Verizon (VZ) logo above the entrance to a Verizon store.Source: photobyphm / Shutterstock.comVerizon (NYSE:VZ) is a leading wireless carrier in the U.S. It generates 75% of its revenue from wireless services and 25% from broadband and cable services. Verizon’s network reaches approximately 300 million people, covering 98% of the U.S. population.Verizon offers a high and stable dividend yield, benefiting from increased cash flow due to a lower tax rate and reduced net debt levels. The company is known as the best wireless carrier in the U.S. It boasts strong customer retention and potential for upselling higher-priced plans. Additionally, Verizon is rolling out 5G service, giving it a competitive edge and making its stock resilient during market downturns.Verizon’s EPS has grown at 2.6% annually over the past decade. With a slightly reduced forward expected growth rate of 2.5%, the company’s 2023 guidance suggests a potential EPS of $5.32 per share by 2028.Like Kinder Morgan, Verizon likely won’t be a big growth stock in the coming years. It has an estimated CAGR of just 2.5% over the next half decade. That said, its 6.7% current dividend yield — which appears to be quite safe and very sustainable for the foreseeable future — along with the 5.7% expected annualized tailwind from valuation multiple expansion mean that the company is well-positioned to deliver double-digit annualized total returns over the next five years. As a result, it looks like it could be a great investment for generating substantial returns alongside a lucrative income stream.On the date of publication, Bob Ciura did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

23,12dc18c8-dae5-3848-a964-7a92b2f42a29,TDG,2023-04-30,One TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG) insider reduced their stake by 4.6% in the previous year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-transdigm-group-incorporated-nyse-140020754.html,1682776820,STORY,['TDG'],"[Insiders were net sellers of TransDigm Group Incorporated's (NYSE:TDG ) stock during the past year. That is, insiders sold more stock than they bought.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for TransDigm Group The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At TransDigm GroupOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Independent Director, Robert Small, for US$3.3m worth of shares, at about US$742 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$765). When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. It is worth noting that this sale was only 4.6% of Robert Small's holding. Robert Small was the only individual insider to sell shares in the last twelve months.The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.TransDigm Group Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last three months saw significant insider selling at TransDigm Group. In total, Independent Director Robert Small sold US$3.3m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Does TransDigm Group Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that TransDigm Group insiders own 0.5% of the company, worth about US$189m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About TransDigm Group Insiders?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And our longer term analysis of insider transactions didn't bring confidence, either. But it is good to see that TransDigm Group is growing earnings. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing TransDigm Group. At Simply Wall St, we've found that TransDigm Group has 3 warning signs (2 are significant!) that deserve your attention before going any further with your analysis.Of course TransDigm Group may not be the best stock to buy.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the biotech industry and go directly to the 5 Largest Biotech Companies in the US. The largest biotech companies in the US have a total market cap of $88 trillion. Latest Developments in the Biotech IndustryThe biotechnology industry is making significant developments in food and agriculture to help minimize health risks and combat environmental threats. For example, a French biotech company called Enterome has collaborated with Nestlé to produce an immunity drug for the treatment of food allergies. Similarly, companies like UPSIDE Foods and BioBetter Limited are producing cultivated meat, which is sustainable and climate-friendly, and has gotten approved for safety by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).Experts in biotechnology are also producing various profitable products that are encouraging growth in the pharmaceutical sector. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have developed a vaccine printer that can make hundreds of vaccine patches during a day. This biotechnological invention can help combat the spread of the Ebola virus in countries that are still vulnerable to the epidemic such as Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. CureVac N.V. (NASDAQ:CVAC) had begun developing RNA printing technology in March 2022 to help the invention of this vaccine printer.   To further enhance the integration of artificial intelligence with biotechnology, researchers at Insilico Medicine are using ChatGPT to pace up the process of discovering potential drug targets for treatment. Similarly, scientists are using software such as Scilife, Veeva Vault, and Ace, which support innovation in biotechnology by improving content and quality management in laboratories. Currently, the most common diseases in the US are cancer, obesity, and heart-related diseases. Various biotechnology companies are making huge investments to combat these diseases such as Guardant Health, Inc. (NASDAQ:GH), which developed liquid biopsy for cancer detection; and Verve Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:VERV), which is developing gene editing medicines for cardiovascular diseases.Story continuesIn order to combat diabetes, Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) produced medicines called Ozempic and Wegovy, which quickly garnered mass popularity and celebrity endorsements. These are also prescribed by American doctors for weight loss and fighting cardiovascular issues. Digital health management companies such as WeightWatchers and Lark Health are also using biotechnology to help patients cope with chronic diseases by offering weight loss programs and health monitoring devices. Outlook of the Biotech IndustryThe United States is the global leader in biotechnology, with Massachusetts being the biggest biotech hub in the world. It is closely followed by China, with the UK and the rest of Europe trailing behind. In response to China’s heavy investment in the biotechnology sector, the Biden government announced its creation of the National Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing Initiative, to support its bio-economy already worth $1 trillion in 2022. Between 2022 and 2023, the S&amp;P Biotechnology index increased by 8.86%. However, since the Federal Reserve is expected to increase interest rates through 2023, the value of biotech stocks might decrease compared to previous years, where the industry was supplied with huge investments and cheap capital to encourage the development of Covid 19 treatment. Between 2022 and 2030, the global market is forecasted to grow at a compound annual rate of 13.9%, ultimately reaching $3879 billion in 2030. The development of genomic techniques to combat chronic diseases, enhancing the portability of biotechnological instruments, and the integration of robotics and biotechnology are predicted to be some of the key drivers of this industrial growth during the coming years. 27 Largest Biotech Companies in the USTonhom1009/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyFor our list of the largest biotech companies in the US, we've ranked them in ascending order based on their annual revenue for the latest year.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) insiders disposed of US$5.2m worth of stock,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/possible-bearish-signals-amgen-inc-120016035.html,1682769616,STORY,['AMGN'],"[Many Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Amgen The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At AmgenThe Executive VP, Jonathan Graham, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.3m worth of shares at a price of US$242 each. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$240. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).In the last year Amgen insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeI will like Amgen better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insider OwnershipFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Amgen insiders own about US$200m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Amgen Insider Transactions Indicate?The fact that there have been no Amgen insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Amgen insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

28,6b97625c-6a6b-3de4-b033-1b1d8b0ff319,NEM,2023-04-30,3 Stocks That Will Surge if Rate Hikes Are Paused,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-surge-rate-hikes-105028471.html,1682506228,STORY,"['GC=F', 'RIO', 'COIN', 'NEM']","[Rate hike sensitive stocks have had a tough time recently, but once those hikes end, stand back and watch these names fly.An event that the markets eagerly look forward to is the Federal Open Market Committee meeting. The stance of monetary policies has a significant impact on the broader markets and several sectors.Anticipating the potential direction of monetary policies can therefore help investors make money on rake hike sensitive stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe federal reserve has pursued contractionary monetary policy in the last few quarters to curb inflation. However, it finally seems that the policy stance will change.The leading economic index for the U.S. has declined to its lowest level since November 2020.The possibility of expansionary monetary policies will increase as the recession probability increases. I expect the Fed to pursue expansionary policies in the second half of 2023.Expansionary policies make liquidity in the financial system swell. This translates into higher speculative activity across risky asset classes. Further, contractionary policies results in a stronger dollar and expansionary policies imply a weaker dollar.Therefore, there exists an interesting relation between interest rate and stock market. Let’s discuss three rate hike sensitive stocks that are positioned to surge higher on reversal of policy stance.NEMNewmont Corporation$47.76RIORio Tinto$76.16COINCoinbase$55.58Newmont Corporation (NEM)Newmont logo on a mobile phone screenSource: Piotr Swat/ShutterstockGold has been trading around $2,000 an ounce. In the event of rate hike pause or rate cuts, I expect the precious metal to surge to new highs.The best way to get exposure to gold without buying bricks is through quality gold mining stocks. Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) looks attractive at a forward price-earnings ratio of 21.1. The stock also offers an attractive dividend yield of 3.36%.From the perspective of free cash flow growth, Newmont expects FCF of $2.4 billion if gold is at $2,000 an ounce. For every $100 increase in gold price, the company expects annual FCF to increase by $400 million.Story continuesThe company is therefore positioned for healthy FCF upside. This will translate into dividend growth and higher share repurchase.Newmont has an investment grade balance sheet and a strong liquidity buffer of $6.7 billion. I expect the company to pursue aggressive organic and acquisition driven growth.Currently, the company has guided for 6 million ounces of annual gold production through 2032. This provides clear cash flow visibility for shareholder value creation.Rio Tinto (RIO)the rio tinto (RIO) logo on a building during daylightSource: Rob Bayer / Shutterstock.comRio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) stock has trended lower by 10% for year-to-date 2023. This does not come as a surprise, with a recession likely to affect the demand for industrial commodities.However, there are two points to note. First, RIO stock trades at a forward P/E of 8 and the stock seems significantly undervalued.In an event of rate hike pause or rate cut, I expect industrial commodities to surge. A deeper recession would also imply fiscal expansionary policy in the form of stimulus.This will add to the positive sentiment. Considering the valuation, I expect a strong rally in the second half of 2023.Rio Tinto is also attractive from a fundamental perspective. Last year, the company reported $9 billion in free cash flow. The company plans to invest $27 billion between 2023 and 2025.These investments will translate into revenue growth and cash flow upside. I must add that RIO stock provides an attractive dividend yield of 7.6% and dividends are sustainable.Coinbase (COIN)Coinbase (COIN), is an American company that operates a cryptocurrency exchange platform. Ethereum (ETH-USD) coin on the background of the Coinbase inscription.Source: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.comCryptocurrencies is another asset class that is likely to gain if they paused the rate hike. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has been trending higher and it’s likely that the uptrend will sustain.I am therefore bullish on Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) stock for a major rally in the coming quarters.A weak dollar and excess liquidity in the financial system will be positive for cryptocurrencies. As trading and speculative activity increases, the world’s second largest crypto exchange is positioned to benefit.Of course, Coinbase had a setback in 2022, with the company reporting EBITDA level losses. However, with Bitcoin in an uptrend, I expect improved Q1 results.It’s also encouraging to note that despite the headwinds in 2022, Coinbase reported growth in the subscription and services revenue segment. As institutional clients swell and assets under custody increases, I expect this segment performance to remain strong.Coinbase ended 2022 with cash and equivalents of $5.5 billion. This provides ample buffer for global expansion and continued platform development.On the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

30,765a14b4-ea6c-3e15-a351-12868f85e802,GD,2023-04-30,General Dynamics' (NYSE:GD) Returns On Capital Not Reflecting Well On The Business,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-dynamics-nyse-gd-returns-140014790.html,1682776814,STORY,['GD'],"[What are the early trends we should look for to identify a stock that could multiply in value over the long term? In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. In light of that, when we looked at General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on General Dynamics is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.12 = US$4.4b ÷ (US$52b - US$15b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).So, General Dynamics has an ROCE of 12%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry average of 9.2% it's much better. See our latest analysis for General Dynamics roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for General Dynamics compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for General Dynamics.How Are Returns Trending?On the surface, the trend of ROCE at General Dynamics doesn't inspire confidence. Over the last five years, returns on capital have decreased to 12% from 19% five years ago. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.Story continuesOn a side note, General Dynamics has done well to pay down its current liabilities to 30% of total assets. So we could link some of this to the decrease in ROCE. What's more, this can reduce some aspects of risk to the business because now the company's suppliers or short-term creditors are funding less of its operations. Since the business is basically funding more of its operations with it's own money, you could argue this has made the business less efficient at generating ROCE.The Key TakeawayIn summary, General Dynamics is reinvesting funds back into the business for growth but unfortunately it looks like sales haven't increased much just yet. Unsurprisingly, the stock has only gained 26% over the last five years, which potentially indicates that investors are accounting for this going forward. Therefore, if you're looking for a multi-bagger, we'd propose looking at other options.Like most companies, General Dynamics does come with some risks, and we've found 1 warning sign  that you should be aware of.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

The argument for picking up a defense company right now is relatively strong.First there’s the obvious ramp up in global tensions, which has supported demand from governments around the world looking to beef up their military capabilities. But the defense sector also offers some insulation during economic slowdowns.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWhile belt-tightening is a natural consequence of slow economic growth, rarely do we see defense budgets slashed. So what makes for valuable defense stocks? One hallmark of the industry is reliable income well into the future. Defense companies make large and lucrative contracts that stretch years and sometimes decades into the future.The management of these future revenue streams is paramount to their success. With that in mind, it makes sense to look for companies with robust and growing order books who spend that income on growth areas like cyber security, AI and nuclear. The industry itself is hard to break into, with only a handful of large players making up the bulk of government contracts. That means investors can expect to pick up some “steady eddy” stocks.But there are also corners of the market that are growing rapidly— particularly when we look at areas like cyber security and AI. Investors are likely to find more growth potential here, but also a hefty dose of risk as well. BAESYBae$52.01LMTLockheed Martin$476.10CAECAE$22.61BAE (BAESY)BAE Systems' (BAESY) M777 155mm Ultra light towed howitzer at Eurosatory 2008 military exhibitionSource: Flying Camera / Shutterstock.comBAE (OTCMKTS:BAESY) makes military equipment like aircraft carriers and fighter jets, making it a defense stock worth considering as demand for these items rises amid global tensions.So far, the group’s seen the benefit of growing defense budgets and that’s helped it to expand its portfolio into potential high-growth areas.Story continuesThe beauty of making large and complicated jet planes is there are only a handful of companies to compete with. Barriers to entry are high so once you’re set up it’s a matter of quality control and relationship management. But BAE isn’t resting on its laurels.The group’s order book has swelled to $73.2 billion, leaving the group with plenty of financial firepower to accelerate growth.BAE’s funnelling some of that into research and development as well as strategic acquisitions. This includes purchases to beef up its Cyber &amp; Intelligence portfolio.For now, this represents only a small part of the business, but it could become a much more important growth engine in the future.Lockheed Martin (LMT)A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comIt’s impossible to talk about defense stocks without bringing Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) into the mix. This is the world’s largest defense company thanks to its relationship with the world’s largest defense spender — America.Lockheed’s been able to take pole position in the industry thanks to industry-leading research that allows it to create fighter planes, missiles and other electronic devices. The group’s one of the top providers of the world’s most expensive airplane, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. With all that in mind, it might sound like growth will be scarce. The group’s been struggling to grow its order book as quickly as investors have become accustomed to and supply chain constraints have weighed.These problems look likely to resolve in the months ahead, particularly with order book growth, given that defense spending is a top priority these days.That’s meant the group’s share price has grown little so far this year, making for a worthwhile entry point. Lockheed’s top-dog position means it’s got a layer of security, and as some issues holding back growth clear, the stock could be ready to run.CAE (CAE)the cockpit of a plane with two pilots sitting in itSource: ShutterstockCAE (NYSE:CAE) is a more specific play among defense stocks. It’s a Canadian company best-known for its pilot training programmes, and it’s not necessarily a pure-play defense stock.The group makes training solutions for both commercial and military pilots. This is largely using simulator technology, which it has extended into the healthcare space as well.Notably, the defence sector makes up 44% of overall revenue. Civil aviation is currently the largest part of the business and has been the driving force behind growth of late.This makes sense given that Covid took a lot of pilots out of circulation, leading to demand for training and up-skilling as flights got back to normal.The mix of businesses is an important layer of diversification, and healthcare represents an important growth avenue as the group continues to improve profitability there. CAE makes for an interesting pick in the space with plenty of growth runway ahead. On the date of publication, Marie Brodbeck held shares in BAE.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Rockwell Automation with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Rockwell Automation How Fast Is Rockwell Automation Growing?The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Shareholders will be happy to know that Rockwell Automation's EPS has grown 23% each year, compound, over three years. If the company can sustain that sort of growth, we'd expect shareholders to come away satisfied.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. The music to the ears of Rockwell Automation shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 15% to 18% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. For finer detail, click on the image.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-historyWhile we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for Rockwell Automation?Are Rockwell Automation Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Rockwell Automation, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Given insiders own a significant chunk of shares, currently valued at US$73m, they have plenty of motivation to push the business to succeed. That's certainly enough to let shareholders know that management will be very focussed on long term growth.It's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Rockwell Automation, with market caps over US$8.0b, is about US$13m.Rockwell Automation's CEO took home a total compensation package worth US$11m in the year leading up to September 2022. That is actually below the median for CEO's of similarly sized companies. While the level of CEO compensation shouldn't be the biggest factor in how the company is viewed, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.Is Rockwell Automation Worth Keeping An Eye On?For growth investors, Rockwell Automation's raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night. If you still have your doubts, remember too that company insiders have a considerable investment aligning themselves with the shareholders and CEO pay is quite modest compared to similarly sized companiess. Everyone has their own preferences when it comes to investing but it definitely makes Rockwell Automation look rather interesting indeed. Even so, be aware that  Rockwell Automation is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis , you should know about...Although Rockwell Automation certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares. If you like to see insider buying, then this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying, could be exactly what you're looking for.Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.Have feedback on this article?

38,65c05f95-4e7e-3ab3-8d20-0507d1f301ad,WMB,2023-04-30,Williams Companies (NYSE:WMB) Is Increasing Its Dividend To $0.4475,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/williams-companies-nyse-wmb-increasing-120852412.html,1682770132,STORY,['WMB'],"[The Williams Companies, Inc.'s (NYSE:WMB) dividend will be increasing from last year's payment of the same period to $0.4475 on 26th of June. This will take the annual payment to 5.9% of the stock price, which is above what most companies in the industry pay. See our latest analysis for Williams Companies Williams Companies' Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsImpressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. Prior to this announcement, the company was paying out 101% of what it was earning and 84% of cash flows. While the cash payout ratio isn't necessarily a cause for concern, the company is probably focusing more on returning cash to shareholders than growing the business.Earnings per share is forecast to rise by 19.5% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, our estimates say the payout ratio could reach 88% - on the higher side, but we wouldn't necessarily say this is unsustainable.historic-dividendWilliams Companies Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.20 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $1.79. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 4.1% per annum over that time. Although we can't deny that the dividend has been remarkably stable in the past, the growth has been pretty muted.Dividend Growth Is DoubtfulThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. However, things aren't all that rosy. It's not great to see that Williams Companies' earnings per share has fallen at approximately 8.6% per year over the past five years. Declining earnings will inevitably lead to the company paying a lower dividend in line with lower profits. It's not all bad news though, as the earnings are predicted to rise over the next 12 months - we would just be a bit cautious until this can turn into a longer term trend.Story continuesThe Dividend Could Prove To Be UnreliableOverall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think Williams Companies will make a great income stock. In the past the payments have been stable, but we think the company is paying out too much for this to continue for the long term. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income.It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. Case in point: We've spotted 3 warning signs for Williams Companies (of which 1 is a bit concerning!) you should know about. If you are a dividend investor, you might also want to look at our curated list of high yield dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?

39,f34b36bc-1098-3a50-957c-6e2d05e1864f,BA,2023-04-30,Boeing (NYSE:BA) May Have Issues Allocating Its Capital,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boeing-nyse-ba-may-issues-110033558.html,1682852433,STORY,['BA'],"[If you're looking at a mature business that's past the growth phase, what are some of the underlying trends that pop up? Typically, we'll see the trend of both return on capital employed (ROCE) declining and this usually coincides with a decreasing amount of capital employed. This combination can tell you that not only is the company investing less, it's earning less on what it does invest. In light of that, from a first glance at Boeing (NYSE:BA), we've spotted some signs that it could be struggling, so let's investigate.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Boeing:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.014 = US$608m ÷ (US$136b - US$94b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Thus, Boeing has an ROCE of 1.4%.  Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry average of 9.2%. Check out our latest analysis for Boeing roceIn the above chart we have measured Boeing's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Boeing here  for free.So How Is Boeing's ROCE Trending?There is reason to be cautious about Boeing, given the returns are trending downwards. About five years ago, returns on capital were 28%, however they're now substantially lower than that as we saw above. On top of that, it's worth noting that the amount of capital employed within the business has remained relatively steady. Companies that exhibit these attributes tend to not be shrinking, but they can be mature and facing pressure on their margins from competition. If these trends continue, we wouldn't expect Boeing to turn into a multi-bagger.Story continuesOn a side note, Boeing's current liabilities are still rather high at 69% of total assets. This can bring about some risks because the company is basically operating with a rather large reliance on its suppliers or other sorts of short-term creditors. Ideally we'd like to see this reduce as that would mean fewer obligations bearing risks.Our Take On Boeing's ROCEIn summary, it's unfortunate that Boeing is generating lower returns from the same amount of capital. Long term shareholders who've owned the stock over the last five years have experienced a 35% depreciation in their investment, so it appears the market might not like these trends either. That being the case, unless the underlying trends revert to a more positive trajectory, we'd consider looking elsewhere.Boeing does have some risks though, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Boeing  that you might be interested in.While Boeing may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

At the same time, it’s probably best to wait for a better opportunity to jump in because anyone going headlong into AI now will pay a steep price.That’s excellent advice because the companies we think have the best AI applications and solutions today might not even exist three to five years from now. As a result, AI investing success requires considerable due diligence and patience from investors.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading Tips Conservative investors may want to cast a broader net in the form of an exchange-traded fund (ETF) or mutual fund rather than investing in one or two leading AI companies. However, if it’s individual AI opportunities you seek, the three below, selected from the top holdings of the First Trust Nasdaq Artificial Intelligence and Robotics ETF (NASDAQ:ROBT), have interesting AI applications that are expected to grow in the next few years.  PROPROS Holdings$27.96NOWServiceNow$442.28ANSSANSYS$312.70PROS Holdings (PRO)A laptop is open to a marketplace and there is a small cart with boxes on the keyboard. online shopping.Source: Natee Photo / ShutterstockPROS Holdings (NYSE:PRO) provides an AI-based platform that gathers and analyzes data to enable companies to offer their end-user customers personalized pricing and product suggestions. CEO Andres Reiner provided an example of how customers use its platform in the Q4 2022 conference call: Signature Aviation, a B2B aviation services company, selected PROS in Q4 to take advantage of our latest Gen IV AI advancements to fuel their profitable growth strategy.

(NYSE:PFE) will increase its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 9th of June to $0.41. This makes the dividend yield 4.2%, which is above the industry average. See our latest analysis for Pfizer Pfizer's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. Before making this announcement, Pfizer was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to fall by 41.6%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we believe the payout ratio could be 52%, which we are pretty comfortable with and we think is feasible on an earnings basis.historic-dividendPfizer Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.88 total annually to $1.64. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 6.4% a year over that time. Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.The Dividend Has Growth PotentialThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Pfizer has impressed us by growing EPS at 9.3% per year over the past five years. A low payout ratio and decent growth suggests that the company is reinvesting well, and it also has plenty of room to increase the dividend over time.We Really Like Pfizer's DividendIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. The company is generating plenty of cash, and the earnings also quite easily cover the distributions. If earnings do fall over the next 12 months, the dividend could be buffeted a little bit, but we don't think it should cause too much of a problem in the long term. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

(TSE: 4503, President and CEO: Naoki Okamura, ""Astellas"") and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) announced today that XTANDI® (enzalutamide) plus leuprolide significantly reduced the risk of metastasis or death by 58% versus placebo plus leuprolide (Hazard Ratio [HR]: 0.42; 95% Confidence Interval [CI], 0.30–0.61; P&lt;0.0001), as assessed by the primary endpoint of metastasis-free survival (MFS), in men with non-metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (nmHSPC; also known as non-metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer or nmCSPC) with high-risk biochemical recurrence (BCR). These data from the Phase 3 EMBARK trial, which evaluated patients across three study arms (XTANDI plus leuprolide [n=355], placebo plus leuprolide [n=358], or XTANDI monotherapy [n=355]), were presented as a plenary session during the 2023 American Urological Association Annual Meeting (Saturday, April 29 at 9:45 a.m. CT).Pfizer | AstellasThe overall safety profile was consistent with the known safety profile of each of the medicines. The most common adverse events in those treated with XTANDI plus leuprolide were fatigue, hot flush, and arthralgia and in those treated with XTANDI monotherapy were fatigue, gynecomastia, and arthralgia.""There are patients with localized prostate cancer who undergo prostatectomy or radiation therapy in an attempt to cure their disease, but, unfortunately, some patients will develop BCR,"" said Neal Shore, M.D., F.A.C.S., U.S. Chief Medical Officer of Urology and Surgical Oncology, GenesisCare, Director, Carolina Urologic Research Center, and Primary Investigator for the EMBARK study. ""Importantly, some patients with BCR are at very high risk for developing metastatic disease, which can lead to a cascade of therapeutic interventions. The clinical goal of BCR therapy is to delay cancer progression and avoid metastatic disease. The MFS results from the EMBARK study demonstrate that this intervention with XTANDI plus leuprolide was statistically significant for patients with high-risk BCR.""Story continues""The EMBARK study is a Phase 3 trial exploring the potential of enzalutamide in patients with non-metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer with high-risk BCR,"" said Stephen J. Freedland, M.D., Director of the Center for Integrated Research in Cancer and Lifestyle and the Warschaw Robertson Law Families Chair in Prostate Cancer at Cedars-Sinai Cancer and Co-Principal Investigator of the Clinical Trial. ""If approved, we hope to bring a new option to men earlier in the course of their disease.""Consistent with the study's primary endpoint, statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements were also observed in the trial's key secondary endpoints in both the XTANDI combination and monotherapy arms. Specifically, the XTANDI monotherapy arm demonstrated that treatment with XTANDI reduced the risk of metastasis or death by 37% versus leuprolide plus placebo (HR: 0.63; 95% CI, 0.46–0.87; P=0.0049), meeting its MFS endpoint. Treatment with XTANDI plus leuprolide and XTANDI monotherapy reduced the risk of PSA progression by 93% (HR: 0.07; 95% CI, 0.03–0.14; P&lt;0.0001) and 67% (HR: 0.33; 95% CI, 0.23–0.49; P&lt;0.0001), respectively, versus placebo plus leuprolide. The progression risk in starting a new antineoplastic therapy was reduced by 64% in those treated with XTANDI plus leuprolide (HR: 0.36; 95% CI, 0.26–0.49; P&lt;0.0001) and 46% in those treated with XTANDI monotherapy (HR: 0.54; 95% CI, 0.41–0.71; P&lt;0.0001) versus placebo plus leuprolide.A positive trend in the key secondary endpoint of overall survival (OS) was also observed in the XTANDI combination arm at the time of the analysis, but these data were not yet mature. Patients in the trial will be followed for a subsequent final OS analysis.Detailed results from the trial will be submitted for peer-reviewed publication. Additionally, the EMBARK data will be discussed with regulatory authorities, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), to support a potential regulatory submission for XTANDI in this indication in 2023.About EMBARKThe Astellas- and Pfizer-led Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-national trial enrolled 1,068 patients with non-metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (nmHSPC; also known as non-metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer or nmCSPC) with high-risk biochemical recurrence (BCR) at sites in the United States, Canada, Europe, South America and the Asia-Pacific region. Patients who were considered to experience high-risk BCR had a prostate-specific antigen doubling time (PSA-DT) ≤ 9 months; serum testosterone ≥ 150 ng/dL (5.2 nmol/L); and screening PSA by the central laboratory ≥ 1 ng/mL if they had a radical prostatectomy (with or without radiotherapy) as primary treatment for prostate cancer, or at least 2 ng/mL above the nadir if they had radiotherapy only as primary treatment for prostate cancer. Patients in the EMBARK trial were randomized to receive enzalutamide 160 mg daily plus leuprolide (n=355), enzalutamide 160 mg as a monotherapy (n=355), or placebo plus leuprolide (n=358). Leuprolide 22.5 mg was administered every 12 weeks.The primary endpoint of the trial was metastasis-free survival (MFS) for enzalutamide plus leuprolide versus placebo plus leuprolide. MFS is defined as the duration of time in months between randomization and the earliest objective evidence of radiographic progression by central imaging or death. For more information on the EMBARK trial (NCT02319837) go to www.clinicaltrials.gov.XTANDI, either in combination with leuprolide or as a monotherapy, has not been approved by any regulatory agency for the treatment of patients with nmHSPC with high-risk BCR.About Non-Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer with High-Risk Biochemical Recurrence  In non-metastatic hormone- (or castration-) sensitive prostate cancer (nmHSPC or nmCSPC), no evidence of the cancer spreading to distant parts of the body (metastases) is detectable with conventional radiological methods (CT/MRI), and the cancer still responds to medical or surgical treatment designed to lower testosterone levels.1,2 Of men who have undergone definitive prostate cancer treatment, including radical prostatectomy, radiotherapy, or both, an estimated 20-40% will experience a biochemical recurrence (BCR) within 10 years.3 About 9 out of 10 men with high-risk BCR will develop metastatic disease, and 1 in 3 will die as a result of the recurrence.4 The EMBARK trial focused on men with high-risk BCR. Per the EMBARK protocol, patients with nmHSPC and high-risk BCR are those initially treated by radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy, or both, with a prostate-specific antigen doubling time (PSA-DT) ≤ 9 months. High-risk BCR patients with a PSA-DT of ≤ 9 months have a higher risk of metastases and death.5About XTANDI® (enzalutamide)XTANDI (enzalutamide) is an androgen receptor signaling inhibitor. XTANDI has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC), metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), and non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC). XTANDI is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 100 countries, including in the United States, European Union and Japan. One million patients have been treated with XTANDI globally.6U.S. Important Safety InformationXTANDI (enzalutamide) is indicated in the U.S. for the treatment of patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC).Warnings and PrecautionsSeizure occurred in 0.5% of patients receiving XTANDI in seven randomized clinical trials. In a study of patients with predisposing factors for seizure, 2.2% of XTANDI-treated patients experienced a seizure. It is unknown whether anti-epileptic medications will prevent seizures with XTANDI. Patients in the study had one or more of the following predisposing factors: use of medications that may lower the seizure threshold, history of traumatic brain or head injury, history of cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack, and Alzheimer's disease, meningioma, or leptomeningeal disease from prostate cancer, unexplained loss of consciousness within the last 12 months, history of seizure, presence of a space-occupying lesion of the brain, history of arteriovenous malformation, or history of brain infection. Advise patients of the risk of developing a seizure while taking XTANDI and of engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious harm to themselves or others. Permanently discontinue XTANDI in patients who develop a seizure during treatment.Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES): There have been reports of PRES in patients receiving XTANDI. PRES is a neurological disorder that can present with rapidly evolving symptoms including seizure, headache, lethargy, confusion, blindness, and other visual and neurological disturbances, with or without associated hypertension. A diagnosis of PRES requires confirmation by brain imaging, preferably MRI. Discontinue XTANDI in patients who develop PRES.Hypersensitivity: Reactions, including edema of the face (0.5%), tongue (0.1%), or lip (0.1%) have been observed with XTANDI in seven randomized clinical trials. Pharyngeal edema has been reported in post-marketing cases. Advise patients who experience any symptoms of hypersensitivity to temporarily discontinue XTANDI and promptly seek medical care. Permanently discontinue XTANDI for serious hypersensitivity reactions.Ischemic Heart Disease: In the combined data of four randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies, ischemic heart disease occurred more commonly in patients on the XTANDI arm compared to patients on the placebo arm (2.9% vs 1.3%). Grade 3-4 ischemic events occurred in 1.4% of patients on XTANDI versus 0.7% on placebo. Ischemic events led to death in 0.4% of patients on XTANDI compared to 0.1% on placebo. Monitor for signs and symptoms of ischemic heart disease. Optimize management of cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidemia. Discontinue XTANDI for Grade 3-4 ischemic heart disease.Falls and Fractures occurred in patients receiving XTANDI. Evaluate patients for fracture and fall risk. Monitor and manage patients at risk for fractures according to established treatment guidelines and consider use of bone-targeted agents. In the combined data of four randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies, falls occurred in 11% of patients treated with XTANDI compared to 4% of patients treated with placebo. Fractures occurred in 10% of patients treated with XTANDI and in 4% of patients treated with placebo.Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: The safety and efficacy of XTANDI have not been established in females. XTANDI can cause fetal harm and loss of pregnancy when administered to a pregnant female. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with XTANDI and for 3 months after the last dose of XTANDI.Adverse Reactions (ARs): In the data from the four randomized placebo-controlled trials, the most common ARs (≥ 10%) that occurred more frequently (≥ 2% over placebo) in XTANDI-treated patients were asthenia/fatigue, back pain, hot flush, constipation, arthralgia, decreased appetite, diarrhea, and hypertension. In the bicalutamide-controlled study, the most common ARs (≥ 10%) reported in XTANDI-treated patients were asthenia/fatigue, back pain, musculoskeletal pain, hot flush, hypertension, nausea, constipation, diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infection, and weight loss.In AFFIRM, the placebo-controlled study of metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) patients who previously received docetaxel, Grade 3 and higher ARs were reported among 47% of XTANDI-treated patients. Discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs) were reported for 16% of XTANDI-treated patients. In PREVAIL, the placebo-controlled study of chemotherapy-naive mCRPC patients, Grade 3-4 ARs were reported in 44% of XTANDI patients and 37% of placebo patients. Discontinuations due to AEs were reported for 6% of XTANDI treated patients. In TERRAIN, the bicalutamide-controlled study of chemotherapy-naive mCRPC patients, Grade 3-4 ARs were reported in 39% of XTANDI patients and 38% of bicalutamide patients. Discontinuations with an AE as the primary reason were reported for 8% of XTANDI patients and 6% of bicalutamide patients.In PROSPER, the placebo-controlled study of non-metastatic CRPC (nmCRPC) patients, Grade 3 or higher ARs were reported in 31% of XTANDI patients and 23% of placebo patients. Discontinuations with an AE as the primary reason were reported for 9% of XTANDI patients and 6% of placebo patients.In ARCHES, the placebo-controlled study of metastatic CSPC (mCSPC) patients, Grade 3 or higher AEs were reported in 24% of XTANDI-treated patients. Permanent discontinuation due to AEs as the primary reason was reported in 5% of XTANDI patients and 4% of placebo patients.Lab Abnormalities: Lab abnormalities that occurred in ≥ 5% of patients, and more frequently (&gt; 2%) in the XTANDI arm compared to placebo in the pooled, randomized, placebo-controlled studies are neutrophil count decreased, white blood cell decreased, hyperglycemia, hypermagnesemia, hyponatremia, and hypercalcemia.Hypertension: In the combined data from four randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials, hypertension was reported in 12% of XTANDI patients and 5% of placebo patients. Hypertension led to study discontinuation in &lt; 1% of patients in each arm.Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on XTANDI Avoid strong CYP2C8 inhibitors, as they can increase the plasma exposure to XTANDI. If co-administration is necessary, reduce the dose of XTANDI. Avoid strong CYP3A4 inducers as they can decrease the plasma exposure to XTANDI. If coadministration is necessary, increase the dose of XTANDI. Effect of XTANDI on Other Drugs Avoid CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, as XTANDI may decrease the plasma exposures of these drugs. If XTANDI is co-administered with warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), conduct additional INR monitoring.Please see Full Prescribing Information for additional safety information.About AstellasAstellas Pharma Inc. is a pharmaceutical company conducting business in more than 70 countries around the world.

Lies of conspiracy and malice repeated over and over again designed to generate a cycle of anger and hate and even violence,"" Biden said.That cycle, Biden added, has emboldened local jurisdictions to ban books, and ""the rule of law and our rights and freedoms to be stripped away.""Zeroing in on what he characterized as ""an extreme press,"" Biden at the same time joked that if he called Fox News ""honest, fair and truthful then I can be sued for defamation.""Earlier this month, Fox Corp settled a defamation lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems for $787.5 million in a case that centered around Fox's false claims that the 2020 presidential election had been manipulated in favor of Biden.And in a jab at former President Donald Trump, Biden quipped that comedian Roy Wood Jr, who also was a featured speaker at the dinner, had offered him $10 to keep his speech short.""That's a switch - a president being offered hush money,"" Biden said to laughter.On April 4, Trump was charged with 34 felony counts in a case involving an alleged $130,000 hush payment to an adult film star during his 2016 presidential campaign. Trump pleaded not guilty to all of the charges.PRESS FREEDOMThis annual dinner is attended by scores of reporters who cover the White House, along with many government officials. It also has become a showcase for entertainment industry stars to hobnob with Washington's power elite.Story continuesPresidents - although not Trump - normally attend the dinner and use their speeches as nods to the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment guaranteeing freedom of speech and the press.But the deep partisanship that has washed across American politics in recent years has at times turned the light-hearted dinner, known in Washington as ""the nerd prom,"" into a tense affair.In 2011, then-President Barack Obama used part of his speech to skewer Trump, who was sitting in the audience. At the time Trump had been spreading the falsehood that Obama was not born in the United States.More than a decade later, Trump was still hovering over this spring rite.Biden said he and his administration were ""here to send a message to the country and quite frankly to the world. A free press is a pillar....of a free society, not the enemy.""Trump used the term ""enemy of the people"" to refer to some journalists as a way of criticizing unflattering news coverage of his 2016 presidential campaign and his term in the White House.Before the dinner began, Biden held a private meeting with the family of Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter who was arrested on March 30 in Russia and subsequently charged with espionage. The U.S. government has said he is being wrongfully detained.""Journalism is not a crime,"" Biden said as he spoke of efforts underway to free reporters all over the world who are being held in detention.The president and First Lady Jill Biden also met with Brittney Griner, a professional basketball player released last December by Moscow after being imprisoned on charges of drug smuggling.After discussing the arduous efforts required to free Americans being held in foreign jails, Biden pivoted to a lighter portion of his speech, even turning his humor on himself.""I believe in the First Amendment,"" the 80-year-old president quipped, adding: ""Not just because my good friend Jimmy Madison wrote it.""James Madison was the fourth U.S. president, serving from 1809-1817.

Lies of conspiracy and malice repeated over and over again designed to generate a cycle of anger and hate and even violence,"" Biden said.That cycle, Biden added, has emboldened local jurisdictions to ban books, and ""the rule of law and our rights and freedoms to be stripped away.""Zeroing in on what he characterized as ""an extreme press,"" Biden at the same time joked that if he called Fox News ""honest, fair and truthful then I can be sued for defamation.""Earlier this month, Fox Corp settled a defamation lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems for $787.5 million in a case that centered around Fox's false claims that the 2020 presidential election had been manipulated in favor of Biden.And in a jab at former President Donald Trump, Biden quipped that comedian Roy Wood Jr, who also was a featured speaker at the dinner, had offered him $10 to keep his speech short.""That's a switch - a president being offered hush money,"" Biden said to laughter.On April 4, Trump was charged with 34 felony counts in a case involving an alleged $130,000 hush payment to an adult film star during his 2016 presidential campaign. Trump pleaded not guilty to all of the charges. (Reporting by David Shepardson, additional reporting by Leah Douglas; writing by Richard Cowan; Editing by Lincoln Feast)]"

Start your 7-day trial today.Tesla: You gotta spend money to make moneyShares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell over 3.5% in early trading Monday morning after the electric automaker said it had raised its capital expenditure forecast to between $7 billion and $9 billion this year, higher than its previous outlook of $6 billion to $8 billion.CEO Elon Musk has set a goal for Tesla to sell 20 million EVs in 2030, and the company is ramping up output at its factories in Berlin and Austin. It also has plans to open a gigafactory in Mexico as it pushes to expand global output.Part of Tesla’s expansion goal involves exporting the Model Y from Shanghai to Canada, as the company announced over the weekend.In Canada, the new version of the Model Y - and the more expensive long-range variant - both qualify for incentives of C$5,000 on purchase or a four-year lease, per a recent update to the Canadian government's website.Labor law violations at a Tesla service centerOn the downside, on Tuesday supervisors at Tesla’s Florida service center were found guilty of violating labor laws, according to reports.In 2021, the Orlando repair shop's management illegally silenced workers after some of them complained that new hires were being paid more, a U.S. labor board found.Tesla was ordered to cease and desist from violating workers' rights, and to post a notice of the violations in the service center and email it to employees.TSLA shares ended trading on Friday at $164.31. Almost even on a rollercoaster week that saw a harsh 4.76% drop on Wednesday.InvestingPro subscribers get Tesla headlines like these in real-time. Never miss another market-moving opportunity.Story continuesThings get muddy at RivianTesla EV rival, Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN), also found itself in hot water this week: The company is being sued by a Georgia resident claiming muddy runoff from the construction site of Rivian’s future factory has choked streams and ponds downstream in violation of federal environmental law, per a lawsuit filed in federal court this past week.The filing presents another potential legal hurdle for the EV startup.The Georgia resident said, “I do not have a problem with electric vehicles or economic development in appropriate places if done in a good way. However, Rivian and the contractors working on this project have shown disregard for the environment of our rural area, including our fields, forests, and streams.”Despite these developments, shares added some 4% for the week.Mullen concerned about concernsElsewhere in the EV space, on Friday Mullen (NASDAQ:MULN) told shareholders that it will undertake a comprehensive analysis to tackle potential market manipulation and illegal short selling in its shares.The move, for which Mullen is tapping outside council and Shareholder Intelligence Services LLC, addresses shareholder concerns regarding the automaker’s extraordinary trading volume and evidence of unusually high levels of failure to deliver on short sales, as reported to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.“As a fiduciary to its shareholders, the Company will do everything in its power to address any evidence of improper trading in Mullen securities,"" said Mullen in the press release, which InvestingPro subscribers got in real-time.Shares of MULN ended trading Friday at $0.0769. Down 28.7% for the week.GM bolts awayGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) announced the end of an era Tuesday, saying it will end production of its Chevrolet Bolt EV ""at the very end of the year.""The Bolt, GM's first mass-market EV, still accounts for more than 90% of all U.S. GM EV sales.The American automaker plans to invest $4 billion in its Orion Township Assembly plant, which is planned for production of its Chevrolet Silverado EV and electric GMC Sierra. GM said this facility, together with its Detroit-Hamtramck plant, will be able to build more than 600,000 electric trucks a year by late 2024.CEO Mary Barra added that when the Orion plant reopens in 2024, and reaches full production, ""employment will nearly triple.""Shares of GM ended trading Friday at $33.04. 3.65% off of its weekly high of $34.29 achieved on Monday.Streamlining StellantisFinally, Stellantis (NYSE:STLA), said Wednesday that it is offering voluntary exit packages to 33,500 U.S. employees in an effort to streamline operations. The automaker did not say how many total jobs it is looking to eliminate. However, the offer covers 31,000 U.S. hourly workers and about 2,500 salaried workers.Shawn Fain, president of the United Auto Workers union, called the move “a slap in the face to our members, their families, their communities and the American people who saved this company 15 years ago,"" during the country’s 2008 economic crisis.Shares of STLA ended trading on Friday at $16.63.

Citizens Financial Group (CFG) and US Bancorp (USB) were also reportedly invited.Bank of America decided against a bid, according to one of these people. US Bancorp also decided not to make an offer, according to a Bloomberg report.Some of these same banks came to First Republic's aid in March with $30 billion in uninsured deposits. They were reluctant last week to provide a second rescue on their own, fearing First Republic would be seized anyway.The FDIC gave banks a noon deadline Sunday, and people familiar with the bidding process interpreted it as the prelude to a government seizure of First Republic. Multiple reports Friday suggested that the FDIC would likely place First Republic into receivership.A sign to a First Republic Bank location is shown in San Francisco, Wednesday, April 26, 2023. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)The FDIC may be able to find a buyer among the big banks that is willing to take all of First Republic's deposits and perhaps some of its troubled assets, too. Sometimes the FDIC can sweeten such deals by agreeing to share future losses on loan portfolios, for example.Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna said on CBS's ""Face the Nation"" that the FDIC should take the ""lowest-cost alternative"" to dealing with First Republic. That is a reference to the regulator's mandate to accept the bid that will result in the least cost to the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund, which it uses to backstop all deposits up a limit of $250,000 per account.The biddersIf JPMorgan were to win, it would need the US government to provide an exception to a rule preventing any bank from making an acquisition providing it with more than 10% of all US deposits, Bloomberg reported. JPMorgan, the nation's largest bank, is already above that cap.Story continuesIts attempt to purchase First Republic places CEO Jamie Dimon at the center of a national banking crisis for the second time in 15 years.In 2008, he acted twice to help stabilize the financial system when JPMorgan purchased New York investment bank Bear Stearns in March of that year, getting a $29 billion backstop from the federal government, and then Seattle’s Washington Mutual in September of 2008. In the case of Washington Mutual, JPMorgan purchased its operations after regulators seized the Seattle thrift. It still is the nation’s largest-ever bank failure.The two deals turned JPMorgan into the nation’s biggest coast-to-coast bank and provided it with an even more powerful hand on Wall Street. They also saddled it with years of legal and regulatory headaches. Dimon has said if he could do it over again he would not have purchased Bear Stearns for those reasons.PNC, based in Pittsburgh, also went for an acquisition during the 2008 financial crisis that made it an even bigger player in the industry.Regulators encouraged it to make a bid for Cleveland rival National City, which had been weakened by its exposure to poor-performing mortgages. The deal announced in October 2008 for more than $5 billion made it one of the largest lenders in the country.PNC, which was sixth-largest bank as of Dec. 31, has made some sizable deals since 2008. In 2012 it purchased the U.S. retail banking subsidiary of Royal Bank of Canada for $3.47 billion and in 2021 it picked up the U.S. arm of Spain’s BBVA for $11.6 billion.The BBVA deal gave it roughly 60 branches in California, First Republic's home state, as well as locations in Texas. It was able to claim a presence in 29 of 30 of the top metropolitan statistical areas in the country.First Republic's troublesFirst Republic became the subject of a government bidding war after a fight for its survival that began in March when panic about the stability of regional lenders cascaded across the country. It tried to weather the turmoil by borrowing from the Federal Reserve and the Federal Home Loan Bank while also taking in $30 billion in uninsured deposits from 11 of the country's largest banks. JPMorgan provided $5 billion of the $30 billion.But First Republic's situation turned more serious Monday after it disclosed a loss of more than $100 billion in deposits. The drop was greater than expected and raised new concerns about the company's chances for survival. By Friday, First Republic's stock had dropped to $3.50, down 97% for the year. The bank's market value, once $40 billion, was just $640 million.Investors punished the stock, sending it down nearly 50% in one day and then nearly 30% on Wednesday. On Thursday it rose nearly 9%, before plunging again Friday by 43%.First Republic was founded in 1985 by Jim Herbert, and over the decades expanded rapidly as it attracted wealthy customers clustered on either coast by offering them large single-family mortgages at ultra-low rates along with personalized service.It went from $88 billion in assets at the end of 2017 to more than $200 billion at the end of 2022. It was the nation's 14th-largest lender as of Dec. 31.Then it, like many banks of its size, struggled to adapt to an aggressive campaign by the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates as a way of slowing inflation.The hikes lowered the value of the interest-rate sensitive assets on its balance sheet and helped create billions in unrealized losses, a hole that ultimately attracted the attention of investors and depositors following the fall of Silicon Valley Bank.The bank also had lots of uninsured depositors, making them a greater flight risk during the chaos that unfolded in March.When customers began pulling more than $100 billion, First Republic had to replace its deposit funding with more expensive borrowing from the Fed and the Federal Home Loan Bank system. Those borrowings, which peaked on March 15 at $138 billion, created another problem by placing more pressure on its profitability.First Republic developed a turnaround plan. It said Monday while releasing its first-quarter results that it planned to increase its amount of insured deposits, trim its borrowings, decrease its loan balances and reduce its workforce by 20-25%. Borrowings had dropped to $104 billion as of April 21 and the deposit outflows had slowed.But its disclosure about the amount of deposits lost in March, and the fact that the company decided not to take any questions from analysts, spooked investors.Short sellers also applied more pressure. Those with bets against First Republic have earned $1.37 billion year to date on a mark-to-market basis, according to S3 Partners. It is the most profitable short position among stocks thus far in 2023, according to S3.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Their thinking centered on the eventual comeback effect. Once government restrictions faded, people who developed cabin fever would want to get out of the house. Known colloquially as revenge travel, this phenomenon bolstered several travel-related enterprises.In 2023, it’s possible that we can see another last hurrah for certain travel stocks to buy. To be sure, consumer economy woes stemming largely from skyrocketing inflation dampened discretionary sentiment. Nevertheless, a recent CNBC article pointed out that Generation Z may provide a serious uptick. Though they may be short on cash, they desire experiences.Basically, Gen Z marches to their own beat. And unlike other generations, this age cohort desires the expanding of horizons, mostly because of social media exposure. Therefore, even with challenging circumstances, the below travel stocks may see an upside.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBKNGBooking Holdings$2,653.68HLTHilton Hotels$146.78LYVLive Nation$66.10DISDisney$98.17LUVSouthwest Airlines$31.15RCLRoyal Caribbean$60.41UBERUber Technologies$29.84Booking Holdings (BKNG)A photo of an excited woman riding on the back of a bike a man is driving.Source: OPOLJA / Shutterstock.comBased in Norwalk, Connecticut, Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) owns and operates several travel fare aggregators and travel fare metasearch engines. Arguably, its most popular site is Booking.com. Further, it operates websites in about 40 languages and 200 countries, making it popular with the global Gen Z crowd. Additionally, Booking.com’s commercials – which include relevant actors like Idris Elba – should appeal to younger travelers.Financially, Booking offers a very solid canvas. First, its balance sheet delivers many stable metrics, including an Altman Z-Score of 5.79, thus reflecting low bankruptcy risk. Operationally, the travel specialist prints a three-year revenue growth rate of 7.2%, above 77% of companies listed in the travel and leisure industry. Also, it’s highly profitable, posting a trailing-year net margin of 17.89, above 84.68% of its peers.Story continuesFinally, Wall Street analysts peg BKNG as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target is $2,789.57, implying nearly 4% upside potential. While it’s not one of the travel stocks to buy for becoming rich, BKNG should steer true.Hilton (HLT)a map of an ocean surrounded by beach leisure items to represent travel stocksSource: ShutterstockA world-renowned hospitality giant, Hilton (NYSE:HLT) doesn’t immediately stand out as one of the travel stocks for Gen Z. Typically focusing on a higher-income crowd, Hilton generated upside recently, perhaps on anticipating wealthier consumers vacationing. Since the start of the year, HLT gained over 18% of its equity value.Nevertheless, Hilton features some “fighter” brands, in particular Canopy by Hilton and Tru by Hilton. Focused on trendier, cozier lodgings but with an upscale vibe, the iconic hospitality firm is well-positioned to attract young customers. Moreover, Hilton’s competition in the home-rental space incurred some worrying trends. Thus, the hotel might be able to bank on its generally positive reputation.As with other lodging enterprises, Hilton’s financials reflect the impact of the Covid-19 crisis. However, the company’s consistently profitable, featuring an impressive net margin of 14.3%. Lastly, covering analysts peg HLT as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $155.10, implying nearly 5% upside potential.Live Nation Entertainment (LYV)Image of a singer at a rock concert.Source: kondr.konst/Shutterstock.comAn American global entertainment company, Live Nation Entertainment (NYSE:LYV) promotes, operates, and manages ticket sales for live entertainment in the U.S. and internationally. Because Gen Z desires experiences over products, Live Nation fundamentally offers a tangentially relevant idea among travel stocks to buy. Still, it might require some tolerance for risk.In particular, LYV gave up 39% of equity value in the past 365 days. Unfortunately, Live Nation hasn’t kept its nose clean from controversy, drawing the ire of Taylor Swift fans. Long story short, people couldn’t get access to the tickets, leading to many falling into the hands of scalpers. Still, scalping is basically one of the oldest capitalistic practices so the furor might fade away.To be sure, LYV ranks among the riskiest travel stocks to buy not because of the aforementioned controversy but because of its less-than-great financials. Nevertheless, it might be undervalued based on free cash flow (FCF). To close out, analysts peg LYV as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target comes out to $85.57, implying nearly 28% upside potential.Disney (DIS)Source: ShutterstockSpeaking of controversy, Disney (NYSE:DIS) finds itself in the middle of a national debate. Last year, the Magic Kingdom under then CEO Bob Chapek criticized Florida’s Parental Rights in Education bill. In response, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis seemingly retaliated, targeting Disney World’s special tax district in his state. As of now, the controversy continues to spill over, clouding what should be the happiest place on Earth.Nevertheless, I believe Disney should benefit from the uproar, making DIS one of the travel stocks to buy. As a diverse cohort, the Pew Research Center states that Gen Z unsurprisingly supports progressive political views. Therefore, you might see young folks visit Disney World out of spite of Governor DeSantis. Second, going to Disney World might be a bucket list item for millions of Gen Z members.On the financial front, Disney is a work in progress as it recovers from the pandemic. That said, it posts a solid three-year revenue growth rate of 2.7% (relative to the industry). Also, it’s consistently profitable. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg DIS as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target stands at $129.17, implying nearly 30% upside potential.Southwest Airlines (LUV)a jet takes off on a clear runway.Source: m.photo / Shutterstock.comDiving into the trickier names among travel stocks to buy, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) ordinarily should be an easy buy. However, Covid-19 did a number on the air travel industry. Moreover, Southwest incurred significant damage. During the winter holiday season last year, the airliner suffered a severe disruption, leading to hefty losses. More recently, the company got hit with delayed or canceled flights, reminding investors of the prior painful incident.Nevertheless, with Gen Z poised to travel in earnest this year, Southwest might deserve consideration among contrarian investors. Take aside its hiccups, the company ranks among the top discount airliners. Given that Gen Z is short on cash compared to other adult generations, LUV might fly higher.Financially, it’s clear that Southwest operates in recovery mode from the pandemic’s devastation. For instance, the company’s long-term sales trend sits in negative territory. Still, the market prices LUV at a forward multiple of 10.63, which is undervalued. Looking to the Street, analysts peg LUV as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $42.58, implying over 32% upside potential.Royal Caribbean (RCL)cruise stocks docked cruise ships. CCL stock.Source: Kokoulina / Shutterstock.comPlying its trade in an industry that represented the poster child of the devastation of the Covid-19 pandemic, Royal Caribbean (NYSE:RCL) might not be for everyone. Still, if we’re just talking about performances on a year-to-date basis, RCL ranks among the top travel stocks to buy. Since the January opener, shares gained more than 29% in equity value.Fundamentally, Royal Caribbean might do well among Gen Z because it provides myriad experiences. First, there’s the whole angle of going out to sea. During the cruise itself, patrons can enjoy several activities. When reaching the ultimate destination, adventures await on that journey as well. Put another way, cruises offer significant bang for the buck. Regarding the financials, let’s be clear about something: Gurufocus warns that it could be a value trap. Unsurprisingly, the pandemic and the subsequent government restrictions did a number on the industry.Still, analysts peg RCL as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target comes out to $84.11, implying over 33% upside potential.Uber Technologies (UBER)The Uber logo is displayed on a smartphone on top of a map background.Source: Proxima Studio / Shutterstock.comWhile it ranks among the riskiest travel stocks to buy, should Gen Z bolster the underlying sector, investors may want to consider Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER). The company that basically introduced the sharing-economy concept to the public, Uber delivers a compelling profile. Notably, the Pew Research Center stated in 2019 that more Americans have been using ride-hailing apps.Obviously, young people gravitate toward this arena but that’s a minor angle for travel stocks to buy. Much more significant is that young folks grew up using platforms like Uber. As well, since the service is tied to the Uber platform, you don’t really need to speak the language of the driver. Instead, you essentially upload your key stats, making the ride (generally speaking) a pleasant and convenient experience.However, Gurufocus also warns that UBER may be another value trap. Profitability and fiscal stability represent ongoing concerns. Nevertheless, if you want to take a shot, analysts peg UBER as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target pings at $48.19, implying over 56% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

(NYSE:APD) Could Be Worth Watching",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-air-products-chemicals-inc-110045984.html,1682852445,STORY,['APD'],"[Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (NYSE:APD) saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NYSE over the last few months. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s examine Air Products and Chemicals’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. View our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals Is Air Products and Chemicals Still Cheap?Air Products and Chemicals appears to be expensive according to my price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Air Products and Chemicals’s ratio of 28.99x is above its peer average of 13.67x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Chemicals industry. Furthermore, Air Products and Chemicals’s share price also seems relatively stable compared to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. If you believe the share price should eventually reach levels around its industry peers, a low beta could suggest it is unlikely to rapidly do so anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range.What does the future of Air Products and Chemicals look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Air Products and Chemicals' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 49%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? APD’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe APD should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on APD for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for APD, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.If you'd like to know more about Air Products and Chemicals as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

62,619fd631-d1ab-32f1-8c26-24cb4c8800b1,GPC,2023-04-30,Genuine Parts Company (NYSE:GPC) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 81%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/genuine-parts-company-nyse-gpc-133211397.html,1682775131,STORY,['GPC'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in Genuine Parts implies that they have significant influence over the company's share priceA total of 23 investors have a majority stake in the company with 50% ownership Insiders have bought recently To get a sense of who is truly in control of Genuine Parts Company (NYSE:GPC), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 81% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Genuine Parts. View our latest analysis for Genuine Parts ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Genuine Parts?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Genuine Parts. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Genuine Parts, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Genuine Parts is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 13% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.7% and 5.0% of the stock.After doing some more digging, we found that the top 23 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Genuine PartsWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Genuine Parts Company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$56m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 18% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Genuine Parts. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks for example - Genuine Parts has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Trump pleaded not guilty to all of the charges.PRESS FREEDOMThis annual dinner is attended by scores of reporters who cover the White House, along with many government officials. It also has become a showcase for entertainment industry stars to hobnob with Washington's power elite.Story continuesPresidents - although not Trump - normally attend the dinner and use their speeches as nods to the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment guaranteeing freedom of speech and the press.But the deep partisanship that has washed across American politics in recent years has at times turned the light-hearted dinner, known in Washington as ""the nerd prom,"" into a tense affair.In 2011, then-President Barack Obama used part of his speech to skewer Trump, who was sitting in the audience. At the time Trump had been spreading the falsehood that Obama was not born in the United States.More than a decade later, Trump was still hovering over this spring rite.Biden said he and his administration were ""here to send a message to the country and quite frankly to the world. A free press is a pillar....of a free society, not the enemy.""Trump used the term ""enemy of the people"" to refer to some journalists as a way of criticizing unflattering news coverage of his 2016 presidential campaign and his term in the White House.Before the dinner began, Biden held a private meeting with the family of Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter who was arrested on March 30 in Russia and subsequently charged with espionage. The U.S. government has said he is being wrongfully detained.""Journalism is not a crime,"" Biden said as he spoke of efforts underway to free reporters all over the world who are being held in detention.The president and First Lady Jill Biden also met with Brittney Griner, a professional basketball player released last December by Moscow after being imprisoned on charges of drug smuggling.After discussing the arduous efforts required to free Americans being held in foreign jails, Biden pivoted to a lighter portion of his speech, even turning his humor on himself.""I believe in the First Amendment,"" the 80-year-old president quipped, adding: ""Not just because my good friend Jimmy Madison wrote it.""James Madison was the fourth U.S. president, serving from 1809-1817.

The company's stock saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s examine Walt Disney’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. Check out our latest analysis for Walt Disney Is Walt Disney Still Cheap?Great news for investors – Walt Disney is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $131.90, but it is currently trading at US$103 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. However, given that Walt Disney’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from Walt Disney?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Walt Disney's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since DIS is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on DIS for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy DIS. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.Since timing is quite important when it comes to individual stock picking, it's worth taking a look at what those latest analysts forecasts are.

The payment will take the dividend yield to 3.4%, which is in line with the average for the industry. Check out our latest analysis for Exelon Exelon's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWe aren't too impressed by dividend yields unless they can be sustained over time. Based on the last payment, Exelon's earnings were much higher than the dividend, but it wasn't converting those earnings into cash flow. In general, we consider cash flow to be more important than earnings, so we would be cautious about relying on the sustainability of this dividend.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 32.0%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 53%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityThe company's dividend history has been marked by instability, with at least one cut in the last 10 years. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $2.10 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $1.44. This works out to be a decline of approximately 3.7% per year over that time. A company that decreases its dividend over time generally isn't what we are looking for.Dividend Growth Potential Is ShakyWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share is growing. Over the past five years, it looks as though Exelon's EPS has declined at around 12% a year. A sharp decline in earnings per share is not great from from a dividend perspective. Even conservative payout ratios can come under pressure if earnings fall far enough. Over the next year, however, earnings are actually predicted to rise, but we would still be cautious until a track record of earnings growth can be built.Exelon's Dividend Doesn't Look SustainableOverall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think Exelon will make a great income stock. While the low payout ratio is a redeeming feature, this is offset by the minimal cash to cover the payments. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. Just as an example, we've come across 3 warning signs for Exelon you should be aware of, and 1 of them shouldn't be ignored. Is Exelon not quite the opportunity you were looking for?

(NYSE:FIS) shares over the past year were recovered after the stock increased by 4.3% over the past week. The purchase, however, has proven to be a pricey bet, with losses currently totalling US$173k.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Fidelity National Information Services Fidelity National Information Services Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Independent Director Brian Shea made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$158k worth of shares at a price of US$68.72 each. That means that even when the share price was higher than US$58.72 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares. It's very possible they regret the purchase, but it's more likely they are bullish about the company. We always take careful note of the price insiders pay when purchasing shares. Generally speaking, it catches our eye when insiders have purchased shares at above current prices, as it suggests they believed the shares were worth buying, even at a higher price.In the last twelve months Fidelity National Information Services insiders were buying shares, but not selling. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeThere are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At Fidelity National Information Services Have Bought Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider buying at Fidelity National Information Services. In total, insiders bought US$1.4m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any sales whatsoever. That shows some optimism about the company's future.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of Fidelity National Information ServicesAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Fidelity National Information Services insiders own about US$98m worth of shares. That equates to 0.3% of the company. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.So What Do The Fidelity National Information Services Insider Transactions Indicate?It is good to see recent purchasing. And the longer term insider transactions also give us confidence. But we don't feel the same about the fact the company is making losses. When combined with notable insider ownership, these factors suggest Fidelity National Information Services insiders are well aligned, and that they may think the share price is too low. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Fidelity National Information Services.

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. In light of that, when we looked at Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Boston Scientific:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.074 = US$2.1b ÷ (US$32b - US$3.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).So, Boston Scientific has an ROCE of 7.4%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Medical Equipment industry average of 9.9%. Check out our latest analysis for Boston Scientific roceIn the above chart we have measured Boston Scientific's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.How Are Returns Trending?Unfortunately, the trend isn't great with ROCE falling from 13% five years ago, while capital employed has grown 114%. That being said, Boston Scientific raised some capital prior to their latest results being released, so that could partly explain the increase in capital employed. The funds raised likely haven't been put to work yet so it's worth watching what happens in the future with Boston Scientific's earnings and if they change as a result from the capital raise. Also, we found that by looking at the company's latest EBIT, the figure is within 10% of the previous year's EBIT so you can basically assign the ROCE drop primarily to that capital raise.Story continuesOn a side note, Boston Scientific has done well to pay down its current liabilities to 12% of total assets. So we could link some of this to the decrease in ROCE. What's more, this can reduce some aspects of risk to the business because now the company's suppliers or short-term creditors are funding less of its operations. Some would claim this reduces the business' efficiency at generating ROCE since it is now funding more of the operations with its own money.The Key TakeawayIn summary, Boston Scientific is reinvesting funds back into the business for growth but unfortunately it looks like sales haven't increased much just yet. Since the stock has gained an impressive 76% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.Boston Scientific does have some risks, we noticed   3 warning signs  (and 1 which makes us a bit uncomfortable)  we think you should know about.While Boston Scientific isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

This takes the annual payment to 2.9% of the current stock price, which is about average for the industry. View our latest analysis for Coca-Cola Coca-Cola's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWe like to see a healthy dividend yield, but that is only helpful to us if the payment can continue. Before making this announcement, Coca-Cola's was paying out quite a large proportion of earnings and 88% of free cash flows. This indicates that the company is more focused on returning cash to shareholders than growing the business, but we don't think that there are necessarily signs that the dividend might be unsustainable.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 31.5% over the next year. Under the assumption that the dividend will continue along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 62% which would be quite comfortable going to take the dividend forward.historic-dividendCoca-Cola Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $1.02, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $1.84. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 6.1% a year over that time. Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.Dividend Growth Could Be ConstrainedInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. Coca-Cola has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 49% per annum. EPS is growing rapidly, although the company is also paying out a large portion of its profits as dividends. If earnings keep growing, the dividend may be sustainable, but generally we'd prefer to see a fast growing company reinvest in further growth.Story continuesOur Thoughts On Coca-Cola's DividendOverall, this is probably not a great income stock, even though the dividend is being raised at the moment. Although they have been consistent in the past, we think the payments are a little high to be sustained. We would probably look elsewhere for an income investment.Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

""This means our customers are looking to stretch their budgets further and are focused on value. We saw some moderated spending on discretionary categories as well as shift to lower-priced items and healthy demand in everyday essentials, such as consumables and beauty.""""So far, we've gone through two of the three waves of restructuring and layoffs that we have planned for this year in our recruiting and our technical groups,"" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said. ""In May, we're going to carry out our third wave across our business groups. And this has been a difficult process, but after this is done, I think we're going to have a much more stable environment for our employees.""""We do see some of the pressures that give us reason to believe that our view on the macro outlook is accurate,"" McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski said. ""One, we are seeing a slight decrease in units per transaction. So things like did someone add fries to their order? How many items are they buying per order? We're seeing that go down in most of our markets around the world slightly, but it's still going down.""""And then the other thing is we continue to monitor very closely the acceptance of our pricing,"" Kempczinski added. ""I'm really proud of how our system has executed pricing in light of the double-digit inflation that we have been experiencing. But we are seeing in some places resistance to pricing, more resistance than we saw at the outset.

But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. One great example is UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) which saw its share price drive 109% higher over five years. Meanwhile the share price is 1.7% higher than it was a week ago.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. Check out our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, UnitedHealth Group achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 14% per year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 16% per year. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that UnitedHealth Group has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think UnitedHealth Group will grow revenue in the future.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of UnitedHealth Group, it has a TSR of 124% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that UnitedHealth Group shareholders are down 1.9% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 0.02%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 18% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with UnitedHealth Group , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Of course UnitedHealth Group may not be the best stock to buy.

(NYSE:DHI) Forecasts",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-just-made-meaningful-upgrade-120613149.html,1682769973,STORY,['DHI'],"[D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) shareholders will have a reason to smile today, with the analysts making substantial upgrades to this year's statutory forecasts. Consensus estimates suggest investors could expect greatly increased statutory revenues and earnings per share, with the analysts modelling a real improvement in business performance.Following the latest upgrade, the 14 analysts covering D.R. Horton provided consensus estimates of US$32b revenue in 2023, which would reflect a perceptible 5.2% decline on its sales over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are supposed to dive 27% to US$11.15 in the same period. Before this latest update, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$28b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$9.15 in 2023. So we can see there's been a pretty clear increase in analyst sentiment in recent times, with both revenues and earnings per share receiving a decent lift in the latest estimates. Check out our latest analysis for D.R. Horton earnings-and-revenue-growthWith these upgrades, we're not surprised to see that the analysts have lifted their price target 11% to US$121 per share. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. There are some variant perceptions on D.R. Horton, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$148 and the most bearish at US$98.00 per share. Analysts definitely have varying views on the business, but the spread of estimates is not wide enough in our view to suggest that extreme outcomes could await D.R. Horton shareholders.These estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the D.R. Horton's past performance and to peers in the same industry. These estimates imply that sales are expected to slow, with a forecast annualised revenue decline of 10% by the end of 2023. This indicates a significant reduction from annual growth of 18% over the last five years. Compare this with our data, which suggests that other companies in the same industry are, in aggregate, expected to see their revenue grow 1.4% per year. It's pretty clear that D.R. Horton's revenues are expected to perform substantially worse than the wider industry.Story continuesThe Bottom LineThe most important thing to take away from this upgrade is that analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates for this year, expecting improving business conditions. Fortunately, they also upgraded their revenue estimates, and are forecasting revenues to grow slower than the wider market. With a serious upgrade to expectations and a rising price target, it might be time to take another look at D.R. Horton.These earnings upgrades look like a sterling endorsement, but before diving in - you should know that we've spotted 2 potential risk with D.R. Horton, including recent substantial insider selling. For more information, you can click through to our platform to  learn more about this and the 1 other risk we've identified  .Of course, seeing company management  invest large sums of money in a stock can be just as useful as knowing whether analysts are upgrading their estimates.

The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. This means that investors who purchase Eaton's shares on or after the 5th of May will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 26th of May.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.86 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$3.24 per share. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Eaton has a trailing yield of approximately 2.1% on its current stock price of $167.12. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. View our latest analysis for Eaton Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Eaton paid out more than half (52%) of its earnings last year, which is a regular payout ratio for most companies. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. It paid out more than half (67%) of its free cash flow in the past year, which is within an average range for most companies.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies that aren't growing their earnings can still be valuable, but it is even more important to assess the sustainability of the dividend if it looks like the company will struggle to grow. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. With that in mind, we're not enthused to see that Eaton's earnings per share have remained effectively flat over the past five years. It's better than seeing them drop, certainly, but over the long term, all of the best dividend stocks are able to meaningfully grow their earnings per share.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Eaton has delivered an average of 8.5% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments.To Sum It UpHas Eaton got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Eaton has been unable to generate earnings growth, but at least its dividend looks sustainable, with its profit and cashflow payout ratios within reasonable limits. Overall it doesn't look like the most suitable dividend stock for a long-term buy and hold investor.Having said that, if you're looking at this stock without much concern for the dividend, you should still be familiar of the risks involved with Eaton. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Eaton you should know about.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

92,51743eaf-9405-3aad-b822-157ba891776b,PEP,2023-04-30,"Why PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) Looks Like A Quality Company",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-pepsico-inc-nasdaq-pep-130024650.html,1682773224,STORY,['PEP'],"[While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP).Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. See our latest analysis for PepsiCo How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for PepsiCo is:39% = US$6.6b ÷ US$17b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.39 in profit.Does PepsiCo Have A Good Return On Equity?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, PepsiCo has a better ROE than the average (17%) in the Beverage industry.roeThat is a good sign. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk . You can see the 5 risks we have identified for PepsiCo by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityCompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesCombining PepsiCo's Debt And Its 39% Return On EquityPepsiCo does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 2.43. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.SummaryReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.But note: PepsiCo may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.
