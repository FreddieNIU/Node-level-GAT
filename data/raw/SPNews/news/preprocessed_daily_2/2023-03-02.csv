This call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) For opening remarks and introductions, I would now turn -- like to turn the call over to Verisk's Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, you may go ahead.Stacey Jill BrodbarThank you, Devin, and good day, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our fourth quarter 2022 financial results. On the call today are Lee Shavel, Verisk's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Elizabeth Mann, Chief Financial Officer.The earnings release referenced on this call as well as our traditional quarterly earnings presentation and the associated 10-K can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. As set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone, today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance, including those related to our financial guidance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. Finally, I'd like to remind everyone that the financial results for recent dispositions are included in our consolidated and GAAP results, but are excluded from all organic constant currency growth figures. A reconciliation of reported and historic non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call is provided in our 8-K and today's earnings presentation posted on the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. However, we are not able to provide a reconciliation of projected adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin to the most directly comparable expected GAAP results because of the unreasonable effort and high unpredictability of estimating certain items that are excluded from projected non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, including, for example, tax consequences, acquisition-related costs, gain or loss from dispositions and other nonrecurring expenses, the effect of which may be significant. And now I would like to turn the call over to Lee Shavel.Story continuesLee M. ShavelGood morning, everyone, and thank you, Stacey, and thanks to you all for participating today. We've really been looking forward to this call because it's our first opportunity to reintroduce Verisk in our new insurance-focused configuration, to discuss the momentum in the fourth quarter and given all the structural changes, give you a forward view of our expected performance in 2023. We accomplished an extraordinary amount in 2022, so let me provide a brief summary. First, there's been a lot of structural change. In March, we sold 3E, our environmental health and safety business, for net cash proceeds of $575 million. In April, we sold Verisk Financial Services for net cash proceeds of approximately $500 million. And most recently in February, we sold Wood Mackenzie for approximately $3.1 billion. We've begun the process of returning a substantial majority of the after-tax proceeds of those transactions to shareholders through share repurchases as promised. Despite a challenging economic, geopolitical and financing environment, we were able to complete these transactions at attractive valuations through the strong underlying businesses, capable management teams and a well-organized sale process. Let's turn to governance change. Structural change wasn't the only transition at Verisk. We also made a number of governance changes that shareholders suggested. We are transitioning to a declassified Board with annual elections. We added 4 new directors with fresh perspectives and experiences: Jeff Dailey, Wendy Lane, Olumide Soroye and Kim Stevenson. We separated the Chairman and CEO role with the election of Bruce Hansen as our new Chair. I have to personally thank Bruce for his advice and leadership through my transition. As a former CEO, he's been a great coach to me as have been all of our directors. Let's turn to organizational change. Finally, organizationally, we've had substantial change. In addition to Scott Stephenson's retirement last year, Mark Anquillare stepping down in January and the addition of Elizabeth Mann as our CFO, we have made over a dozen changes in senior management. These have enabled the next generation of management to rise, bringing new energy and fresh perspectives on how we can make Verisk better. At the highest level, I have reconstituted our senior operating committee with 10 colleagues, 6 of whom are new to the committee, who represent a better balance of business unit leaders and corporate leaders for improved integration and coordination. I'm also proud that the committee represents 50% gender diversity and 40% ethnic diversity, a strong signal for our entire organization. We all share the common mission of creating value for our clients, employees and shareholders. With all this change, we were, of course, carefully watching for disruption with our employees and clients. While there is some understandable anxiety with any organizational change, the feedback from employees at 3 town halls, anonymous surveys and informal feedback has been very positive, with enthusiasm for our refocused strategy in insurance and new leadership. In particular, our purpose of working together to build global resilience for individuals, communities and businesses has resonated strongly with our employees as has our new cultural values of learning, caring and results. As I believe all of you can appreciate, what we accomplished in terms of structure and organizational change in 2022 was no foregone conclusion, and the delivery of a clear view of our insurance-only operations in our 10-K was a massively complex exercise. It required the effort, expertise and commitment of hundreds of our employees to accomplish. So I'd like to take this opportunity to personally thank all of our nearly 7,000 employees for their professionalism, commitment and understanding as we have undergone so much change in 2022. They are absolutely talented and critical to our future success. What we accomplished this year demonstrates what we're capable of ahead. On the client front, we have also received a positive response from many clients who appreciate our renewed insurance focus and desire to improve our relationships across their organizations. I experienced this firsthand at our Elevate Conference in Salt Lake City and dozens of client meetings and calls. Their feedback reinforces that while we have been a great product organization, we can be a much better client organization. And that's an area where I'm dedicating substantial time and leading from the front. I've spent most of my career as a client professional, and I'm excited to be returning to this particular role. Let's move to financial change. I won't steal Elizabeth's thunder on the financials, however, there are 2 elements that matter most to me in our 2022 performance and what we intend to achieve in 2023. First is our ability to continue to deliver strong revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth despite the changes and challenging environment in 2022 and the clear momentum in the fourth quarter results. We have clearly demonstrated what Verisk is capable of in the fourth quarter by delivering organic constant currency revenue growth of over 7% in the insurance-only business even after eliminating the impact of storms. I'd also note that fiscal year 2022, the insurance OCC revenue growth of 6.5% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 8% is a solid result for a year of substantial change and macroeconomic challenges and is a strong reflection of the stability of our business and a good foundation to build on to in 2023 and beyond. Second is our delivery of clear margin improvement consistent with the clear goals we set for the insurance-focused business of 300 to 500 basis points improvement from a normalized base of 50% to 51% in 2021. At 52.7% for the fourth quarter, we are on the cusp of delivering at the low end of our targeted range of 53% to 56% for 2024. And our guidance for 2023 is our adjusted EBITDA margin to be between 53% and 54%. Finally, we are providing expanded financial guidance for 2023 as a reflection of the complex structural changes in 2022 as well as an expectation of more predictable growth with our refocused business. This decision also reflects the input from many of our shareholders who ask for improved financial guidance. Naturally, it will come with the necessary caveats that we can't predict all contingencies but represents our best assessment of 2023 financial performance. So where does that leave us after all of these changes? We are, as of this moment, a new Verisk, new structurally, organizationally and with a reenergized and refocused purpose values. There's a lot that you'll be familiar with, including our insurance focus, industry centrality, strong market position, stable growth and strong margins. And some new elements that are expanding our growth opportunities in areas such as life assurance, marketing solutions and in our European businesses, including specialty business solutions, where we are improving workflows and efficiency in the Lloyd's nonstandard market. You will also see changes in our expense discipline to drive margin expansion and a new approach to providing financial guidance for the year ahead. Let's step back and take a moment to reframe our opportunity. The insurance industry is massive, complex and growing globally. Our clients face substantial technology, regulatory and macroeconomic challenges in a rapidly evolving environment. This is less an assertion than an often repeated sentiment that I hear from the leaders of our clients. One of my favorite client quotes was, ""Lee, we need Verisk's help to address this, but more importantly, the industry needs Verisk's help."" That crystallizes our opportunity and position. You'll hear at Investor Day from several clients that Verisk is considered a true business partner rather than a vendor and that we work together to collectively solve problems for the insurance industry. We create value for our clients through a simple economic mechanism. We invest in data, analytics and software at scale to address industry needs much more efficiently than individual companies can. We are addressing hundreds of billions of dollars of premiums and expense across the industry to improve revenue growth, risk outcomes, client experience, productivity and margins. These investments deliver real value to the industry and in turn, drive our growth, operating leverage and high incremental returns on capital. Much of this opportunity is realized by facilitating connectivity across the insurance ecosystem, hence, the theme of our annual report for 2022: connecting what matters. To connect, you must be central. You must be trusted, and you must understand the needs of the ecosystem. No company is better positioned than Verisk with our scale, relationships and expertise to create this value for the insurance industry. We're very proud of what we accomplished in 2022, but it was all to put us in this position where we can demonstrate our full potential, focused on serving the substantial and expanding needs of the insurance industry. With a reconfigured and energized organization bound together by a common purpose and values, we are very excited about the path ahead and can already feel the benefits of this better integrated and focused approach. This is the way. As our 2023 financial guidance implies and as you'll hear at our upcoming Investor Day, we believe this path will see continued growth, improving margins and strong returns on capital. I'll end with thanks to our shareholders, who encouraged us to consider new approaches and offered their perspectives directly or indirectly through surveys and our analyst community. We and our Board have listened carefully, and our actions and path ahead clearly reflect your input. We are here to expand the opportunity, execute on the plan and deliver value on your behalf. I can't imagine us being in a better position to do so, and we're off to a solid start. With that, I'll hand it over to Elizabeth to review our financial results for the quarter, the year and our financial guidance for 2023.Elizabeth MannThanks, Lee, and good day to everyone on the call. Before I start with the fourth quarter results, I have a few reminders for everyone. First, all consolidated and GAAP numbers are negatively impacted by the dispositions of 3E and Verisk Financial Services. This effect will continue through the first quarter of 2023 when we will anniversary those transactions. Second, as we described previously, due to its materiality, Wood Mackenzie is accounted for as discontinued operations beginning this quarter. And its results are not included in our revenue or adjusted EBITDA results in either the current period or the prior period. Third, in the earnings presentation now posted on the Investors section of our website, we have included certain pro forma quarterly financial metrics, removing the operational results of all our divestitures as well as a reconciliation to our historical reported results, which we hope you will find helpful. Turning now to the financial results. I'm pleased to share that we had a strong finish to 2022. For the fourth quarter on a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue was $630 million, up slightly versus the prior year, reflecting growth in insurance, offset by the impact of the VFS and 3E dispositions. Income from continuing operations was $216 million, while diluted GAAP earnings per share attributable to Verisk was $1.37. Moving to our organic constant currency results adjusted for nonoperating items as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, we are very pleased with our operating results, which demonstrated strong sequential improvement relative to the third quarter as a broad-based recovery across our business contributed to the strongest quarter of the year. In the fourth quarter, OCC revenues grew 8.1%, with growth of 6.5% in underwriting and rating and 11.9% in claims. This quarter's results included $5.6 million in storm-related revenue associated with Hurricane Ian. Excluding the storm-related revenues, OCC revenue would have grown 7.1%. Our subscription revenues, which comprise 80% of our total revenue in the quarter, grew 7.2% on an OCC basis. We saw broad-based growth across most of our businesses with strength in core underwriting, property estimating solutions, extreme events, antifraud and life insurance solutions. We did experience a modest negative impact from the liquidations in Florida. As we noted in previous calls, Florida has been a trouble spot for the insurance industry, and the losses from Hurricane Ian add complications. In 2022, the market saw 6 liquidations. And so far in '23, we have seen one company placed into receivership after higher-than-expected losses from Hurricane Ian pushed the carrier into insolvency. We continue to work to offset this headwind through engagement with our customers by helping them adapt to Florida's new roof coverage rules and by better segmenting risk using both new and existing sources such as our roof age data and aerial imagery. Our analytics have been integrated into our LightSpeed platform and can help customers leverage data earlier in their quoting process, ensuring they underwrite risk appropriately as well as help drive nonrate action for in-force policies. Transactional OCC revenue growth of 12.1%, representing 20% of total revenue in the fourth quarter, also improved from the third quarter, reflecting the revenues associated with Hurricane Ian. Adjusting for the storm impact, transactional growth was a healthy 8.2%, comprised of continued strong recovery in international travel, strong sales of life insurance solutions and a modest contribution from our workers' compensation business, which is improving though continues to be below pre-pandemic levels. This was offset in part by continued weakness across auto underwriting and marketing solutions. On the auto underwriting side, we continue to see cyclical softness across our auto underwriting and marketing solutions as carriers are dealing with the impact of rising inflation and increasing loss ratios. To that end, carriers have pulled back on underwriting new auto policies as well as on marketing spending to drive new policy volume and customer acquisition. Carriers are working to reset pricing, which we think could take another 6 to 12 months to truly take effect. To help our customers bridge this uncertain time and drive growth for Verisk, we are working with them to help identify ways to improve profitability with targeted nonrate actions that minimize premium leakage. We are actively engaging with customers about our risk check renewal product, which allows insurance -- which allows insurers to analyze an entire book of business with minimal IT resources and pinpoint policies that require attention. Moving now to our adjusted EBITDA results. OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 12.9% in the fourth quarter, reflecting core operating leverage and the impact of certain cost reduction actions we have taken in connection with our margin expansion objectives. Total adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes both organic and inorganic results, was 52.7%, up 210 basis points from the reported results in the prior year, reflecting the benefit from recent dispositions, strong cost and operational discipline, the impact of certain cost reduction actions and the high incremental margins associated with storm-related revenue. This level of margin also includes a number of margin headwinds, including approximately 110 basis points from recent acquisitions as well as 80 basis points from the headwinds from our ongoing technological transformation and higher T&amp;E expenses. In addition, this quarter included certain onetime or nonoperating expenses including severance, FX impact and a decrease in our pension credit, which collectively negatively impacted margins by 190 basis points. Finally, if you compare the fourth quarter margins on a pro forma basis for all divestitures, the 4Q 2022 margins of 52.7% represent an 80 basis point margin expansion from 51.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021 pro forma. Reflecting on our objective to deliver 300 to 500 basis points of margin improvement in 2024 from a normalized base of 50% to 51% in 2021, we took great strides in 2022, with full year adjusted EBITDA margin of 52% on a pro forma basis reflecting approximately 140 basis points of margin expansion associated with our operational excellence focus. To date, we have made decisions and taken actions to address more than 60% of the run rate cost savings we are targeting. The impact of those actions will be realized through 2024 with about 30% of the cumulated expected cost savings already achieved in the reported results in 2022. Our business continues to demonstrate the operating leverage embedded in our data analytics business model, and we have confidence in our ability to deliver on the objective in 2024. Interest expense. Interest expense totaled $41 million for the fourth quarter compared to $30.2 million in the prior year. For the full year, interest expense totaled $139 million versus $127 million in 2021. This increase in interest expense is related to higher balances on our revolving credit facility as well as higher interest rates. We have paid off all borrowings under our credit facility as of February 2023. And in the near term, we'll look to establish a go-forward balance sheet for the business, staying within our targeted leverage range of 2 to 3x adjusted EBITDA. Taxes. Our reported effective tax rate was 9.9% compared to 16.8% in the prior year quarter. This lower tax rate included a onetime benefit of approximately $30 million, which was primarily the result of transaction benefits related to our Wood Mackenzie divestitures, offset in part by lower stock compensation benefits versus the prior year period. For the full year '22, our effective tax rate was 17.5% as compared to 22.8% in the prior year, including approximately $67.7 million in benefits related to all our dispositions throughout the year. The net effects of these transaction-related tax benefits was a reduction in our full year effective tax rate of 5.4%. Adjusted net income and diluted adjusted EPS. Adjusted net income increased 14% to $225 million, and diluted adjusted EPS increased 18% to $1.43 for the fourth quarter '22. These changes reflect organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions, a lower effective tax rate and a lower average share count. Capital returns. During the fourth quarter, we returned $514 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends as our strong cash flow allows us to consistently return capital to shareholders while also investing in our business. In particular, included in that amount is $366 million of share repurchases we have completed since the announcement of the Wood Mackenzie transaction back in November. In the coming days, we intend to enter into an additional $2.5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement for a total capital return of $2.87 billion associated with the transaction proceeds. This is consistent with our plan to return the majority of the proceeds from the Wood Mackenzie divestiture to shareholders via share repurchases. We continue to expect the dilution from the transaction to be within the 4% to 6% range. Looking ahead to 2023, as Lee mentioned, we have listened to shareholder feedback, and we'll now be providing annual financial guidance. We have posted a summary of all guidance measures in the earnings deck on the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. Specifically, for 2023, we expect consolidated revenue to be in the range of $2.59 billion to $2.63 billion versus $2.437 billion in 2022 pro forma. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.37 billion to $1.42 billion versus $1.266 billion in 2022 pro forma and adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 53% to 54%. Working further down the P&amp;L, we expect fixed asset D&amp;A to be between $175 million and $195 million and intangible amortization to be approximately $70 million. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to FX variability, the timing of purchases, the completion of projects and future M&amp;A activity. We also expect capital expenditures to be between $200 million and $230 million as we continue to invest organically behind our highest return on investment opportunities. These include a modernization of our core line services to digitize our industry standard offering and enable expansion into new workflows that improve productivity for the industry. We are also investing in an upgrade of our financial and human capital systems that will enable future efficiencies once implemented. As previously communicated, we expect the tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%, bringing adjusted earnings per share to a range of $5.20 to $5.50. This range represents strong double-digit growth rates on EPS after normalizing for the impact of transaction tax benefits in 2022. Before I turn the call over to Lee, I just want to remind everyone that we will be hosting an Investor Day on March 14 here in Jersey City, where we will provide more transparency and clarity on our strategic profile, growth drivers and long-term financial targets. And now I will turn the call back over to Lee for some closing comments.Lee M. ShavelThanks, Elizabeth. In summary, we are excited to focus all our attention, talent and resources on the global insurance industry where we can deliver substantial value to our clients through improved decision-making and operational efficiency. We will be engaged more intensively as a strategic technology partner to our clients and the broader insurance industry to identify and develop ways for Verisk to support their objectives. With our scale, relationships and expertise, we are well positioned to help make those connections in this period of accelerated change for the industry and by extension, to the people and communities they serve. Our motivating purpose is to work together with our clients in building resilience for individuals, communities and businesses globally. Combined with our focused business model and unique market position, this is a formula that will deliver value to our shareholders through growth and returns. We continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk. (Operator Instructions) With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.Toni Michele KaplanCongrats on the results today and particularly, I think your progress on the margin front. You talked about hitting 53% to 54% margin in '23. And as you mentioned, that will essentially be at the low end of the '24 target range. Does this change your strategy around investment, meaning does this allow you to go more aggressively after growth opportunities, just given that your margin is in a really solid place?Lee M. ShavelThanks, Toni. I'm going to hand it over to Elizabeth to respond.Elizabeth MannThanks, Toni. I don't think it changes our overall strategy. We are committed to the targets delivering in '24. We're happy to be in the low end of that range already ahead of schedule. But we'll maintain that level of focus on margin while still maintaining investment in the business as we've been balancing so far.Lee M. ShavelYes. And Toni, I'll just add, I think we're very comfortable in our ability to meet those targets, to build on that while still continuing to support the growth objectives that we have for the business.OperatorOur next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.Keen Fai TongYou've reaffirmed your commitment to deliver 300 to 500 bps of EBITDA margin improvement from a normalized base of 50% to 51% in 2021. Recently, you restated historical financials suggesting an insurance-only Verisk has normalized EBITDA margins of approximately 52%. Can you discuss upside potential to your 53% to 56% 2024 target for EBITDA margins?Elizabeth MannYes. Thanks. We remain committed to that range. Right now, I'm here talking about 2023. I think there's been some headwinds in '22 that we've talked about previously as well as some benefits to the business. So on balance, we're committed to the range.OperatorOur next question comes from Heather Balsky with Bank of America.Heather Nicole BalskyI'll continue the streak of margin questions on the Q&amp;A and just ask, if you could help us just bridge a little bit more what gets you to 53% to 54%, what's coming from the savings? What's sort of the impact from the stranded costs and some of the other chunkier lines that kind of get you from '22 to '23?Elizabeth MannYes. Let me talk a little bit about that. If you start with the baseline '22 of 52%, that pro forma, that already includes the headwinds from stranded costs, and it includes most of the headwinds from recent M&amp;A. As we move forward on that, there is still a little bit more headwinds from those previously identified items in our baseline, call it about 30 basis points collectively from ongoing impact of the T&amp;E normalization, the cloud and technology investments, including some of the financial and human capital systems that we talked about. So call those investments 30 basis points. There's probably still 30 basis points of headwind also from the pension credit, which we know today based on current assumptions, will be -- will continue to be a drag in 2023. Offsetting that, you'll see -- so that's about 60 basis points. Collectively, that's offsetting about 150 to 250 basis points of sort of core operating leverage. I haven't broken that down between operating leverage, growth impact and the cost savings target, but those are all included in that 150 to 250 basis points, bringing us to the net of 100 to 200 basis points margin expansion.OperatorOur next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets.Ashish SabadraChanging gears and moving to the top line, really strong OCC growth in the quarter. I was wondering for your 2023 guidance, what is the organic constant currency assumption for that guidance range? And then as we think about a quarterly cadence, I was wondering if you could provide any color on that? And any color on the puts and takes as we think about auto underwriting coming back, worker comp improving as well as any color on pricing trends and comping some of the Florida insurance headwinds. So any incremental color...Lee M. ShavelThat's like a 4-part question. So let's choose -- I would consider that multiple choice.Elizabeth MannI'll try to hit the main points there. So on the OCC revenue growth, we haven't given that on a forecasted basis. We will report that out as the quarters develop. The one piece I'll slide for you, for 2023, the acquisitions that roll in from inorganic to organic are not -- don't create a major swing in the growth rates. And obviously, FX is -- we're not predicting. In terms of, you asked about the quarterly cadence of how that plays out, there's nothing that we see here today that would imply a meaningful swing in the quarters from a financial perspective. If you look at the OCC comparability results to 2022, those could have some swings just based on the swings in '22.OperatorOur next question comes from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies.Hans Peter HoffmanThis is Hans Hoffman on for Stephanie. Congrats on the strong quarter. Just wanted to talk a bit about your strategy within insurance, specifically internationally and just how organic growth is trending there. And then just kind of maybe as part of that, are there any acquisitions in the international pipeline that could help you gain further critical mass there going forward?Lee M. ShavelYes. Thank you for the question. Let me try to address the components of that. So I think I outlined in my comments the general strategy where we are looking to make investments in data or technology that solve industry problems that we can monetize across that industry. And that strategy really holds across the business. Internationally where we've had a very solid success of finding businesses that have established products in international context, and I'll use our acquisition of Sequel as an example. We have taken that business, we have found ways to support that with addition of other components such as a rate-making component or a binding component in that business that add value to the total offering for our business, thereby integrating components for the market participants in that ecosystem. We will continue to look for opportunities to leverage those types of additions as well as data sets and functionality that we have within the U.S. business. We recently made an acquisition in Sweden, and you may be familiar with both our acquisitions of ACTINEO in Germany and Opta where we're deploying similar strategies. And generally, across our international businesses, we have been able to deliver growth faster than our overall rate and generally in the double-digit range because of the penetration opportunities we have within those marketplaces. So hopefully that ties together both, our general strategy and how it applies internationally and the contributions to growth from each of those elements.OperatorOur next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird.Jeffrey P. MeulerI want to ask about the pickup in claims underlying growth normalized for the discrete storm revenue. I mean it's a pretty big step-up, so I'm just trying to understand, were there any other like onetime benefits in the quarter? Is this mostly about COVID recovery because the factors you cited were things like recovery in international travel and workers' comp? Or what I'm really looking for, was there like a pickup in like cross-selling and upselling trends in the business, and the stepped-up growth rate could be sustainable?Lee M. ShavelThanks, Jeff. So I would say the general dimension has been that it has been the normalization of activity across the business in a couple of fronts, driving activity being one of that. I think that has had a positive improvement in some of our antifraud categories. Elizabeth made reference to some of the return to growth in our workers' comp businesses. And I think on the property estimating side, I think we've seen higher and more normalized levels of activity. Some of that -- well, excluding the actual storm revenue, I just think we have seen more activity. I'd ask my colleague, Maroun Mourad, who leads our claims business if there's anything that he'd like to add to that, the general pickup that we've seen in the claims business.Maroun S. MouradThank you. Thank you, Lee. Thank you, Jeff, for the question. We've been experiencing overall healthy growth across all the different claims businesses that we've got. So in addition to the comments made by Elizabeth and Lee around property estimating solutions as well as the casualty workers' comp business, we continue to see new customer engagements that is resulting in very healthy growth activity across our antifraud suite of solutions. Thank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.Alexander Eduard Maria HessThis is Alex Hess on for Andrew Steinerman. I want to ask maybe a bit about retention rate and the pressures you saw from Florida. And then as a sort of second part to that question, any sort of operational or balance sheet efficiency statistics you can provide for the stand-alone insurance Verisk? So to that Florida question, maybe what are -- what was your retention rate in '23 and then -- in '22? And what was it sort of ex Florida?Lee M. ShavelSo Alex, thanks. I would say we are experiencing continued high client retention rates. And I think what we talked about, there's been one liquidation in Florida. And so that's something that we have called out. But I don't think -- and I look to my colleague, Neil Spector, here to see if there are, other than that situation, whether we have seen any changes in our overall retention on the underwriting side of the business. So I think those remain very solid. We're watching it carefully because of the risks in Florida. But to date, I think we've only had one liquidation. Neil, anything you'd like to add?Neil SpectorThanks, Lee. No, I think you summarized it well. I would just say that while there are potential for liquidations down there, there's also new formations of companies that come into the market because there's need for coverage, which gives us opportunities. So just -- it isn't a one-way flow of businesses exiting, there's businesses entering as well, which helps offset some of that.Lee M. ShavelThank you. And the question, I don't know, on the operational and the balance sheet, Elizabeth, I think, can respond.Elizabeth MannYes. Thanks for that, Alex. We haven't -- I don't have any specific stats pulled out on that right now. But I think in general, the insurance business is the most cash flow generative and sort of the most capital efficient of our former businesses. It generates strong free cash flow, negative working capital characteristics and high kind of yield on EBITDA.Lee M. ShavelAnd when I think about balance sheet efficiency, Alex, I think the most striking thing is that with these dispositions, we have released a lot of capital that was not generating as high a return as in our core insurance businesses. And so I think you will see that in the return on invested capital, particularly as we utilize the proceeds to repurchase shares. That's probably the most significant balance sheet efficiency in my mind.OperatorOur next question comes from Greg Peters with Raymond James.Charles Gregory PetersLee, in your comments, you acknowledged all the changes that the company has gone through over the last year. Now that you're laser-focused on the insurance piece, can you talk about how you're tracking customer satisfaction? Specifically, is there something like a comprehensive customer survey that you're using, where you can collect unfiltered feedback rather than just looking at retention numbers and feedback you get at conferences?Lee M. ShavelYes. Great. Thank you very much. And you really touched on something that we -- I think we have a good system that we undertake a survey and an NPS scoring twice a year. In 2022, that is in the mid-40s, which is consistent with where we've been before the pandemic and through the pandemic. And I think we saw an increase in that during the pandemic as a function of kind of a general lift from working from home, from our clients, some of the features that we offered through client experience that were well received but still a very solid number. So we undertake that, but we also have customer experience unit that is always looking to gauge the feedback that we receive from our clients on product experience. So at that level, we're trying to provide a number of means for them to communicate anonymously their level of satisfaction. I would also say anecdotally, we have intensified our efforts to engage at a senior level, particularly at C-suite with how we are providing value and solving problems for them. The feedback of knowing their feedback to our renewed focus on just the insurance industry has been very positive. The outreach from some clients where we haven't had a strong relationship has been very positive, and we've actually seen a higher level of engagement from them as a result. So we're looking at that across -- at different layers. And so far, I think the response has been positive, and we'll continue to build on that.OperatorOur next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities.Andrew William JeffreyI appreciate all the sort of succinct summation of the changes you made in your business and the guidance, I agree, that's really helpful. We also appreciate all the call outs of the business drivers. Now that you're a pure-play, can you -- are there some areas where you think Verisk has particular ability to focus and accelerate growth? I'm thinking about life or extreme event modeling as we think more about climate change. I just wonder if there's more of a laser focus on areas we think Verisk has the ability to really leverage assets and potentially accelerate top line.Lee M. ShavelYes. Andrew, thank you very much for the question. And I will -- I'll do my best to address it here, but I think we're really excited about drilling into that at Investor Day. So forgive me for another advertisement for Investor Day, but I really think that it will be a great opportunity for you to hear not only what I have to say strategically, but also hear it directly from the business and the investments that we're making. So I'm going to try to limit it to 3. The first is, as you referenced, in new areas for us like life insurance and in marketing that are current needs for those businesses that we have the opportunity to penetrate the existing insurance industry or segments of the insurance industry that we have not served before are already delivering significant growth that enhances our overall growth rate. So we will continue to look for those opportunities. The second level is internationally, as we've described, also a penetration opportunity where our international businesses are growing faster. They represent an opportunity for us to deliver some of the data, the analytics and technology into those markets as well as developing new solutions. And so the success that we've had in U.K. we hope to follow up with success in Canada and in Continental Europe with some of our work there. And that's not just acquisition-driven. It's also integrating some of the features and products that we have in the U.S. And the third element that I would just point to is I think that we have a broader opportunity based upon the conversations that we've -- that I've had with other CEOs and other C-suite clients around the opportunity to improve the efficiency of the broader insurance industry. I think to my earlier point, I think we've been great on the products that are focused on specific underwriting or specific claims applications. But our ability to tie those solutions together, potentially find shared services or more automated solutions to address the hundreds of billions of dollars of expenditure by the industry is an area that has a very strong reception from the clients we've dealt with. One element that I'll tease that has gotten a lot of interest is our ability to digitize more of the forms elements and the standard policy language, which, as you can imagine, can sometimes expand exponentially with tweaks to that language. Being able to manage and track that on a digitized basis is part of the investment that we're making in our core lines reimagine. Those are the types of solutions where we can, given our centrality, given the data sets that we have, really revolutionize the way that, that process is being handled, creating efficiencies across the industry as a whole. So that hopefully gives you a little bit of a start in terms of where we think we can find new areas to potentially expand that growth rate.OperatorOur next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.Jeffrey Marc SilberI wanted to focus on your auto underwriting and marketing that you talked about. Actually a 2-part question. Can you just remind us what your exposure is there? What it was as a percentage of revenues, pre-pandemic, what it is now? And what gives you the confidence that these companies can really reset premiums within the next 6 to 12 months?Lee M. ShavelYes. So one, I'm going to address the second part first. And then just also ask Elizabeth or Stacey to kind of refresh me on the overall exposure element. But I think we're confident because we are already seeing in a number of regulatory areas that those rate increases are being approved. There was a -- previously, a bit of a delay, I think, because of elections that probably created some delay from a regulatory standpoint. We're now seeing those begin to emerge, I think, a recognition that the inflationary costs that the auto insurers have borne is something that is legitimate, needs to be factored into overall pricing. There are some areas that I think we're concerned about, particularly in California and approvals on that front. But I think we're getting a sense of momentum in those rate increases. And from an overall exposure standpoint...Elizabeth MannYes, we've said that the auto -- exposure to the auto industry is about 10% of our total insurance revenue.Jeffrey Marc SilberAnd that's what it was? Or that's what it is now?Elizabeth MannIn general.Lee M. ShavelYes. It has been at that level consistently. It hasn't changed materially.OperatorOur next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.Manav Shiv PatnaikAnd first, thank you so much for the guidance details and providing that. I just had a question around the pricing environment. If you could just talk about what pricing -- how pricing fits, I guess, this year and then looking out into '23, if you should expect any incremental improvement versus that.Lee M. ShavelYes. Thanks, Manav. So as you can appreciate, we have hundreds of products. And so each has a different pricing dynamic reflecting what we view as the demand elements for that, the value that we provide. And first and foremost, our primary pricing philosophy is driven by the value of the product and what it's delivering. And so we are often trying to calibrate pricing to be a fraction of the value that the client received. And when we think about our growth from pricing, it is primarily a reflection of our ability to deliver value to clients. Now we also recognize that there is an element in our pricing that is tied to net premium growth. We are -- that is a factor. It has been a decreasing factor over time as other products not tied to that have grown faster. But that is an element where we are expecting some lift, given generally stronger premium growth as we've seen in different part of the businesses. And then finally, I would say going into 2023, reflecting somewhat of the higher inflationary environment and the imposed costs on us from a compensation standpoint, we have included a somewhat, in certain instances, a higher inflationary component to reflect that reality as we think most of our clients have done in similar situations. So all of those factor into the guidance from a revenue standpoint as it relates to pricing. I would say, however, that while pricing and particularly the value-added element is the most important component, we do also expect contributions from new customers, from upsell with existing products, from growth from our new initiatives and our higher growth to contribute a like amount to our overall growth rate.OperatorOur next question comes from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair.Andrew Owen NicholasI wanted to ask just in terms of kind of the top and bottom end of revenue guidance, is it fair to say that the recovery of some of the headwinds you've called out the past couple of quarters on auto underwriting, marketing solutions and the sort are the primary drivers to the top and bottom end? Or are there other kind of puts and takes to call out that underlie the '23 guidance range?Elizabeth MannYes. Good question. Yes, as you flagged, kind of one of the swing factors between the top and bottom end would be the recovery of some of the more sensitive -- macro sensitive parts of our business like auto. In general, with the 80% subscription revenue, there's a lot of stability in the overall. One or two other environment-related factors that I would point out that could contribute to the difference in that, the top and bottom end of that range as you say, the amount of storm-related revenue is inherently unpredictable, obviously. We have included some assumptions for that in the budget but a sort of moderate assumption in there. And then there's one or two other sort of macro-related factors like the level of [cat log] activity and other things that could contribute to that range.OperatorOur next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.Alexander KrammQuick cleanup question, and sorry if I missed it, I dropped earlier. But I don't think you guided on interest expense, and you gave us a couple of pieces here in terms of paying off some of the debt already in February. So can you just be a little bit more specific on what we should be expecting there? Because I think some people are struggling getting from your EBITDA guide to EPS.Elizabeth MannYes, it's a great question. We're not giving a specific number on interest guidance, but I can give you some dimensionality to it. I think if you look at our fourth quarter interest expense, that was obviously higher than it was kind of on a run rate basis for the full year. I think for 2023, we would assume that the interest expense is slightly less than it was in the fourth quarter annualized but higher than it was for kind of the full year of '22 or between those 2 factors.OperatorOur final question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank.Faiza AlwyAnd I just want to say congratulations on executing all the changes in 2022, and thank you from me also on providing guidance. Today, I wanted to just go back on margins and specifically about the 2024 goals. The range is still pretty wide, and wanted to get a sense of what are some of the factors that would take you to the low end of the range versus the high end of the range.Elizabeth MannYes. Thanks, Faiza, for the question. Really, we're here today to talk about the quarter and the 2023 view. So sort of longer-term discussions, we'll talk about at Investor Day.Lee M. ShavelYes. And Faiza, I would just say, look, we clearly have an objective of delivering on that, and we want to demonstrate our ability to improve that margin. Longer term, I think what we'll talk about are the trade-offs between investment and margin and the value that the investment can deliver in terms of growth and returns. I think that's not a new dynamic. That's something that we have always worked to try to find a balance to demonstrate margin strength, but also not at the cost of delivering where we think value is created most significantly, which is through growth and returns. But we are fully committed to delivering on the guidance that we set initially of that 53% to 56% range, and we're working to deliver as strong a result as we possibly can.OperatorThere are no further questions at this time, which concludes today's conference. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.]"

However, the company's fundamentals look pretty decent, and long-term financials are usually aligned with future market price movements. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Texas Instruments'  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. View our latest analysis for Texas Instruments How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Texas Instruments is:60% = US$8.7b ÷ US$15b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.60 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Texas Instruments' Earnings Growth And 60% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that Texas Instruments has a significantly high ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 19% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. This likely paved the way for the modest 16% net income growth seen by Texas Instruments over the past five years. growthStory continuesWe then compared Texas Instruments' net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 28% in the same period, which is a bit concerning.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Texas Instruments is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is Texas Instruments Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Texas Instruments has a significant three-year median payout ratio of 54%, meaning that it is left with only 46% to reinvest into its business. This implies that the company has been able to achieve decent earnings growth despite returning most of its profits to shareholders.Moreover, Texas Instruments is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 67% over the next three years. Consequently, the higher expected payout ratio explains the decline in the company's expected ROE (to 44%) over the same period.ConclusionIn total, it does look like Texas Instruments has some positive aspects to its business. The company has grown its earnings moderately as previously discussed. Still, the high ROE could have been even more beneficial to investors had the company been reinvesting more of its profits. As highlighted earlier, the current reinvestment rate appears to be quite low. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future.

This change outpaced the S&amp;P 500's 0.47% loss on the day. At the same time, the Dow added 0.02%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 15.51%.Coming into today, shares of the chipmaker had lost 3.25% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector lost 1.25%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 2.53%.Texas Instruments will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.76, down 25.11% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $4.36 billion, down 11.07% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $7.53 per share and revenue of $18.11 billion, which would represent changes of -19.81% and -9.6%, respectively, from the prior year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Texas Instruments. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell).

9,c8302b0a-d2e4-3325-baae-12f48d6e545b,NUE,2023-03-02,Materials Sector is Showing Relative Strength: 3 Stocks to Buy,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/materials-sector-showing-relative-strength-202608392.html,1677702368,STORY,"['STLD', 'NUE', '^GSPC']","[After a strong start to the year, in February we began to see that strength falter. Last week in particular was challenging for the market and the S&amp;P 500 was down about -1%.All the major sector ETFs had a challenging performance over the last week as well. But one sector bucked the trend and outperformed, the Materials ETF XLB. Looking deeper into the components of XLB there were only a few stocks that were holding things up.The relative strength of the ETF brought to my attention the sector strength, and using the Zacks Rank for assistance I identified three highly ranked materials stocks that have a high likelihood of strong near-term performance.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNucorNucor NUE is a manufacturer and seller of steel and steel products. The company's Steel Mills segment produces hot-rolled, cold-rolled, and galvanized sheet steel products among a number of other products for the construction, automotive, and semiconductor industries. Over the years, the company has grown through acquisitions as well as by tapping new markets and expanding geographically.Nucor has shown itself to be a resilient stock over the last year, which has been extremely challenging for many stocks. Additionally, NUE has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over the last ten years, albeit with a great deal more volatility.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurthermore, from a technical perspective, the weekly candlestick chart of NUE shows a bullish pattern. Over the last five weeks NUE stock has built a clear bull flag. If price can break out of this consolidation on strong volume, it should launch the stock to new all-time highs. Alternatively, a break below the 160 level would invalidate the setup.TradingViewImage Source: TradingViewNucor currently boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), indicating an upward earnings revisions trend. Current quarter earnings have been revised higher by 12% over the last 30 days, and current year earnings a whopping 14% higher over the last 60.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFrom a valuation perspective NUE is interesting as well. Trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 13x, it is below its 10-year median of 15x, although it is already well off its recent low of 3x. Nucor also offers a dividend yield of 1.2%, which has grown 6% annually over the last 5 years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSteel DynamicsSteel producers have been one of the strongest industries in the market this year, and on top of its price performance, it currently ranks in the top 9% of the Zacks Industry Rank. Steel Dynamics STLD is among the leading steel producers in the U.S. It has steelmaking and coating capacity of around 16 million tons and is one of the most diversified steel companies in the country, with a broad range of specialty products.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSTLD stock has seen tremendous performance over the last year, dramatically outperforming the market indexes. Furthermore, the stock has been a great performer over the last decade with an annualized rate of return of 26%. That is nearly 1000% return over the last decade.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSteel Dynamics is also a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, indicating a positive earnings revision trend. Earnings have been revised significantly higher across all timeframes.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSTLD is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 11x, below its 10-year median of 12x. It should be noted that the stock has been bid aggressively over the last two years and is well off its low earnings multiple of 3x. Steel Dynamics also offers a dividend of 1.4%, which it has increased by 13% annually over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLindeLinde LIN is a U.K. based producer of industrial gases that are utilized in various industries like chemicals &amp; refining, food &amp; beverage, electronics, healthcare, manufacturing, and primary metals. The company also designs and constructs turnkey process plants for third-party customers, as well as for the gas businesses in various locations.LIN currently earns a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating a positive earnings revision trend. The current quarter sales estimates project a -2% decline to $8 billion, and the full year sales estimates are expected to grow 2% to $34 billion. Even with the draw in the current quarter sales estimates, earnings are expected to grow 5.5% YoY to $3.09 per share. Current year earnings estimates are also expected to grow 8% YoY to $13.39 per share.Estimates have been revised higher across all timeframes.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLIN has a valuation that is quite a bit richer than the others. At 26x one-year forward earnings LIN is well above the industry average of 17x, but still in line with its five-year median of 26x. Linde offers a dividend yield of 1.3%, which has been raised by an average of 10% each of the last 3 years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineAs the broader market begins to bump into resistance, looking for sectors with relative performance can help lead investors to winning stocks.

10,0855ee18-3b38-3112-af1d-e86975d496ab,NUE,2023-03-02,Nucor Corporation (NUE) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nucor-corporation-nue-attracting-investor-140002473.html,1677679202,STORY,['NUE'],"[Nucor (NUE) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this steel company have returned -0.9%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -2.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Steel - Producers industry, which Nucor falls in, has lost 1.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Nucor is expected to post earnings of $4.03 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -47.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +11.9%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $13.09 points to a change of -54.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.74 indicates a change of -10.3% from what Nucor is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +5.2%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Nucor.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NUE _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Nucor, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $8.6 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -18.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $32.04 billion and $29.04 billion estimates indicate -22.8% and -9.4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNucor reported revenues of $8.72 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -15.8%. EPS of $4.89 for the same period compares with $7.97 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.91 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +10.29%. The EPS surprise was +16.99%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nucor is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nucor. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

14,f13bc063-a072-306b-b3f2-6ba7befa37f0,UNM,2023-03-02,What Makes Unum (UNM) a Strong Momentum Stock: Buy Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/makes-unum-unm-strong-momentum-170005057.html,1677690005,STORY,['UNM'],"[Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Unum (UNM), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Unum currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?In order to see if UNM is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this insurance company holds up.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.For UNM, shares are up 4.27% over the past week while the Zacks Insurance - Accident and Health industry is down 2.6% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 6% compares favorably with the industry's 0.61% performance as well.Story continuesWhile any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Shares of Unum have increased 6.12% over the past quarter, and have gained 65.74% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved -2.35% and -7.83%, respectively.Investors should also take note of UNM's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, UNM is averaging 1,666,791 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with UNM.Over the past two months, 10 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost UNM's consensus estimate, increasing from $6.28 to $6.52 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 6 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 2 downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that UNM is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Unum on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The consensus estimate for 2024 earnings indicates an improvement of 4.8% from the year-ago reported figure on 3.3% higher revenuesThe expected long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 6.8%, outperforming the industry average of 5.9%. It estimates 45-55% growth in adjusted operating EPS by 2024.Unum, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), is the leading disability income writer and the second-largest writer of voluntary business in the United States. Solid operational performance, favorable benefits experience as well as solid top-line growth in the core businesses should continue to fuel growth and help UNM achieve its targeted growth. Management remains focused on moving on to a mix of businesses with higher growth and stable margins. This should help Unum Group’s premium from core business to increase 4-6% over the long term.Unum U.S. continues to benefit from disciplined sales trends, strong persistency in group lines and growth of new product lines like dental and vision, which improve premium income. On the other hand, favorable risk results should aid Colonial Life. Notably, Unum U.S. and Colonial Life are two of the largest operating segments of Unum.Insurers are direct beneficiaries of an improving interest rate environment. The Fed raised interest rates seven times in 2022 and once in 2023, with more on the horizon this year. At its December meeting, the Fed indicated taking the interest rate to 5.1% in 2023 to combat its expected 3.1% inflation. Thus, an improving interest rate environment should aid net investment income.Its sustained solid operating results have been fueling a solid level of statutory earnings and capital, cushioning financial flexibility.Banking on operational excellence, the insurer increased dividends at a nine-year CAGR (2014-2022) of 8%. The dividend yield is currently 3.3%, better than the industry average of 2.3%. UNM also has $200 million worth of share buyback authorization under its kitty for 2023.Story continuesAttractive ValuationUNM shares are trading at a discount than the industry average. Its price-to-book value of 0.96X is lower than the industry average of 1.6X.

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with both ""A"" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.One stock to keep an eye on is Unum Group (UNM). UNM is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 6.82 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 11.14. UNM's Forward P/E has been as high as 7.46 and as low as 5.45, with a median of 6.52, all within the past year.We also note that UNM holds a PEG ratio of 1. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. UNM's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 2.05. Within the past year, UNM's PEG has been as high as 1.01 and as low as 0.42, with a median of 0.53.Another notable valuation metric for UNM is its P/B ratio of 0.96. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This company's current P/B looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/B of 1.60. Over the past 12 months, UNM's P/B has been as high as 1.06 and as low as 0.47, with a median of 0.80.Story continuesValue investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. UNM has a P/S ratio of 0.73. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.92.Finally, investors should note that UNM has a P/CF ratio of 5.84. This metric focuses on a firm's operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook. UNM's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 7.22. Within the past 12 months, UNM's P/CF has been as high as 6.63 and as low as 4.67, with a median of 5.67.Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that Unum Group is likely undervalued currently. And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook, UNM sticks out at as one of the market's strongest value stocks.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

STT, Universal Insurance Holdings, Inc. UVE and Ralph Lauren Corp. RL.3 Stocks with Upgraded Broker Ratings to Maximize ReturnsAs 2023 started on a volatile note, investors are wary about entering the market. The inflation is turning out to be more “sticky” than expected. This has increased the chances that the Federal Reserve will continue raising the interest rates and then keep the rates high till inflation comes down reasonably.Higher rates will likely lead to a recession/economic slowdown in the latter part of 2023. This has resulted in bearish investor sentiments. Under such a scenario, it is difficult for individual investors to pick stocks independently and generate solid returns.One way to choose the right stocks in the current situation is to follow rating upgrades by brokers. In this regard, stocks like State Street Corp., Universal Insurance Holdings, Inc. and Ralph Lauren Corp. are worth a look.As brokers directly communicate with the top management, they have a deeper understanding of what is happening in a particular company. They precisely assess companies’ publicly available documents and even attend conference calls.Brokers have an extra understanding of the overall sector and industry. They place company fundamentals against the current economic backdrop to determine how a particular stock will fare as an investment.So, when brokers upgrade a stock, you can rely on their judgment. But solely depending on broker upgrades is not a good way to build your investment portfolio. Several other factors should be taken into consideration to ensure steady returns.Here are three of the five stocks that qualified for the screening:Boston, MA-based State Street is a financial holding company.

18,7718c06a-7b98-3a1b-81a0-8ec02a782d0f,STT,2023-03-02,5 Reasons to Add State Street (STT) Stock to Your Portfolio,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-reasons-add-state-street-150803264.html,1677683283,STORY,['STT'],"[It seems a wise idea to add State Street Corporation STT stock to your portfolio now. The company’s solid business servicing wins, strategic acquisitions, global reach and efforts to technologically upgrade operations are expected to support revenue growth. Its steady capital deployment activities will likely continue to enhance shareholder value.Further, analysts seem optimistic regarding the company’s earnings growth prospects. Over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for STT’s 2023 earnings has been revised 1.8% upward. Thus, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Over the past six months, shares of STT have gained 31%, outperforming the industry’s rally of 9.9%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Mentioned below are a few other factors that make State Street stock an impressive investment option now.Revenue Strength: While the company’s net interest revenues (NIR) have declined over the past couple of years because of near-zero interest rates, the same witnessed a three-year (ended 2022) compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.5%. In the current high interest rate regime, State Street is expected to continue witnessing an increase in NIR. For 2023, management expects NIR to increase 20%.Likewise, while the company’s total fee revenues declined in 2022, the same saw a four-year (2019-2022) CAGR of 1.6%. The rise was mainly driven by an increase in client activity and significant market volatility. State Street is well-positioned with respect to fundamental business activities, given its global exposure, and a broad array of innovative products and services (including the launch of State Street Digital and State Street Alpha). These efforts, along with business servicing wins and inorganic growth strategy, are expected to keep supporting the top line.The company’s projected sales growth rates of 3.9% for 2023 and 2.2% for 2024 ensure the continuation of the upward revenue trend.Earnings Per Share (EPS) Growth: State Street recorded earnings growth of 1.8% over the last three to five years. The upward momentum is likely to continue in the near term, as reflected by the company’s projected EPS growth rates of 16.2% for 2023 and 9% for 2024.Also, the company’s long-term (three to five years) estimated EPS growth rate of 8.9% promises rewards for investors.Impressive Capital Deployments: State Street’s capital deployment plan is impressive. Following the clearance of the 2022 stress test, in July, the company announced a 10% increase in quarterly dividend to 63 cents per share. It announced a new share repurchase program in January 2023, under which, it is authorized to buy back shares worth up to $4.5 billion. Also, State Street plans to return more than 80% of its earnings in 2023. Driven by a strong capital position and earnings strength, the company is expected to sustain improved capital deployments in the future and enhance shareholder value.Strong Leverage: State Street’s debt/equity ratio is 0.65 compared with the industry average of 0.90. This indicates that STT has a relatively lower debt burden compared with peers. Thus, the company will be more financially stable in adverse economic conditions.Favorable Valuation: The State Street stock seems undervalued right now when compared with the broader industry. The company’s PEG ratio of 1.16 is lower than the industry average of 1.44. Also, its price-cash flow (P/CF) ratio is 8.12, which is below the industry average of 8.75.Story continuesOther Stocks Worth a LookA couple of other top-ranked stocks from the finance space are The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation BK and Interactive Brokers Group, Inc.

These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.U.S. Bancorp in FocusBased in Minneapolis, U.S. Bancorp (USB) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of 9.45%. The company is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.48 per share, with a dividend yield of 4.02%. This compares to the Banks - Major Regional industry's yield of 3.21% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.64%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.92 is up 2.1% from last year. In the past five-year period, U.S. Bancorp has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 8.58%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. U.S. Bancorp's current payout ratio is 43%, meaning it paid out 43% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Earnings growth looks solid for USB for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $5.01 per share, with earnings expected to increase 12.58% from the year ago period.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Story continuesBig, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, USB is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more high growth non-tech stocks that are profitable, go directly to 5 High Growth Non-Tech Stocks That Are Profitable.High growth stocks can have various definitions. For this article, we define high growth as a company where analysts expect the company to grow its EPS by an average annual rate of at least 10% over the next 5 years.High growth stocks can oftentimes be riskier than blue chip stocks because much of their value is in the future and depends on future growth. If high growth stocks' growth rate slows more than expected, the market could value the perceived value in the future lower.Although many high growth stocks are tech stocks, there are also many high growth stocks in other sectors that aren't in technology.Companies try to grow their earnings in various ways. Some companies buy back a lot of their stock to try to generate more EPS growth if their earnings are relatively stable. Other companies try to acquire the right companies for growth. Yet other companies try to expand organically by developing new products or services or expanding into new markets.Sometimes those growth efforts work and sometimes they don't. When they do work, some companies that are successful in making new profitable products, buying back their stock at the right times, and buying the right companies can grow their earnings faster than 10% a year.The Economic CycleAn average company's growth rate can vary depending on where the economy is in the economic cycle. If the economy is strong and growing, the average EPS growth rate might be a little faster than if an economy is weak and potentially contracting.In terms of where the economy is currently in the economic cycle, it isn't clear where the economy is. Although unemployment is low and the economy is growing, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to continue to raise interest rates. If the central bank raises rates too much, there could be an economic slowdown.Story continuesIn 2022, the growth of many high growth stocks in the technology sector slowed fairly considerably in part due to the rise in interest rates. The valuation of many big tech companies decreased as a result of capital moving from the equity market into the U.S. Treasury market given the interest rate increases.Comparatively, many other non-tech sectors did a little better than the tech sector in 2022 because their valuations weren't as high or weren't as dependent on growth rates.If the future increases in interest rates cause a recession or a substantial economic slowdown, however, the valuations in non tech sectors could also come under pressure. An economic slowdown or recession could negatively affect earnings growth rates of companies in both technology and non technology sectors. It could also affect the future expected earnings growth rates for the next 5 years as well.As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.MethodologyFor our list of 16 High Growth Non-Tech Stocks That Are Profitable, we selected 16 stocks with competitive advantages in sectors other than technology that have an EPS next 5 year ratio of over 10% according to FINVIZ.com.EPS Next 5 Year Ratio is the estimated average annual EPS growth rate in the next 5 years.Given EPS Next 5 Year Ratio is an estimate, it can change from time to time depending on economic events, company specific events, and analyst view changes.We ranked the stocks based on their EPS next 5 year ratio according to FINVIZ.com.We also included trailing twelve month net income data from YCharts.Because we used net income data from YCharts, the net income data might not be adjusted and it could be over different time periods since different companies have different fiscal years.For those of you interested, check out 10 High Growth Low Dividend Stocks to Buy.16 High Growth Non-Tech Stocks That Are Profitable16.

You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here&gt;&gt;&gt;Here are the key points:For the 489 S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported Q4 results, total earnings are down -5.8% from the same period last year on +5.8% higher revenues, with 70.8% beating EPS estimates and 70.3% beating revenue estimates.Looking at 2022 Q4 as a whole, aggregate S&amp;P 500 earnings are currently expected to be down -5.6% on +5.8% higher revenues. Excluding the Energy sector’s strong contribution, Q4 earnings for the rest of the index would be down -9.5% on +4.9% higher revenues.For 2023 Q1, S&amp;P 500 earnings are currently expected to be down -9.0% on +2.0% higher revenues. This is down from -4% on January 6th and -2.9% in mid-December 2022.Earnings estimates for full-year 2023 have been coming down as well. From their peak in mid-April 2022, the aggregate total for the year has been cut by -12.4% for the index as a whole and -14.5% excluding the Energy sector’s contribution.The 2022 Q4 reporting cycle has effectively come to an end, with results from traditional retailers as the only remaining point of interest. With Walmart WMT, Target TGT, Home Depot HD and a number of other major retailers already out with their results, we have a good sense of how the Q4 earnings season unfolded even for the Retail space.The market liked the Walmart and Target reports, even though they provided weak(ish) guidance. The favorable reception for the results reflected appreciation for management execution in a tough operating environment. This is particularly so with Walmart, on the back of good inventory management and continued market share gains that partly drove the strong comparable sales growth during the holidays.Story continuesThe market likely sees the weak guidance from Walmart and Target as reflective of conservatism on management’s part. We don’t see anything wrong with this interpretation, particularly since we find ourselves in the so-called soft-landing camp. Simply put, Walmart’s guidance reflects a degree of moderation and weakness in the consumer that is somewhat at odds with a less-worrisome macroeconomic outcome.Regular readers know that we have a distinct stand-alone sector for the Retail sector, unlike the (official) Standard &amp; Poor’s GICS that houses retailers in the Consumer Discretionary and Consumer Staples sectors. We feel that our dedicated Retail sector classification allows us a more nuanced appreciation of evolving trends, but you will justifiably call our views on the subject as biased.The Zacks Retail sector is a fairly broad grouping that not only includes the likes of Walmart and Home Depot, but also digital players like Amazon AMZN and restaurant operators. All of these digital and restaurant players have already reported their Q4 results, with mostly the traditional players still to come at this stage.We have included a full scorecard of the Zacks Retail sector in the body of this report.The Earnings Big PictureFor the current period (2023 Q1), S&amp;P 500 earnings are currently expected to decline -9.0% from the same period last year on +2.0% higher revenues.As has been the case over the few quarters, estimates for 2023 Q1 have been steadily coming down.Please note that the magnitude of cuts to Q1 estimates is relatively lower compared to what we saw in the comparable periods for the last few quarters.As noted earlier, the current aggregate earnings total for the index approximates to an index ‘EPS’ of $215.75, up slightly vs. last week’s $215.65, but down big from $242.98 in mid-April, 2022.Expectations for the Coming PeriodsEarnings this year are now expected to be down -0.3%. This can hardly be called out-of-sync with a flat or even modestly down economic growth outlook. Don’t forget that headline GDP growth numbers are in real or inflation-adjusted terms while S&amp;P 500 earnings discussed here are not.As mentioned earlier, 2023 aggregate earnings estimates on an ex-Energy basis are already down by more than -14% since mid-April 2022. Perhaps we see a bit more downward adjustments to estimates over the coming weeks, after more companies report Q4 results and provide guidance along the lines of what we saw with Microsoft. But we have nevertheless already covered some ground in taking estimates to a fair or appropriate level.This is particularly so if whatever economic downturn lies ahead proves to be more of the garden variety rather than the last two such events. Recency bias forces us to use the last two economic downturns, which were also among the nastiest in recent history, as our reference points. But we need to be cautious against that natural tendency as the economy’s foundations at present remain unusually strong.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

26,10d3fe8e-6abe-3881-bab9-73676cf42906,WMT,2023-03-02,What to look for in Costco’s earning report amid slowing consumer demand,Quartz,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-costco-earning-report-amid-180500876.html,1677693900,STORY,"['COST', 'WMT']","[Costco is expected to report its weakest growth in three years on Thursday (March 2), following slumping sales in the retail sector, as rising living costs force consumers to be more selective about their spending habits.This would mark the seventh straight quarter in which Costco’s sales growth fails to keep up with past performance, a trend experienced by other retail giants like Target and Walmart. Executives at those companies have warned investors of continued uncertainty in coming months as well as weakened demand, as the consumer confidence index continued its slide in February.Read moreHere's how 10 industries are experimenting with ChatGPTMillennials are just as wealthy as their parentsWhat can you do when your company reverses on remote work?Costco’s membership growth remains strong, as the company is expected to add another 480,000 paid subscribers, but membership fees only account for 2% of the company’s overall revenue. During Costco’s last earnings call, chief financial officer Richard Galanti said an increase in the membership fee was “a question of when, not if,” but that the company was in no rush to do so, opting for a wait-and-see approach. The last time Costco membership fees rose was in 2017.Costco’s stock price is down 5% in the last year, but still beating the S&amp;P’s consumer discretionary sector, which posted a 19% loss. After the company beat its earnings forecast in December, its shares gained 1.5%.Even amid inflation and slowing sales, Costco’s CEO has repeatedly confirmed that the company will not raise the $1.50 price of the famous hot dog and soda combo. The meal has been the same price since 1985.Inflation and the retail marketContinued high inflation rates have made retail’s future difficult to predict. Despite increases in consumer spending and a robust job market, most retail companies are predicting weak growth in the next year. So, how are the country’s biggest retailers doing?Story continues🏹 Target: Target had a rough 2022, with profits falling a staggering 90% between the first and second fiscal quarters last year, mainly caused by record inflation affecting consumer demand. Despite Target beating earnings expectations in the last fiscal quarter, profits have continued their downward trend, with a 60% decline year-over-year.📦 Walmart: The retail giant issued a weaker-than-expected earnings forecast for 2023 last week, predicting that consumer spending would start the year strong but decline in coming months, producing sluggish growth for the company. The CFO said shoppers are holding back on big discretionary purchases as grocery prices remain high.🏠 Home Depot: The country’s largest home improvement company missed revenue expectations for the first time since 2019, blaming a decline in lumber costs, which are down 50% year-over-year. The company has remained relatively stable amid inflation, a housing market slowdown, and an overall downward trend in consumer spending.Charted: Costo share price 2022-2023datawrapper-chart-X47AoQuotable“The way to think about [higher food costs] is dry grocery and consumables are stubborn mid-double digit, and those are going to just be with us for a while. And it will get a little confusing because you’ll probably hear inflation numbers that start to sound lower, but you’ll have to remember that’s on a 2-year stack. So if inflation in dry grocery and consumables is only 3% or 5%, that’s on top of 15%. And that’s still a problem for the customer.” – Walmart CEO Doug McMilon, expressing long-term doubt about consumer purchasing power.Is petty theft actually affecting retail’s bottom line?Target’s CFO Michael Fiddelke recently made headlines by saying an increased rate of retail theft cost the company hundreds of millions of dollars in lost profit last year.“[Inventory shrinkage] was certainly a headwind [last year],” Fiddelke said. “We know we’re not alone in seeing elevated levels of shrink and organized retail crime driving some of that theft.”According to a study by the National Retail Foundation, there has been an uptick in stolen goods, with the report finding that companies lost roughly $94.5 billion to theft in 2021, up from $90.8 billion in 2020. The same survey found that roughly a third of retailers described organized retail crime as becoming more concerning in recent years.Companies like Target, Walgreens, and CVS have responded by adding increased security and locking up items that are easy to shoplift, like toothpaste and deodorant.However, Walgreen recently bucked the trend, with CFO James Kehoe saying that the company had invested too much in “largely ineffective” private security, adding that it plans to reduce some of its anti-theft measures.Related stories🪥 Walgreens realized theft isn’t as big an issue as litigation costs🇨🇳 Apple wants to move its manufacturing out of China🏬 Costco is proof that in-store shopping is far from overMore from QuartzWhat higher H-1B fees will mean for Indians hoping to work in the USMore than half of US nursing homes are unprofitable—and it's about to get a lot worseSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

The saving rate rose to 4.7% in January, the highest in a year, from 4.5% in December. ""Households are drawing down excess savings at a slower rate than before, likely due to recession concerns,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto, as quoted on Reuters.Personal income rose a strong 0.6%, majority of which originates from strong wage growth. Income at the disposal of households after adjusting for inflation jumped 1.4%, the largest uptick since March 2021. Disposable income was also improved by a 7.9% decline in tax payments.In January, Consumers purchases of long-lasting manufactured goods like motor vehicles, household furnishings and equipment, clothes as well as recreational goods and vehicles more. Spending on goods outlays recovered to 2.8% increment.Outlays on services was also solid as it rose 1.3%. Americans’ visits at restaurants and bars were quire frequent. Consumers spent on healthcare, recreation and transportation services too. All these numbers along with higher savings indicates that consumers will continue to shell out (though cautiously) in the coming months as well. Rising wages would also make this possible.U.S. retailer Walmart WMT announced plans to hike its average hourly pay to more than $17.50, making the range now $14 to $19 per hour. Home Depot’s HD Q4 earnings results revealed that the company announced an extra $1 billion investment in wage increases.

Even though the dividend went up, the yield is still quite low at only 1.6%. See our latest analysis for Raymond James Financial Raymond James Financial's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsEven a low dividend yield can be attractive if it is sustained for years on end. Raymond James Financial is quite easily earning enough to cover the dividend, however it is being let down by weak cash flows. In general, we consider cash flow to be more important than earnings, so we would be cautious about relying on the sustainability of this dividend.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 48.1%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 16% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendRaymond James Financial Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $0.347, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $1.68. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 17% per annum over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. It's encouraging to see that Raymond James Financial has been growing its earnings per share at 21% a year over the past five years. Earnings have been growing rapidly, and with a low payout ratio we think that the company could turn out to be a great dividend stock.In SummaryOverall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think Raymond James Financial will make a great income stock. While Raymond James Financial is earning enough to cover the payments, the cash flows are lacking. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock.Story continuesIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 3 warning signs for Raymond James Financial that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

""Leapgen will bring world-leading digital HR strategy capabilities and expertise to Mercer's Workforce and HR Transformation solutions, enabling better technology decision making, more effective mapping of HR solutions to an organization's unique needs, and improved workforce technology and employee experience outcomes,"" Martin said.The average organization deploys more than 16 HR systems, and Mercer’s latest research indicates that among US organizations increasing their total HR spend, 63% are spending more on HR tech in 2023. Despite increased investment, nearly 60% of HR Leaders do not think their HR function is sourced with the right mix of Human Capital Management (HCM) technology to effectively execute against business goals. Too often, HR technology can be perceived as a silver bullet; yet well-intended solutions miss the mark because organizations begin with the technology itself and implementation approach, versus deploying strategic capabilities that address the root challenges they are trying to solve. This reflects a broader need for strategic advice to help organizations develop a digital mindset and think holistically about HR and workforce experience.""When we don't view HR transformation through a digital lens, we risk low return on investment, low utilization, and, of increased importance, a fragmented and unsatisfactory workforce experience,"" Martin added. ""Mercer’s acquisition of Leapgen will enable our clients to approach HR technology strategically and holistically to transform how HR delivers value to the business, and how people experience work.""Story continuesWhile organizations have been leveraging HR technology for decades, COVID-related requirements – such as health reporting, talent intelligence needs, and support for employees in remote and hybrid work environments – has accelerated this adoption. ""Digital is the new mindset for technology, transformation, and workforce experience. It's the only way to design business and people capabilities for both scale and sustainability,"" said Jason Averbook, Global Leader, Digital HR Strategy, Mercer, and former CEO and Co-Founder, Leapgen.

Extending the industry’s family of PoE switches with the high industry-standard outdoor protection for these applications, Microchip Technology Inc. (Nasdaq: MCHP) today announces its PDS-204GCO switch that adds increased cyber protection plus the redundancy required for high network availability in mission-critical applications with long-distance connectivity.“Like our PDS-104GO switch, the PDS-204GCO complies with the high outdoor industry-standards, and is designed for easy and safe installation,” said Iris Shuker, director of Microchip's PoE business unit. “It also takes the next step to better support applications in which massive amounts of critical data are collected from widely dispersed PoE-powered edge IoT devices. It addresses these dual challenges of network security and network availability all the way from the endpoint to the central management system.”PoE technology enables power to be delivered over standard Ethernet infrastructure for quick and easy installation of edge IoT end points. Outdoor PoE switches connect these devices to the network and power them under a broad range of environmental conditions while monitoring and controlling status, including remote reset. Microchip’s PDS-104GO switch is the first to support the industry’s high Ingress Protection 67 (IP67) waterproof rating in these applications while eliminating the need to open the unit during installation and jeopardize safety, performance or reliability. The PDS-204GCO switch takes the next step, adding cybersecurity features for Ethernet networks to protect applications against threats at all network levels, and redundancy features that enable high network availability.Story continuesThe PDS-204GCO includes four PoE Gigabit Ethernet ports that support the IEEE 802.3bt (Type-4) standard and two Small Form-Factor Pluggable (SFP) fiber links that each support 1 Gigabit per second (Gbps) or 2.5 Gbps speeds. The fiber links can be used as optical uplink ports for surveillance cameras and as a redundant uplink path for increasing network availability. Support for ITU-T G.8032 Ethernet Ring Protection Switching (ERPS) technology ensures communication continues if there is an uplink link failure. The PDS-204GCO switches also supports multiple network topologies, and multiple units can be concatenated using a daisy-chain topology to extend the reach from the main central switches while reducing the number of optical cables directly connected to it from each device.The PDS-204GCO’s cybersecurity features protect both the data traffic transmitted within the switch and the switch’s system management. Key features for protecting transmitted data within the switch include endpoint device authentication and authorization, manual switch-traffic policy management, and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack prevention. Key features for protecting switch management and configuration include securing web browsing using self-signed or Certificate Authority (CA)-signed certifications and user authentication and authorization by remote servers using RADIUS or TACACS+ security mechanisms.The PDS-204GCO outdoor PoE switch is based on Microchip’s VSC7514 10-port industrial Ethernet switch, VCS6817 IStaX software package and PoE integrated circuits.Pricing and AvailabilityMicrochip’s PDS-204GCO switch is available for purchase at Microchip’s Purchasing and Client Services website here.

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum Occidental Petroleum Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Independent Director, Avedick Poladian, for US$1.1m worth of shares, at about US$57.23 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$59.71. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was only 24% of Avedick Poladian's holding.All up, insiders sold more shares in Occidental Petroleum than they bought, over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insider OwnershipI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Occidental Petroleum insiders own about US$116m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Occidental Petroleum Insiders?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Occidental Petroleum shares in the last quarter. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Occidental Petroleum insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Occidental Petroleum (of which 1 is a bit unpleasant!) you should know about.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

But environmental groups accuse banks of moving far too slowly in cutting support for fossil fuels if the world is to keep global temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.Citi's new targets include a pledge to cut the absolute emissions from lending to thermal coal mining by 90% from a 2021 baseline, while the intensity of emissions for auto manufacturing by 31% and for commercial real estate in North America by 41%.The bank's emissions for 2021 its energy portfolio dropped sharply versus a year earlier while it was broadly unchanged for power. But Citi cautioned that financed emissions can fluctuate from one year to the next and ""distort meaningful analyses of client decarbonization progress"", especially when climate-related reporting from clients remained inadequate.All of Citi's targets cover direct financing and exclude underwriting of stock and bonds. Citi said it planned to include such activities in its targets once an agreed methodology for all banks to use was published.The bank has previously announced restrictions on lending to some coal and oil and gas expansion projects but has not gone as far as some European lenders in tightening its policies.Val Smith, Citi's Chief Sustainability Officer, told Reuters that the bank's ""approach is a more thoughtful one to reaching net zero. We want to engage with clients in these sectors not divest."" (Reporting by Tommy Reggiori Wilkes; Editing by Hugh Lawson)]"

The objective is to reduce emissions and decarbonize Hapag-Lloyd’s fleet.The company’s new ultra-large dual-fuel container vessels can carry more than 23,500 twenty-foot equivalent units (“TEU”). Bunkering for these 12 new vessels is scheduled to commence in the latter half of the year, and the LNG will be delivered to the Port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands. These modern ships will be deployed on the Europe-Far East route and halt at major ports like Rotterdam, Hamburg, Singapore and Shanghai.This agreement forms an essential part of Hapag-Lloyd's commitment to decarbonize its fleet and achieve its 2045 net-zero carbon target. The use of LNG is expected to reduce the vessels’ CO2 intensity by up to 23% compared to conventional fuels. It also helps in almost complete reduction of particle emissions.Hapag-Lloyd and Shell have also agreed to work together toward finding more low-carbon fuel options, such as liquefied biomethane and hydrogen-based liquefied e-methane, to further reduce carbon emissions. Liquefied biomethane has the potential to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 65-100%.In connection with the agreement with Shell, Hapag-Lloyd's Senior Director of Global Fuel Purchasing, Jan Christensen, stated that the contract allows them to obtain flexible LNG supply at competitive prices. He has also expressed excitement about the potential collaboration with Shell on additional decarbonization solutions for significant change in the industry.Shell is working on different techniques to reduce carbon emissions in the shipping industry. It has already completed more than a thousand fuel transfer operations between ships and established 15 LNG fueling locations in 10 countries for their marine customers.Story continuesShell and Hapag-Lloyd have been working together for a long time. They have already made ""Brussels Express,"" the world's first large container ship, convert to gas propulsion. This recent announcement is another step in their ongoing collaboration.Shell, a multinational energy and petrochemical company headquartered in Netherlands, engages in the exploration, extraction, marketing, and transportation of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids, and  produces gas-to-liquids fuels and other products.Zacks Rank and Key PicksCurrently, Shell carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

With an emerging liquefied natural gas export industry, the expected completion of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, and billions of dollars in emissions reduction investments waiting to be unlocked, Canada is positioned to play a much larger role in providing responsibly produced energy resources to the world,” CAPP president and chief executive Lisa Baiton said.Canada’s oil and gas industry has been plagued by problems such as excessive red tape and the tightening government grip around emissions from oil and gas production. Yet demand for both oil and gas globally has helped it tackle these and, as suggested by the expected investment, will cause the industry to grow.Alberta, Canada’s top oil-producing province, recently announced plans to expand its reach into new markets by building what it calls economic corridors to the coasts of Canada and Alaska as a way of circumventing regulatory restrictions on new pipelines.Meanwhile, the country’s largest natural gas producer, Tourmaline Oil Corp., is sending its natural gas to the U.S. Gulf Coast, where it gets liquefied and sent to international markets. That’s because there are still zero LNG facilities in Canada and the only one that authorities have approved is currently under construction. The government, meanwhile, has signaled it does not share CAPP’s belief that Canada has a future as an LNG exporter.According to CAPP, the industry is also investing in emission reduction, not without a solid push from the federal government. Last year, Canadian oil and gas producers spent C$1.4 billion on research and development in that area and by 2025 the annual investment is seen rising to over C$2 billion.Story continuesBy Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Kazakhstan Could Suspend Natural Gas Exports Next WinterCan China Really Be An Unbiased Broker Of Peace?Gazprom Neft: Russian Oil Output Cut Will Help Balance The MarketRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

Energy-related emissions accounted for more than three-quarters of the production of greenhouse gasses.The 0.9 percent increase was less than the global economic growth rate of 3.2 percent in 2022, returning to a decade-long trend broken last year by the six percent jump due to the post-Covid rebound in global economic activity.Russia's sharp cutback in natural gas deliveries to Europe last year following international sanctions over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine triggered a global energy crisis.Not only did many European countries increase their use of coal-fired power plants, Asian countries did so even more as the price of liquefied natural gas skyrocketed.CO2 emissions from coal grew 1.6 percent, which was around one-quarter of the rate in 2021, the IEA said.Nevertheless, emissions growth still exceeded by far the average growth rate of coal emissions during the past decade, and more than offset the 1.6 percent drop in emissions from lower natural gas consumption.The IEA noted that CO2 emissions grew the fastest from oil, at 2.5 percent, but still remain below pre-pandemic levels. The increase was driven in large part to the post-Covid rebound in air traffic.Story continuesThe Paris-based IEA said China's emissions overall were flat last year due to strict Covid-19 measures and declining construction activity, which led to weaker economic growth and reductions in industrial and transport emissions.But excluding China, emissions from emerging and developing economies in Asia increased 4.2 percent due to their rapid economic growth and rising demand for energy.Birol also took a swipe at fossil fuel companies, which he noted were making record revenues thanks to the jump in energy prices.""We still see emissions growing from fossil fuels, hindering efforts to meet the world's climate targets,"" he said.Fossil fuel companies ""need to take their share of responsibility, in line with their public pledges to meet climate goals,"" Birol said, urging them to review their strategies in order to produce ""meaningful emissions reductions"".rl/js]"

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures settled at $78.16 a barrel, rising 47 cents, or 0.6%.Manufacturing activity in China grew last month at the fastest pace in more than a decade, data showed on Wednesday, adding to evidence of a rebound in the world's second-largest economy after removal of strict COVID-19 curbs.China's seaborne imports of Russian oil are set to hit a record high this month as refiners take advantage of cheap prices.Also helping prices were comments by Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic, who said the Fed should stick with ""steady"" quarter-point rate increases for now in an effort to avoid an economic downturn.""We're getting battered about by the Fed speak, but the Bostic comments seemed to help oil,"" said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York.The remarks eased concerns sparked earlier when strong U.S. unemployment data had investors worried about the possibility of faster and bigger interest rate increases.Growing expectations of rate increases by the European Central Bank (ECB) after a faster than expected acceleration in consumer prices in France, Spain and Germany, kept oil from moving higher.""Resurfacing inflation worries contributed to the souring mood,"" said PVM Oil analyst Tamas Varga. ""Persistent inflation anxiety will act as a break on a prolonged rally in the immediate future.""Euro zone inflation rose in February to a higher than expected annual rate of 8.5%, according to a first estimate from the EU's statistics agency.ECB minutes on Thursday suggested the central bank may keep raising interest rates beyond the March meeting in two weeks, ING Economics said.Story continuesIn the United States, a 10th consecutive week of crude stock builds also weighed on the market.Oil was also pressured by a strengthening dollar, after U.S. unemployment claims pointed to a strong jobs market.

The winners were selected by experts from the Alliance for Children's Mental Health, which brings together leaders from Morgan Stanley, its Foundation and prominent nonprofits in the children's mental health space.""This year's Innovation Award winners are advancing compelling programs with potential to effect powerful change across a range of communities and topics,"" said Ted Pick, Co-President at Morgan Stanley and Chair of the Alliance for Children's Mental Health Advisory Board. ""Whether through childhood education or athletics, we are excited to help these organizations grow and continue to address critical mental health issues facing young people today.""The winning nonprofits and their innovative mental health solutions include:Closegap is an EdTech nonprofit startup focused on providing real-time mental health support and early crisis intervention for students in K-12 public schools through a free online mental health check-in tool.K-12 Daily Mental Health Check-In: Captures relevant mental health information from students on a daily basis and delivers it to educators and school counselors using an interactive tool.The Confess Project trains barbers and stylists to become mental health advocates, with the mission to build awareness and break stigmas around mental health within the Black community.Black Youth Mental Health in the Shop: Provides trauma-informed mental health training to barbers and stylists specifically for working with Black youth, leads workshops to train parents as mental health advocates, and sponsors free youth haircut events to raise awareness about youth mental health.The Society for the Prevention of Teen Suicide is dedicated to increasing awareness, saving lives and reducing the stigma of suicide through specialized training programs and mental health resources that empower teens, parents, school staff and community members with the skills needed to help youth build a life of resiliency.Adolescent Clinical Suicide Prevention Training for Nurses: Empowers non-psychiatric nursing professionals to identify and assist adolescents at risk of suicide through specialized prevention training in partnership with hospital systems.Strategies for Youth aims to keep vulnerable young people out of the juvenile justice system and to provide them with the knowledge, support and resources they need to succeed.Trauma Jeopardy and From Stress to Success - LGBTQ+ Youth Experiences: Offer psycho-social educational game-based interventions that help young people-particularly at-risk LGBTQ+ youth-effectively and safely recognize and manage trauma and distress.Up2Us Sports is the country's only national sports-based service program that trains coaches to address mental health and other challenges facing youth in underserved communities.Sports-Based Youth Development (SBYD) Coach is a series of innovative and highly interactive videos accessed online and via a coaching app, which will provide coaches with techniques and best practices for fostering social and emotional learning skills as well as mental wellness among youth.Story continues""Funding solutions that address children's mental health-specifically among diverse and underserved communities-is mission-critical.

Promises to hit 30% operating margins by early 2024, up from mid- to high-20s currently.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Motley Fool's 5 High Growth Stock Picks. According to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. strategists, the significant outperformance of cheaper, value stocks over growth stocks from the previous year is expected to reverse soon as the pace of economic recovery slows down. The value trade, which was a popular investment strategy in 2022, is beginning to lose its appeal. As a result, JPMorgan’s team led by Mislav Matejka suggested that investors may need to consider reducing their exposure to value stocks compared to growth stocks in the next one or two months. They recommend going ""outright underweight value versus growth,"" as stated in a note. Mislav Matejka further wrote in a note: “Our core view is that in the second half, market will be moving back to the recession trade, but even if the opposite scenario gains traction, value might not be the best place to be.”After significantly outperforming growth stocks last year by the largest margin since the dotcom bubble in 2000, the performance of value stocks has begun to slow down in comparison. Although value stocks received a boost from rising bond yields and inflation, investors are becoming more cautious due to concerns about a potential hawkish policy. This may lead to a decrease in support for the value trade as bond yields reach their peak. The current pace of economic activity is likely to reach its peak and could start to decline soon. Additionally, the stall in inflation expectations implies that the value factor may not perform as well relative to growth in the future.Motley Fool Asset Management prioritizes investing in high-quality companies with strong growth potential. The company regularly evaluates its current portfolio holdings and adjusts them based on prevailing stock market trends, with the aim of optimizing gains and minimizing losses. Some of the top high growth stock picks of Motley Fool include Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Atlassian Corporation (NASDAQ:TEAM), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).

The list is ranked according to the revenue growth rate, from lowest to highest. We have also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around the securities as of Q4 2022, which was assessed from Insider Monkey’s database of holdings of 943 elite funds. Motley Fool's High Growth Stock PicksMotley Fool's High Growth Stock Picks10. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA)3-year Revenue Growth: 45.3%Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is an American multinational financial technology firm. Securities filings for the fourth quarter of 2022 reveal that Motley Fool Asset Management owned 96,997 shares of Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) worth $33.7 million, representing 3.80% of the total 13F portfolio. On February 14, Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) declared a $0.57 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on May 9, to shareholders of record on April 7. Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev on January 30 raised the firm's price target on Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) to $405 from $380 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares following the ""solid"" Q4 results.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 139 hedge funds were long Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), compared to 146 funds in the prior quarter. Charles Akre’s Akre Capital Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 5.86 million shares worth $2 billion. Like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Atlassian Corporation (NASDAQ:TEAM), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is one of the top high growth stock picks of Motley Fool. Baron FinTech Fund made the following comment about Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Shares of global payment network Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) increased after reporting strong quarterly results, with 15% revenue growth and 13% EPS growth despite significant headwinds from currency movements and the suspension of operations in Russia. Payment volume grew 21% in local currency (excluding Russia) as consumer spending remained resilient and the international travel recovery continued as border restrictions were lifted. We continue to own the stock due to Mastercard’s long runway for growth and significant competitive advantages.”9. Paylocity Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:PCTY)3-year Revenue Growth: 51.8%Paylocity Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:PCTY) provides cloud-based human capital management and payroll software solutions in the United States. In Q4 2022, Motley Fool reported owning 48,442 shares of Paylocity Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:PCTY) worth $9.4 million. It is one of the firm’s top high growth stock picks. On February 2, Paylocity Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:PCTY) reported a Q2 non-GAAP EPS of $1.12, beating market estimates by $0.38. Revenue for the period increased 39.3% year-over-year to $273 million, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $13.32 million. Bryan Bergin, an analyst at Cowen, increased the price target for Paylocity Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:PCTY) on February 3 from $231 to $265 and maintained an Outperform rating on the shares. According to the analyst, Paylocity Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:PCTY)’s momentum continued in the second quarter, with the company surpassing its guidance by a significant margin and providing strong guidance for 2023, which includes impressive profitability despite investments in growth.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 33 hedge funds were long Paylocity Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:PCTY), compared to 32 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is the largest stakeholder of the company. ClearBridge Mid Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Paylocity Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:PCTY) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Paylocity Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:PCTY) also held up well against broad customer spending slowdowns earlier in the year but saw its share price weaken on broader macro headwinds during the quarter. The company’s cloud-based human capital management and payroll software solutions help businesses manage through broad labor shortages and provide solutions to retain talent. However, as excess slack in the labor market has begun to be absorbed, investments in human resources solutions have declined. Additionally, we believe Paylocity continues to have a compelling long-term growth runway as it attracts new customers and gains market share against large, mature competitors.”8. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)3-year Revenue Growth: 54.9%Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is a California-based customer relationship management technology firm. It is one of Motley Fool’s top high growth stock picks. The hedge fund raised its stake in Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) by 209% in the fourth quarter of 2022, holding 70,533 shares worth $9.35 million. As of March 1, Wall Street analysts expect Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) to report a profit, excluding one-time items, of $1.36 per share, on revenue of $7.99 billion. During the prior-year quarter, the company earned 84 cents a share, on $7.33 billion in revenue.On February 24, BMO Capital analyst Keith Bachman raised the firm's price target on Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) to $185 from $172 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares ahead of its earnings. According to the analyst's research note, continued strong margins may be a significant factor in driving the stock higher as growth stabilizes at a high-single-digit rate. Additionally, the firm believes that Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)’s large size gives it an advantage over other SaaS vendors in terms of brand recognition, sales, and cost management.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 117 hedge funds were bullish on Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), and Harris Associates held the largest stake in the company, with 8.14 million shares worth $1 billion. Aristotle Atlantic made the following comment about Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We sold Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) to reduce our weighting in the Information Technology sector. Salesforce held their investor day, and the company reiterated their organic Fiscal Year 2026 revenue target of $50 billion. This target remains more back-end loaded based on current slowing macroeconomic conditions and requires new annual contract growth well ahead of what the company has been averaging for the past few years. We are skeptical that the company will be able to achieve this revenue target organically and see Merger &amp; Acquisitions (M&amp;A) being key to achieving the growth. While we believe Salesforce has shown good success in growing its non-CRM clouds, we do see more competitive pressures emerging for the Marketing and Customer Service Clouds, specifically on the pricing side during a global economic slowdown.”7. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)3-year Revenue Growth: 55.0%Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the top high growth stocks in Motley Fool Asset Management’s Q4 portfolio. The hedge fund owns 448,001 shares of the tech giant, worth nearly $40 million and representing 4.48% of the total 13F securities. The average 3-year revenue growth for Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) between 2020 and 2022 came in at 55%. On February 9, Wells Fargo analyst Brian Fitzgerald noted that the Bard rollout has been disappointing. However, there is an opportunity for investment in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) due to the excitement around Generation Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI), which has potential for deployment without disrupting search monetization. Additionally, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a leader in conversational AI technology and there is a misunderstanding of what drives search share. As a result, the firm recommends purchasing Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares, assigning the stock an Overweight rating and a target price of $150.According to Insider Monkey’s Q4 data, 152 hedge funds were bullish on Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), compared to 156 funds in the prior quarter. Chris Hohn’s TCI Fund Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 54.5 million shares worth $4.8 billion. Diamond Hill Large Cap Strategy made the following comment about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Other bottom contributors included media and technology giant Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), apparel and footwear company V.F. Corporation and utility operator Dominion Energy. We believe Alphabet’s shares underperformed on concerns of a weakening macroeconomic environment. The company also reported weaker-than-expected earnings and revenue for Q3 2022. Longer-term, we expect Alphabet’s search engine advertising, YouTube advertising and other initiatives to continue driving revenue growth. As such, we used the share price weakness this quarter to add to our position.”6. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)3-year Revenue Growth: 61.7%NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a California-based provider of graphics, semiconductors, and networking solutions in the United States, Taiwan, China, and internationally. In the fourth quarter of 2022, Motley Fool held 54,758 shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) worth $8 million, representing 0.9% of the total securities. It is one of the premier high growth stock picks of the hedge fund. During Nvidia's fourth-quarter earnings report, CEO Jensen Huang openly expressed his belief in the significant role that artificial intelligence will play in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s future. Huang stated that the AI market has reached a turning point and that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is currently the main operating system for AI systems.On February 23, C.J. Muse, an analyst at Evercore ISI, increased the price target on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) from $245 to $300 while maintaining an Outperform rating on the shares. This decision comes after NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) beat expectations for the January quarter and provided an even more positive outlook for the April quarter. The firm expects data center revenues to accelerate throughout the entirety of 2023, which should be positively received given concerns about decelerating data center demand and the potential for a total revenue guide down for April, the analyst wrote in a research note. According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 106 hedge funds were long NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), compared to 89 funds in the earlier quarter. Like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Atlassian Corporation (NASDAQ:TEAM), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Motley Fool’s high growth stock picks include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). O’keefe Stevens Advisory made the following comment about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“The market and our portfolios had a challenging year as interest rates rose, and deteriorating fundamentals cut our largest position, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), in half. Since our initial purchase in 2013, NVDA has seen its stock decline 50% one other time, back in 2018. The best-performing businesses and stocks do not go up and to the right. Mr. Market gets moody, and even one of the highest quality companies in the world is not immune. Drawdowns of this magnitude are challenging to stomach, even though the stock is up 50x in less than ten years. While we consider ourselves old school value investors, we continue to hold this fantastic company even though, optically, it does not appear cheap. Our confidence in Jensen remains, and while gaming is no longer in hyper-growth mode, the Data Center segment continues to grow. AI, Automotive, and other small but rapidly growing industries are the next leg of the story. Chris Mayer discusses the position in greater detail with commentary from our CIO, Peter O’Keefe.

Core market growth and Diversify, Decarbonize and Digitize (3D) strategy are driving the company’s bookings. Also, its realignment activities are helping it capture more margin enhancement opportunities with efficient cost management and higher productivity. For 2023, the company expects bookings of $2.7 billion driven by supportive end markets. Revenues are anticipated to increase in the range of 9-11% from the prior-year reported figure.In February 2023, Flowserve inked a deal to acquire Velan Inc. in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $245 million. The buyout will strengthen FLS’ valves portfolio and build upon its existing assets through the addition of Velan’s premier brands, strong heritage and technical expertise in diverse end markets. Velan will become part of Flowserve’s Flow Control Division (FCD) segment. The deal is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2023.Flowserve utilizes its cash flow to reward its shareholders by distributing dividends. The company paid out dividends worth $104.5 million to its shareholders in 2022.However, FLS has been witnessing supply-chain challenges and logistics problems. Flowserve’s cost of sales increased 5.1% and selling, general and administrative expenses rose 2.3%, year over year in 2022. A potential recessionary environment is expected to weaken its GDP-driven markets, including chemicals and general industries.Foreign exchange is an added headwind for FLS, given its widespread presence in the international markets.

STT, Universal Insurance Holdings, Inc. UVE and Ralph Lauren Corp. RL.3 Stocks with Upgraded Broker Ratings to Maximize ReturnsAs 2023 started on a volatile note, investors are wary about entering the market. The inflation is turning out to be more “sticky” than expected. This has increased the chances that the Federal Reserve will continue raising the interest rates and then keep the rates high till inflation comes down reasonably.Higher rates will likely lead to a recession/economic slowdown in the latter part of 2023. This has resulted in bearish investor sentiments. Under such a scenario, it is difficult for individual investors to pick stocks independently and generate solid returns.One way to choose the right stocks in the current situation is to follow rating upgrades by brokers. In this regard, stocks like State Street Corp., Universal Insurance Holdings, Inc. and Ralph Lauren Corp. are worth a look.As brokers directly communicate with the top management, they have a deeper understanding of what is happening in a particular company. They precisely assess companies’ publicly available documents and even attend conference calls.Brokers have an extra understanding of the overall sector and industry. They place company fundamentals against the current economic backdrop to determine how a particular stock will fare as an investment.So, when brokers upgrade a stock, you can rely on their judgment. But solely depending on broker upgrades is not a good way to build your investment portfolio. Several other factors should be taken into consideration to ensure steady returns.Here are three of the five stocks that qualified for the screening:Boston, MA-based State Street is a financial holding company. STT provides a range of products and services for institutional investors worldwide through its subsidiaries.Story continuesThe company’s earnings for 2023 are expected to increase 16.2%.

Colgate recently introduced new premium whitening toothpastes in China targeting affluent city dwellers.""The second half of the year will be far better,"" said Yves Briantais, a marketing executive for Colgate's Asia-Pacific region.Procter &amp; Gamble Co, whose second-largest market is China, is carefully watching its high-end SK-II skincare line as China reopens, said finance chief Andre Schulten at the conference.Beiersdorf's Warnery said growth in its premium La Prairie and cheaper Eucerin and Nivea skincare ranges was likely to be driven by Chinese demand. Tourism from China was helping sales in neighbouring Macau, Hong Kong, Taiwan and even Japan, he added.Story continuesReckitt Benckiser, which makes Nurofen tablets, cold remedy Lemsip and Durex, saw a pick-up in China after a decline in volumes because of lockdowns.""I have no doubt that the intimate wellness (business) in China is going to perform well,"" said interim CEO Nicandro Durante, referring to the division which includes KY Jelly and Durex condoms.The upbeat comments echo those of other executives during earnings season, particularly from luxury labels which are banking on a strong rebound fuelled by Chinese shoppers drawing on savings built up during pandemic lockdowns.Upmarket U.S. companies including Coach handbag maker Tapestry Inc and Ralph Lauren Corp last month recently said demand had started picking up in China.""We certainly have seen a meaningful trend change in Greater China,"" Tapestry Chief Financial Officer Scott Roe said last month, while Ralph Lauren executives said they were seeing traffic at its brick-and-mortar stores surge.""We expect China to come back resiliently in the quarter,"" Ralph Lauren's operating chief Jane Nielsen said.Resilient sales in China would be a relief for companies struggling with higher energy and wage costs, particularly in Europe, at the same time as rising prices of food, energy and rents are forcing consumers to be pickier about what they buy.Stronger signs that Chinese factories are rebounding after COVID restrictions were lifted late last year could also temper an expected downturn in the global economy, as the U.S. Federal Reserve stays on its higher-for-longer interest rate path.U.S. retailer Walmart Inc, which operates nearly 400 retail and wholesale stores in China, reported strong traffic in its stores since reopening.""We have seen people returning more to stores, which is what you would expect, and also wanting to celebrate events,"" Judith McKenna, CEO of Walmart International, said on a call last week.GROWING CONFIDENCERetailer shares rose across global equity markets on Wednesday, even as broader indexes gave back gains on more concerns about inflation.Reckitt shares rose 1.5% in London, while shares in Moncler rose 3.3% after the Italian luxury group, known for its warm puffer jackets, reported a strong start to the year.Chief marketing and operating officer Roberto Eggs told a call with analysts on Tuesday evening the company saw double-digit sales growth in China before and after the Lunar New Year holiday in January.""We always look at the results two weeks before and one week after the Chinese New Year and the impact is really positive,"" he said.Adding to growing confidence in the luxury sector, the company said it had seen no adverse effects on demand from a 10% price increase at the start of the winter season.Reuters reported in February LVMH's top fashion brand Louis Vuitton was expected to increase prices in China by as much as 20%.(Reporting by Christoph Steitz in Frankfurt and Jan Schwartz in Hamburg, Elisa Anzolin in Milan, Richa Naidu in London and Siddharth Cavale and Jessica DiNapoli in New York and Aishwarya Venugopal in Bengaluru; Writing by Josephine Mason in London; Editing by Catherine Evans and Richard Chang)]"

Despite the significant increase in inventory over last year's record lows, home prices are still growing, albeit at a slower pace of 7.8% over last February, a sign of still-high hopes from home sellers entering the market.What it means for homebuyers, sellers, and the housing marketIn a market with conditions that don't particularly favor buyers or sellers, both will likely have to make compromises to make a deal happen. As mortgage rates continue to fluctuate and increase the cost of buying a home, it's important for sellers to price their home appropriately to attract buyers in the market. For buyers, it's critical they make the best offer they can on a home that fits their needs and budget. Realtor.com®'s mortgage calculator can help home shoppers estimate monthly payments quickly and easily as rates change from week to week.""The number of homes for sale on the market is up significantly from a year ago, even though fewer homeowners have listed their home for sale in recent months. High home prices and mortgage rates continue to cut into buyer interest and homes are taking more than three weeks longer to sell than last year,"" said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist for Realtor.com®. ""With a smaller pool of buyers today and more competition from other homes on the market, homesellers will likely need to adjust their price expectations in the market this spring.""""For many, shopping for a new home often begins or picks up as we head into the warmer months, which is right around the corner,"" said Clare Trapasso, executive news editor at Realtor.com®. ""Potential buyers looking to take advantage of more homes to choose from and a less competitive pace also have more negotiating power than they did a year ago. So if a home has been on the market a while without receiving any offers, they may want the seller to contribute to their closing costs, make expensive repairs, or even buy down their mortgage rate.""Story continuesFebruary 2023 Housing Metrics – NationalMetricChange over Feb. 2022Change over Feb. 2019Median listing price7.8% (to $415,000)+40.1 %Active listings67.8 %-47.5 %New listings-15.9 %-23.9 %Median days on market+23 days (to 67 days)-17 daysShare of active listings with price reductions+7.6 percentage points (to 13.3%)-2.7 percentage points More options despite fewer sellers entering the marketThe supply of homes for sale continued to rise in February at a record annual pace, driven mostly by low interest from buyers facing high home and mortgage costs rather than an influx of new homes for sale to the market. Despite a significant increase in the number of homes for sale in recent months as existing home sales and demand slow, there are still fewer homes available to buy nationwide on a typical day than there were a few years ago.In February, the U.S. supply of active listings for sale rose at a record annual pace for the sixth month in a row, up 67.8% compared to last year, but it is still well below pre-pandemic levels (-47.4% compared to the February 2017-2019 average). Both newly-listed homes (-15.9%) and pending listings, or homes under contract with a buyer (-24.7%), declined year-over-year.Across the 50 largest metros, the number of homes for sale was up 86.0% compared to last February, with the most growth in active listings in the South (+141.4%).Among the 50 largest U.S. metros, 49 markets saw active inventory gains in February compared to last year, but only Las Vegas, Austin, Texas, and San Antonio saw higher levels of inventory compared to typical February 2017–2019 levels. Hartford, Conn. (-8.8%) was the only metro to see inventory decline on a year-over-year basis.Six metros saw the number of newly listed homes increase over last year, led by Raleigh, N.C. (+14.8%), Dallas (+10.3%) and San Antonio (+10.2%). The largest yearly decline in newly listed homes were in western metros, including San Jose, Calif. (-43.3%), San Francisco (-39.4%), and Seattle (-36.8%).Home price growth continues to level off as more sellers drop their asking priceWhile home prices were up in February compared to last year, year-over-year asking price growth has remained in the single digits for three months in a row, suggesting that home prices are continuing to moderate and cool down from last year's record highs. While mortgage rates are down from their November highs, rates rebounded this month and with higher home prices compared to last February, the typical monthly mortgage payment is roughly $630 more than it was a year ago. As a result of these cost pressures, the slowdown in the demand for homes means more than twice as many sellers cut their asking price in February compared to last year.The U.S. median listing price was $415,000 in February, up from $406,000 in January, and 7.8% higher than a year ago.Among the 50 largest U.S. metros, the biggest annual listing price gains were in Midwest metros (+11.9%, on average). The metros with the biggest asking price increases were Milwaukee (+48.8%), Memphis (+42.7%), and Virginia Beach (+16.3%); however, in these metros the mix of inventory also changed and more larger, expensive homes are for sale today.In February, 13.0% of active listings had their price reduced, up from 5.4% a year ago. Southern metros (+10.3 percentage points) saw the largest increase in the share of listings with price reductions.Listing prices declined in eight markets, led by Austin (-8.0% year-over-year), New Orleans (-7.0%), and Pittsburgh (-6.9%). In those markets, the median price-per-square-foot also declined on a yearly basis, signaling that price declines weren't from a rise in smaller homes for sale but by sellers adjusting their expectations and sales price.Homes take three weeks longer to sell than last yearThe housing market has cooled considerably since the height of the pandemic, when buyer demand outmatched the record low supply of homes for sale and bidding wars were common. In February, homes took more than three weeks longer to sell than they did at this time last year, despite an uptick in buyer sentiment in January. The continued slower pace of home sales signals a return to a more balanced housing market and what was considered normal before the pandemic, and it gives buyers more time to decide if a house is right for them.The typical home spent 67 days on market in February, 23 days longer than this time last year, but still 20 days faster than in February 2017-2019, on average.Relative to the national pace, time on market was lower across the 50 largest U.S. metros in February (56 days, on average) and was 19 days slower than the February 2022 pace.Compared to last year, 47 out of 50 metros saw an increase in time on market with larger metros in the West seeing the greatest increase (+26 days). Austin, Texas (+52 days), Raleigh, N.C. (+51 days), and Las Vegas and Denver (+38 days) saw the greatest increases in time on market.Only one market saw shrinking time on market and two were unchanged from last year: Hartford, Conn. (-2 days), Cincinnati, Ohio (+0 days), and Buffalo, N.Y.

To skip our detailed analysis of current stock market dynamics, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Short-Term Stocks To Buy Now.When you're looking for stocks to invest in for the short-term, typically, it is better to buy stocks that have been showing an upward price trend and sell the ones that have had poor returns. This strategy is known as momentum investing. It works on the basis of the rationale that once a trend is established, it is likely to continue. So once a stock has begun performing either really well or poorly, it's likely to continue performing that way in the near future. The main trick behind momentum investing, however, is that once even the well-performing stocks have reached what seems to be their peak, a momentum investor would sell those shares too. Because of this practice, the Wall Street adage ""buy low, sell high"" has become a famous saying familiar to all momentum traders.While momentum trading, if practiced safely, can yield attractive results, it is a strategy that must be implemented carefully. In times of market volatility, this form of investing is particularly vulnerable. For instance, by October 2022, the market saw the S&amp;P 500 decline by 23.2% year-to-date, while other indexes did not fare much better. However, 2023 seems to be a better year for momentum trading as the market has seen a rally already in January. S&amp;P 500 ETFs returned 6.3% in January. These ETFs lost 2.5% in February, reducing their year-to-date returns to 3.6%. Considering the above, stocks like salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM), Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) are posting strong gains in 2023. These are some of the companies momentum investors should look at seeing as analysts predict upside potential for all of them, and they are already embarking on an upward price trend. We have added these companies to our list of the best short-term stocks to buy now, considering how momentum stocks seem perfect investments for traders looking for short-term positions. Story continues15 Best Short-term stocks to buyPhoto by Tech Daily on UnsplashLet's now take a look at the 15 best short-term stocks to buy now.Our MethodologyFor our list below, we have selected price momentum stocks that have posted year-to-date gains above 20% and one-year declines also above 20%. We have also mentioned the upside potential of these stocks.  These figures are updated as of February 28. To ensure we have selected the best stocks, we have used Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the fourth quarter to pick momentum stocks that were popular among the 943 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in that quarter.

(NASDAQ:ALGN), holding 935,246 shares. In total, 34 hedge funds were long the stock, with a total stake value of $834 million.Polen Capital, an investment management firm, mentioned Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) in its second-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“Align Technology shares declined significantly during the second quarter when management reported a meaningful deceleration in growth. Management cited a host of challenges, including COVID19 impacts, especially in China with restrictions and lockdowns under their zero-COVID policy, a weaker economic environment, inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions, and the war in Ukraine, to name a few. Tough comparisons were also a reality— Invisalign case starts in 1Q22 were roughly flat, having lapped the 66% growth from the prior year. It’s not completely surprising that growth is slowing on such tough comparisons, but the company’s shares declined on the news.By looking at Align’s three-year compound average growth rate (CAGR) to smooth out the ups and downs through COVID, key metrics like Invisalign case shipment, clear aligner revenue, and earnings per share have all grown ~20% during the trailing three years. We think this is quite respectable given the challenges during this period, but the lack of near-term momentum or visibility has not been well received in the current environment. According to our research, Align is the clear market leader, has global scale, a superior product, and still very modest market penetration. While growth may be challenged near term, we remain confident in the long-term growth opportunity.”9. Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40One-year Return as of February 28: -47.57%Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) is a cloud services provider. The company is based in San Francisco, California.An Overweight rating was reiterated on Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) shares by Andrew Nowinski at Wells Fargo on February 13. The analyst also raised his price target on the stock from $55 to $75.Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) has held an attractive and consistent gross margin since 2021. In the fourth quarter of 2021, its gross margin was 79%, and in the same quarter in 2022, it had fallen only 2 points to 77%. The company has also strongly retained its net revenue. In the fourth quarter, its net revenue retention rate was 122%. Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) shares have gained 39.49% year-to-date despite their one-year decline, showing how the stock is incredibly volatile. Yet analysts still see a 9.67% upside to the shares.There were 40 hedge funds long Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) in the fourth quarter. Their total stake value was $635 million.Baron Funds, an investment management company, mentioned Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“We continued to build our position in Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) during the quarter as the shares declined with the overall software space and the long-term risk/ reward balance became more compelling. The company reported a strong second quarter, with revenue growth accelerating to 54%, as well as better gross and operating margins. Third quarter guidance was also ahead of Wall Street expectations. Given Cloudflare’s proprietary network and massive global scale, its software products have a disruptive price-performance advantage over competitors. As the company introduces new products as well as disruptive packaging/pricing, its unit level economics should continue to improve over time, with the company already well ahead of its long-term gross margin target of 74%, reporting 78.9% for the second quarter. This drives strong cross/upselling activity with customers, reflected in strong net-dollar expansion rates in excess of 125%. Indeed, in the most recent quarters, customers purchasing five or more products reached 81% of the base, six or more products reached 70% of the base, and seven or more products reached 58% of the base. Enterprise penetration continues to be a key long-term driver, with 1,749 customers now spending over $100,000 annually with the company, growing 61% and now accounting for over 60% of total revenue. With approximately 152,000 paying customers at the end of last quarter, large enterprise customers still represent just 1% of total paid customers and thus a material growth opportunity in the coming years. We continue to have high confidence in the company’s ability to innovate at a rapid pace (announced 20 new products or enhancements in September alone), package and bundle with disruptive pricing, and take material share in its large and growing addressable markets.”8.

(NYSE:SPOT) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE:SPOT) is a leading global digital music service offering on-demand audio streaming through paid premium subscriptions and an ad-supported model. Shares of Spotify were down on weakness in the company’s fourth quarter gross margin guide. We still view Spotify as a long-term winner in music streaming with potential to reach more than one billion active monthly users. Subscriber additions remain strong, price increases seem likely, and cost discipline has become a bigger focus.”7. Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51One-year Return as of February 28: -29.4%Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) is an asset management and custody banks company. It is based in New York.You Fan, an analyst at CICC, initiated coverage of Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) shares on January 12 with an Outperform rating and a $100 price target.The company is considered well-diversified, managing multiple revenue streams and about $1 trillion in assets under management. Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) shares gained about 19.27% year-to-date despite their one-year decline, showing the stock price’s volatility. Analysts forecast an upside potential of 13.36% on the shares, and consider it an incredibly appealing stock because of its 4.85% dividend yield offering significant passive income.Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) was found among the 13F holdings of 51 hedge funds in the fourth quarter. Their total stake value was $1.1 billion.Baron Funds, an investment management company, mentioned Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) was a detractor in the fourth quarter as shares sold off sharply in December after the company announced that it received redemption requests above monthly and quarterly caps in its non-traded REIT fund (BREIT) and would be limiting investor withdrawals. BREIT was one of Blackstone’s fastest-growing flagship retail fund vehicles and hence received outsized investor attention and media coverage. While redemptions themselves aren’t surprising given the stark performance dispersion between BREIT and publicly listed real estate, investors grew concerned that the decision to limit withdrawals would create a cascading effect, eventually force BREIT to liquidate assets and perhaps impair the growth of additional retail fund vehicles. Subsequently, Blackstone increased liquidity through the sale of a JV interest in Las Vegas casino assets at attractive prices and received a $4 billion investment from the University of California. While acknowledging the step back and near-term headwinds, we believe BREIT has plenty of runway to meet redemptions without being forced to liquidate assetsWe recently reduced the size of the Fund’s investment in Blackstone Inc. because of our expectation of a slowdown in its growth outlook. We remain bullish, however, about the company’s long-term prospects. Blackstone is the world’s largest alternative asset manager with $1 trillion in assets under management and the largest real estate manager in the world. Blackstone has a premier brand, a global franchise, loyal customers, an exceptional balance sheet, and an excellent management team.Following a 36% correction in its shares in 2022, we believe Blackstone’s valuation has become more compelling and may look for opportunities to acquire additional shares in the future.”6. HubSpot, Inc. (NYSE:HUBS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 53One-year Return as of February 28: -25.38%HubSpot, Inc.

(NYSE:HUBS), with a total stake value of $2.2 billion.Artisan Partners, an investment management company, mentioned HubSpot, Inc. (NYSE:HUBS) in its second-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“Demand for HubSpot, Inc. (NYSE:HUBS)’s customer relationship management SaaS platform has been robust as companies continue to make front office investments. Despite positive fundamental momentum, shares traded lower during Q2 as investors rotated out of high-growth stocks with elevated multiples. Furthermore, the market has not been favoring solidly profitable businesses that are investing heavily to develop new products and drive new customer additions. Meanwhile, we are monitoring the company’s exposure to small-and-medium-sized businesses given the potential for a recession over the near-to-intermediate term. We recognize a downturn would likely have an impact on HubSpot’s growth metrics, though we believe its mission critical cloud tools— marketing and sales force automation, customer service and website content management—would prove relatively resilient. In addition, the company has moved toward serving somewhat larger customers in recent years, which should offer further protection. For these reasons, and with shares trading at an attractive discount to our PMV estimate, we added modestly to our position.”Like Salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM), Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), HubSpot, Inc.

The negative response, despite bottom-line outperformance, could be attributed to the company’s tepid crude realizations and lower year-over-year revenues.What Did Marathon Oil’s Earnings Unveil?Marathon Oil reported fourth-quarter 2022 adjusted net income per share of 88 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 80 cents and improving from the year-ago profit of 77 cents.Marathon Oil’s bottom line was favorably impacted by stronger oil realizations in the United States and lower overall costs.The company reported revenues of $1.7 billion, which came 1.1% above the consensus mark but fell 3.7% from the year-ago sales of $1.8 billion due to and lower domestic production.In good news for investors, the company is using the excess cash from a supportive environment to reward them with dividends and buybacks. As part of that, MRO executed $2.8 billion in share repurchases in 2022 and hiked dividend seven times in the past eight quarters.Marathon Oil Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMarathon Oil Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMarathon Oil Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Marathon Oil Corporation Quote Segmental PerformanceThis Texas-based energy explorer’s total net production (from U.S. and International units) in the quarter under review came in at 333,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) compared to 353,000 BOE/d in the year-ago period.U.S. E&amp;P: This U.S. upstream unit reported an income of $510 million, down from $553 million in the year-ago period due to weaker production and higher costs, partly offset by higher oil realizations.Marathon Oil’s average realized liquids prices (crude oil and condensate) of $84.29 per barrel were higher than the year-earlier level of $77.03. However, natural gas liquids average price realizations decreased 25.6% to $26.02 a barrel. Moreover, average realized natural gas prices fell 5.9% year over year to $4.93 per thousand cubic feet.Meanwhile, production costs were $6.29 per BOE, representing a 28.4% year-over-year rise.Net production of 278,000 BOE/d was down 8.6% from fourth-quarter 2021. Total U.S. output comprised approximately 56% oil, or 156,000 barrels per day (bpd).Lower year-over-year production from Bakken adversely affected the company’s quarterly performance, which was compounded by lower volumes from the Eagle Ford area. The Eagle Ford region recorded an average production of 91,000 BOE/d, down 2.2% from the level in fourth-quarter 2022, while output from Bakken was 94,000 BOE/d compared with 124,000 BOE/d in the year-ago quarter.

Natural gas and natural gas liquids’ average price realizations came in at 24 cents per thousand cubic feet and $1 a barrel, respectively, the same as the corresponding period of 2021.Story continuesFinancial PositionTotal costs in the quarter were $985 million, $76 million lower than the prior-year period. Marathon Oil reported an adjusted operating cash flow of $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter, essentially unchanged from a year ago.As of Dec 31, 2022, it had cash and cash equivalents worth $334 million and long-term debt of 5.5 billion. The debt-to-capitalization ratio of the company was 34.2.Marathon Oil spent $344 million in capital and exploratory expenditures during the quarter and raked in $763 million in adjusted free cash flow.2023 GuidanceMarathon has budgeted capital spending between $1.9 billion and 42 billion this year. Meanwhile, MRO continues to prioritize shareholder returns over production growth. The company is targeting production in the range of 385,000 BOE/d to 405,000 BOE/d – up more than 15% (at the midpoint) from last year.Further, Marathon expects oil volumes in the band of 185,000-195,000 barrels per day.

(NYSE:MSI) will increase its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 14th of April to $0.88. Even though the dividend went up, the yield is still quite low at only 1.3%. View our latest analysis for Motorola Solutions Motorola Solutions' Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageIt would be nice for the yield to be higher, but we should also check if higher levels of dividend payment would be sustainable. However, prior to this announcement, Motorola Solutions' dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 45.9% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 31% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendMotorola Solutions Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.88 total annually to $3.52. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 15% per annum over that time. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Motorola Solutions has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 29% per annum. Earnings per share is growing at a solid clip, and the payout ratio is low which we think is an ideal combination in a dividend stock as the company can quite easily raise the dividend in the future.Motorola Solutions Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 1 warning sign for Motorola Solutions that investors need to be conscious of moving forward.

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Juniper Networks and Motorola are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that JNPR is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.JNPR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 13.63, while MSI has a forward P/E of 23.58. We also note that JNPR has a PEG ratio of 1.96. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. MSI currently has a PEG ratio of 2.62.Another notable valuation metric for JNPR is its P/B ratio of 2.23. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities.

We continue to be firm in our view that Mr. Benioff and Ms. [President and CFO Amy] Weaver are onboard with steering the company forward, and Q4 is evidence of that.""Story continuesGuggenheimAnalyst: John DiFucciRating/Price Target: Neutral; N/AThe Buzz: ""Over the years, we have consistently said that Salesforce, given its maturity and scale, should let cash flow to the bank rather than throw it at expensive and questionable acquisitions. We had resigned to the conclusion that unwillingness to trim fat, primarily in the S&amp;M org, was a cultural decision, and something that wouldn’t change as long as Marc Benioff was at the helm. Even when the global restructuring was announced in January, we sized the potential FY24 margin improvement as at least 500 bps, but were skeptical of that actually happening. So we’re surprised that Mr. Benioff and team are finally giving investors margin, and seemingly in the form of FCF too, given the signaling of a pause in M&amp;A (e.g., termination of a board M&amp;A committee), at least for now.""Goldman SachsAnalyst: Kash RanganRating/Price Target: Buy; $320The Buzz: ""F4Q23 should change the narrative towards the path to profitable growth and reinforce our belief (articulated last week) that Salesforce is at an inflection point that can vault it into the upper echelons of highly valued tech companies.""Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Joining me now is Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff. Marc, always great to get some time with you.Normally I would style this off talking about earnings, but there was a lot going on that earnings call. What stood out to me is you saying you have hit this hyperspace button. What is that button, and what did you mean?MARC BENIOFF: Brian, it's great to be with you again, and I'm so thrilled. And well, we were together at Dreamforce, and you were there when we laid out our profitability framework that by fiscal year '26, that we would exceed 25% margins. Well, we actually did that today. We hit that hyperspace button, accelerated everything by two years. We delivered for this quarter an incredible 29.2% operating margin while also delivering 17% revenue growth. It was pretty awesome this quarter, and I couldn't be more proud of our team and what everyone has done to make this happen.BRIAN SOZZI: You also talked about it being a new day at Salesforce. Walk us through that.MARC BENIOFF: Well, I think it's connected to what we're talking about. We've really been focused on getting to higher levels of margin and higher levels of profitability. And now you can see the North Star more than 30% how we're moving forward as a company. It's not just being the number-one CRM in the world. Obviously that's incredibly important for this company in sales and service, in marketing, in commerce, in all of our critical areas where our customers connect with their customers.Story continuesBut to really also deliver all the financial metrics, we want to be the most profitable software company in the world, one of the very largest, which we are, and also the highest cash flows. You saw we delivered more than $7.1 billion in cash flow for the year. These were incredible numbers. And we're committed to much higher results.BRIAN SOZZI: Marc, I was talking to a couple of analysts while the earnings call was going on. I think you knocked them off their seats with a call-out of a 30% operating margin by the first quarter of what, calendar 2024? How do you get there? Do you need more headcount reductions? Does the economy have to come back? How do you hit that number?MARC BENIOFF: Well, you can see the direction. We've had increases in our operating margin each and every year in the last five years. But you'll see also that we were able to, exactly like you said, hit the hyperspace button. Look, we added 4 points this year-- not 4 basis points, 4 points in operating margin. And next year, we're going to add-- or the current year that we're in, fiscal year '24, 4 and 1/2 points. So directionally, we're going in this incredible area, and we're moving as fast as we can into the '30s.BRIAN SOZZI: I would love to unpack a couple of things you mentioned on this call. Let's start with you working with the team at Bain. Are you trying to find more efficiencies? Why did you tap them, and what are you working on with them?MARC BENIOFF: Well, I should just bring them in or knock on the-- I should just hit my foot on the floor because they're actually in our building, which is how I know Manny, the CEO of Bain is here. I bump into him on the elevator all the time. And I said to him, hey, we're trying-- and our company, we're a scaled software company now, the number-three software company in the world. We want to improve these financial performance metrics.And he has just a whole playbook he just rips out and just says, here we go. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. We're already implementing a lot of his ideas. There's a lot more to do. Honestly, we're just getting started. I couldn't be more excited about where we are, but I couldn't be more excited about where we're going. And Bain is going to be an important part of Salesforce's future, and Manny especially.BRIAN SOZZI: Where do you see Salesforce going?MARC BENIOFF: Well, look. We're moving into this incredible new AI world, where everything and anything and everyone is all connected. And to make that happen, we're going to have to have a level of technology infrastructure inside all of our customers that's really completely different than we have today.A great example is Ford Ford, I have a Mach-E. I also have the new Ford Lightning. These are electric cars that are autonomous. The Lightning's an electric truck. It's really cool. But all the telemetry data and all the connectivity from those cars is going into our data cloud. And that data cloud then ingests it, and then through our artificial intelligence, through the real-time capabilities, through the automation, it's communicating back to me as I hit different thresholds of product performance.And I get texts, I get emails, I get offers, I'm getting sold, I'm getting serviced, all through my data cloud. It's this connectivity between Salesforce's core clouds and this new world that we're in-- that is really exciting to me. You saw incredible traction this quarter. It became our fastest-growing cloud.But not just at Ford. At companies like Boston Scientific-- they did amazing things with the Data Cloud. F1, the guys who do the sports racing-- 99% of their customers they never even get to meet-- Data Cloud connects them all automagically. And this is what's getting me excited, that we're going to be a huge player in the new AI world.BRIAN SOZZI: For the layperson out there that is not as tech-savvy as you, Marc, talk to us about EinsteinGPT. Is that going to go to battle with the Microsoft ChatGPT? Explain it to us.MARC BENIOFF: Well, Einstein is our core artificial intelligence platform at Salesforce. You know we are the leaders in artificial intelligence and CRM and commerce. We've delivered incredible results for our customers, making sure that when their customers are online, buying from them, we're able to provide an artificial intelligence framework that we've been developing for a decade that is really, incredibly state-of-the-art.With this next generation of generative AI, what it means is that that AI is going to be able to do even more for you. It can code for you. It can write letters for you if you're a sales executive or a service executive. It's going to be able to create content. There's a lot of things that AI is able to do today that we couldn't do 10 years ago. And we're really about to enter an incredible new world where AI is going to really help all of our customers be more productive, have higher performance, and ultimately be far more profitable.BRIAN SOZZI: Marc, I hope it doesn't start creating finance content. I need to be out here keeping this gig. Please, please. I just can't. I can't take that stuff. All right. So we have EinsteinGPT. Second thing that picked up to me on this earnings call-- and I almost cannot believe I heard it-- you disbanded your M&amp;A committee. Holy cow. That is a big signal, I think, you said to investors. I mean, just walk us through that.MARC BENIOFF: Well, we've done some great acquisitions here in MuleSoft and Tableau, both who had great quarters in the fourth quarter. Slack, which I know you use at Yahoo very aggressively-- it's a great product.By the way, it'll be a huge part of the AI future, because Slack, for so many of our customers, is a critical data set for their AI future, as well as a user interface into AI. A lot of these new AI startups that are emerging in the Bay Area-- they're all Slack-first companies, and they use Slack as the primary interface to their AI system. So that's something that we're going to definitely be demonstrating.And when we walk in, we don't have to do the development work for the AI to Slack. It's already done, because that's how they kind of built their whole company. But this is really where the world is moving to. We're having a new kind of world, and our acquisitions have set us up very well for that world.At the same time, for us to deliver these much higher levels of profitability and performance that we're committed to, new levels of prioritization of our core organic products like Data Cloud-- Brian, that's going to mean that we're going to have to slow down and mitigate what we've been doing with M&amp;A.And so we disbanded our M&amp;A committee to do that. We created a new Business Transformation Committee to focus on profitability. And hey, well, you can see it in the results this quarter. 29.2% operating margin. We delivered $8.4 billion in revenue. Brian, how many software companies have you reported on that have ever delivered a quarter quite like that?BRIAN SOZZI: Fair point, Marc. So is the day of the big acquisition in Salesforce done for the next 24 months?MARC BENIOFF: Well, I certainly think so. I mean, it's impossible to predict the future. You know that. But what I really can say is, we're really focused on our profitability, our core performance, these financial metrics. That's why we delivered a great fourth quarter. That's why we're going to deliver a great fiscal year '24.We're now estimating that we're going to deliver almost $35 billion in revenue this year with 27% operating margin. This is what Salesforce is really focused on today, while also-- we just hit an absolute record low in customer attrition because our customer success has never been higher. So all of these things are working together, and they're working very well for us here.BRIAN SOZZI: There's a couple changes coming to your board. Why have you made those changes?MARC BENIOFF: We've had some great experiences with our board. We've had two board members that we're sadly having to say goodbye to. They've been with us for 20 years. Sandy Robertson and Allen Hassenfeld-- incredible executives who have really guided the last two decades of our performance.And we're saying hello to three great new executives. I mean, one of them has been part of our ecosystem. You might have seen him at Dreamforce when you were there, Brian. Mason Morfit, the CEO of ValueAct Capital. He was not just at Dreamforce and has met with our customers and spent time with all of our executives and employees, but built these incredible decks showing us new levels of performance that we could get, and a distribution strategy and pricing.He was on the board of Microsoft, so he has incredible wisdom from that and from running ValueAct as the CEO. So we said, Mason, you should really be on our board. You're really adding value like we've never seen from an outsider. His founder, Jeff Ubben, also was someone who was there at Dreamforce with us. He's an old friend of mine for many years-- incredibly wise and enlightened person as well. And we're like, wow. Mason, come in and help us.And then Sachin Mehra-- Mastercard's a great customer of ours. The chief financial officer-- he has incredible financial engineering expertise. We've asked him to join our board. And probably one of my favorite CEOs of all time, one of the top CEOs in the world, Arnold Donald is also joining our board. So we have three great new board members. And that's five new board members in the last 16 months. Incredible.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, I've gotten to know Arnold Donald through the years. He's been very informative.MARC BENIOFF: Just great person, isn't it? Just great person.BRIAN SOZZI: Let me ask you this, Marc. I've been doing this for a while. I know I may appear young, but I have been doing this for a while. I've never seen--MARC BENIOFF: You don't appear that young, Brian.BRIAN SOZZI: Thanks so much. I appreciate it. Thank you so much for the raw honesty. The active situation-- I have never seen anything like this. Is there a resolution in sight? How does this all end, and how do you move beyond it?MARC BENIOFF: Well, look. I can really learn from anyone, and I enjoy meeting new people, and I enjoy talking to folks. And look, there's lots of different levels of understanding of enterprise software. There's different understandings of our company, who our customers are. But it doesn't matter what grade all these folks are at. I'm trying to ingest and learn and understand their perspectives.I think it's extremely important that I have a beginner's mind. You know I like to practice the Japanese concept of shoshin. How do I have a beginner's mind? And in the expert's mind, Brian, there's no possibilities. The beginner's mind-- there's every possibility. And that is really my approach with everything that has been going on with Salesforce. And it's been great.And then out of that, wow. I was just really blown away with Mason Morfit and how he was able to just grok what we're doing at Salesforce but then deliver these-- like I said, these decks, which outlined what we thought was just strategic directions for our company that really showed his expertise. And that's why we've added him onto our board.BRIAN SOZZI: Marc, you've long been seen as a pioneer in software but also in the business community. And you're a co-founder of this really large company. How has this been, to go through a situation like this?MARC BENIOFF: I'm having the time of my life. I mean, this has been 24 years. You've been along the way for a long time too. You've been to all our events. You've talked to so many of our customers and our employees.And look, this is great. Who would have thought 24 years ago when I was a few blocks away from here at the top of Telegraph Hill in an apartment overlooking Mount Diablo before it had all this gorgeous snow covering that it has today? I would say, we could never have imagined that we would have delivered one of the very largest and most important software companies in the world. So I'm very grateful to everyone who's been part of this journey, and I couldn't be happier with where we are today and where we're going.BRIAN SOZZI: Where do you see yourself in the next decade, Marc? What's your next act?MARC BENIOFF: I'm right here in the present moment, Brian, which is where I think you should be, too.[APPLAUSE]BRIAN SOZZI: Well, I've got to ask the tough questions, though, Marc. I've got to ask these things I have to. It's just part of the gig.MARC BENIOFF: I am having a great time, and I am just loving being the CEO of Salesforce. If you're trying to allude to what my succession strategy is, I mean, you've been following the company a long time. You know I always have a strong successor in place. I always have a strong number two. I always have a strong management team. That's what I love. And that's what I'm very much committed to at the board.BRIAN SOZZI: Is that person inside the company? Do you have a group of people?MARC BENIOFF: Oh, we definitely have people inside the company. Absolutely. And that is something that we'll continue to develop and grow and enhance and make sure that that's a core part of our strategy. And it always has been, and it always will be.BRIAN SOZZI: Salesforce co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff. Thank you so much. I know it's a busy time. We'll talk to you soon.MARC BENIOFF: Thanks for taking the time, Brian. All the best. We'll talk.BRIAN SOZZI: Of course. Thank you.]"

The company also unveiled a new $20 billion stock buyback plan and told investors on an earnings call it ""disbanded"" its internal M&amp;A committee, an important signal to investors clamoring for tighter spending.Shares surged 16% in pre-market trading, and Salesforce's ticker page rocketed up the most visited list on the Yahoo Finance platform.""We have hit the hyper-space button,"" Benioff told Yahoo Finance, referring to initiatives to move faster and improve profitability.The barrage of seemingly positive earnings news runs counter to the activist investor and executive departure narrative that has descended on Salesforce in recent months.Co-CEO Bret Taylor is no longer co-CEO of Salesforce — instead he's off to launch an A.I. startup, the serial entrepreneur told Yahoo Finance. Slack founder Stewart Butterfield, who stayed on when the company was acquired by Salesforce, is still founder but no longer with the parent company.The company is also staring down the barrel of five sharks in the field of activist money management: Elliott Management, Starboard Value, Inclusive Capital, ValueAct, and Third Point.[Read More: Salesforce's activist investors: Who are they, and what do they want?]Yahoo Finance speaks with Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff at Dreamforce 2022.This is an unprecedented activist versus public company battle, pros have said to Yahoo Finance. Sources have told Yahoo Finance the activist group is clamoring for much better profit margins, a halt on acquisitions, and succession plan to Benioff as CEO.A source familiar with Elliott's thinking tells Yahoo Finance discussions with Salesforce have been ""intense"" and no settlement has been reached. Elliott plans to nominate several people to Salesforce's board and would like further expense cuts, the source said.Story continues""Salesforce's set of announcements today represents progress towards regaining investor trust. The acceleration of margin targets, commitment to responsible capital-return priorities, creation of a business transformation committee and disbanding of the M&amp;A committee are necessary steps forward. These steps are consistent with our recommendations, and we believe they will help restore value at Salesforce,"" Elliott said in a statement late on Wednesday.It's unclear if Salesforce's fresh overtures to the activists — such as the upped buyback plan, shout-out to new cost-cutting efforts by working with Bain, a promise of a 27% operating margin in 2023 (and 30% by 1Q24) and pulling back on M&amp;A — will satisfy the group.Benioff didn't indicate if a resolution with the activists was near. Elliott's statement suggests more work needs to be done, however.Benioff added that large acquisitions were likely off the table for the foreseeable future.""Shareholders now part of the Ohana with significant upside to growth + profitability,"" Citi analyst Tyler Radke said.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Yes, even millennials and Generation Z will at some point be yelling at kids to get off their lawn. Given that we’re talking about an absolutely guaranteed outcome, the narrative for baby boomer-geared investments seems attractive.To be sure, one can’t guarantee that all or any of the below baby boomer stocks to buy will rise in value. However, the hard numbers suggest that investors should plan ahead. According to the Pew Research Center, millions of boomers retire each year from the U.S. labor force. Additionally, the pace of these retirements accelerated since the coronavirus pandemic. Therefore, it’s not just millennials that you should be paying attention to. Below are top baby boomer stocks to buy.ABAllianceBernstein$39.23WELLWelltower$74.87SKTTanger Factory Outlet$18.68WBAWalgreens Boots Alliance$35.80ENSGEnsign Group$89.83ADTADT.$7.92AMZNAmazon$93.50InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAllianceBernstein (AB)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockFrequent InvestorPlace readers may recognize AllianceBernstein (NYSE:AB) as one of the Nancy Pelosi stocks to consider. Given that the global asset management firm commands such interest from high-profile individuals, AB certainly deserves top honors for baby boomer stocks to buy. Primarily, the company caters to institutional, high-net-worth and retail investors. It’s the elite helping the elite.Further, baby boomers hold the most wealth in this nation as an age cohort, which isn’t surprising. Moreover, it’s not too much of a stretch to assume that these folks will want premium guidance. Fortunately, AllianceBernstein only hires the best and therefore can navigate clients through thick and thin.Per Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value, AB pings as significantly undervalued. Objectively, AllianceBernstein features a return on equity of 16.49%, indicating an extremely high-quality enterprise.Story continuesFinally, Wall Street analysts peg AB as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $41.50, implying 5% upside potential. As well, the company carries a forward yield of 7.08%. Thus, it’s a solid candidate for baby boomer stocks to buy.Welltower (WELL)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comA real estate investment trust (REIT), Welltower (NYSE:WELL) specializes in healthcare infrastructure. Specifically, it provides real estate capital to leading seniors housing operators, post-acute care providers and health systems. Naturally, WELL practically sells itself as one of the baby boomer stocks to buy. Since the January opener, shares gained nearly 14%.To be fair, Welltower will require some patience from prospective investors. Financially, its balance sheet features only modest strengths. Mathematically, its Altman Z-Score of 1.38 sits in the distressed zone, reflecting higher-than-average bankruptcy risk in the next two years. As well, its profitability took a hit since the imposition of the post-pandemic new normal.So, why mention it among baby boomer stocks to buy? Mainly, the narrative remains compelling. Moreover, as society settles into the new normal, Welltower’s financials could improve.Finally, Wall Street believes in WELL, pegging shares as a consensus moderate buy. Analysts’ price target of $80.50 implies almost 6% upside potential. Plus, the company carries a forward yield of 3.2%.Tanger Factory Outlet (SKT)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Without getting into macabre details, getting older can stink as social networks fade away. Younger family members understandably may be focused on building their lives. As well, when people age, things happen. From that perspective, Tanger Factory Outlet (NYSE:SKT) might be one of the baby boomer stocks to buy. The business combines social integration with consumer retail discounts.Another notable circumstance is that more than a decade ago, brick-and-mortar retail destinations made a concerted effort to make their stores senior-friendly. With Covid-19 largely out of the picture, SKT could be intriguing.In fairness, much like Welltower, investors will need plenty of patience with SKT. However, it does offer some attractive attributes. For instance, its price-to-sales ratio sits at 4.45 times, lower than the industry median of 7.12 times. As well, SKT trades at 10.19-times free cash flow (FCF), rank below nearly 72% of the competition.Lastly, analysts peg SKT as a consensus hold. However, their average price target of $20 implies over 6% upside potential. Further, Tanger carries a forward yield of 4.68%.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comA holding company, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) owns the retail pharmacy chains Walgreens and Boots. Fundamentally, the case for WBA as one of the baby boomer stocks to buy makes plenty of sense. Again, stuff happens when you become a senior citizen – not all of it pleasant. Therefore, these folks may require more trips to their local pharmacies, cynically boding well for WBA.Also, it’s interesting that on the first Tuesday of every month, Walgreens hosts Seniors Day. This program gives those ages 55 and up 20% off select purchases. From that angle, WBA screams as a prime candidate for baby boomer stocks to buy.As with the other ideas on this list, Walgreens will require patience. However, it offers an attractive discount. For instance, WBA trades at a forward multiple of 8.05. This stat sits well below the industry median value of 25.4.Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg WBA as a consensus hold. However, their average price target of $39.75 implies nearly 10% upside potential. Moreover, Walgreens carries a forward yield of 5.3%.Ensign Group (ENSG)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comAccording to its website, Ensign Group (NASDAQ:ENSG) specializes in post-acute care. Its broad spectrum of businesses includes assisted living, skilled nursing and rehabilitative care. Naturally, with advanced age comes certain challenges. Therefore, ENSG sells itself as one of the baby boomer stocks to buy. Notably, over the trailing year, ENSG gained nearly 13% of equity value.While every investment carries risks, Ensign’s financials feature arguably more positives than other senior-specific entities. For instance, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 13.5%, above 64% of its peers. Its net margin pings at 7.43%, outpacing 72.29% of the competition.Moreover, the market prices ENSG at a forward multiple of 19.25. As a discount to earnings, Ensign ranks better than 65.49% of sector peers.Looking to the Street, covering analysts peg ENSG as a consensus strong buy. Additionally, their average price target stands at $108, implying over 20% upside potential. Thus, it’s a growth-oriented candidate for baby boomer stocks to buy.ADT (ADT)image of businessperson and bar graph with dollar signs to represent undervalued stocksSource: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.comIf you peruse the cesspool of internet forums on the topic of crime and self-defense, you’ll eventually encounter quite a few keyboard commandos. While it might sound romantic to blast baddies away, here’s the deal: criminals often target senior citizens because of their diminished physical vitality (relative to their youth). Therefore, security system and solutions provider ADT (NYSE:ADT) ranks among the top baby boomer stocks to buy.While millions of millennials take care of their boomer parents, they can’t be there for them all the time. And that’s where security systems like ADT offer incredible relevance. Perhaps not surprisingly, ADT gained slightly over 12% of equity value in the trailing year.To be fair, ADT carries some flaws in its financials. Its balance sheet could use some work, particularly its low cash-to-debt ratio. Also, its net margin slipped into negative territory in the trailing year. However, the market prices ADT at a forward multiple of 12.66. That’s below the sector median of 14.49.Finally, analysts peg ADT as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $10.50, implying over 30% upside potential.Amazon (AMZN)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comWith e-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), we’re not exactly talking about an exclusive player among baby boomer stocks to buy. If we’re being totally honest, Amazon caters to the youth and youthfully minded. After all, the company’s diving headfirst into several burgeoning sectors, such as cloud computing and machine learning. That’s not exactly what you think about when considering boomers.Still, e-commerce as a percentage of total retail sales accelerated since the first quarter of 2022. Part of that demand could stem from seniors. Basically, they can order whatever they want and have it delivered, which represents a significant convenience.To be fair, Gurufocus.com warns that AMZN may be a possible value trap. if I’m being completely transparent, the skyrocketing inflation of 2022 didn’t help matters financially. Still, Amazon remains a growth machine. For instance, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 21.9%, outpacing over 84% of the competition.Lastly, Wall Street analysts love AMZN, pegging it a consensus strong buy. As well, their average price target stands at $137.05, implying 43% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

When he steps down in April, he hands over the reins to Laxman Narasimhan. Investors are hopeful he takes a softer stance with union negotiations.

The company also needs to record and distribute a video of the meeting, as well as post paper copies of the notice in its stores across the country.The judge also ordered Starbucks to compensate workers he deemed to have been unlawfully punished for their union activism. In addition, Rosas concluded that Starbucks had tainted a failed union vote at one Buffalo store, and ordered the company to bargain with the union.“This is truly a historic ruling,” Gary Bonadonna Jr., the regional head of Workers United, which is helping Starbucks employees to unionize, in a statement.Story continuesStarbucks did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment.

Since then, employees at hundreds of Starbucks stores have voted to join the union.Open letterAlso on Wednesday, several dozen Starbucks employees and managers signed an open letter complaining about the company’s anti-union activity, as well as its return-to-office mandate. In January, Schultz ordered corporate employees to return to the office at least three days a week.“We love Starbucks, but these actions are fracturing trust in Starbucks leadership,” said the letter.Yet Schultz believes the union drive was caused by a lack of leadership—specifically, his leadership. “The unions showed up because Starbucks was not leading in a way that was consistent with its history in terms of being a values-based company, and I came back to basically restore those values,” he said in an interview with CNN last week.Schultz also said the unionization in companies like Starbucks and Apple was indicative of deeper social issues. “I was shocked, stunned to hear the loneliness, the anxiety, the fracturing trust in government, the fracturing trust in companies, fracturing trust in family, a lack of hope in terms of opportunity” among Starbucks employees, he told CNN.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeHow to save money in 7 easy steps The best boarding schools: where the world's elite are sending their kidsThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home]"

Rosas found that Starbucks had threatened employees, spied on them and more strictly enforced dress codes and other policies.The order requires Starbucks to reinstate seven workers who were fired for their union activity and provide financial restitution for 27 other workers for violations like refusing to grant time off. It also requires Starbucks to bargain with the union at multiple stores and reopen a location in Cheektowaga, New York, that was closed amid significant union activity.Starbucks said Wednesday it believes the decision and the remedies ordered are inappropriate and is considering its legal options. The parties in the case have until March 28 to file an appeal to the full National Labor Relations Board.Starbucks said the individuals in the case were fired for clear violations of the company’s policies, and not because of union activities.But union supporters were elated with the ruling, saying it will help energize their campaign.""This decision results from months of tireless organizing by workers in cafes across the country demanding better working conditions in the face of historical, monumental, and now deemed illegal union-busting,” said Michelle Eisen, a Starbucks barista and union organizer in Buffalo.Story continuesEisen's store voted to unionize in late 2021, the first Starbucks in decades to take that step. At least 289 of Starbucks’ 9,000 company-owned U.S. stores have voted to unionize since then.Workers are seeking better pay, improved training and more consistent schedules, among other things. The company says it already provides industry-leading benefits and believes its stores function best when it works directly with employees.The ruling came on the same day that U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont Independent, announced an upcoming vote that could force Shultz to testify about the union campaign before the Senate's labor committee.]"

Core market growth and Diversify, Decarbonize and Digitize (3D) strategy are driving the company’s bookings. Also, its realignment activities are helping it capture more margin enhancement opportunities with efficient cost management and higher productivity. For 2023, the company expects bookings of $2.7 billion driven by supportive end markets. Revenues are anticipated to increase in the range of 9-11% from the prior-year reported figure.In February 2023, Flowserve inked a deal to acquire Velan Inc. in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $245 million. The buyout will strengthen FLS’ valves portfolio and build upon its existing assets through the addition of Velan’s premier brands, strong heritage and technical expertise in diverse end markets. Velan will become part of Flowserve’s Flow Control Division (FCD) segment. The deal is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2023.Flowserve utilizes its cash flow to reward its shareholders by distributing dividends. The company paid out dividends worth $104.5 million to its shareholders in 2022.However, FLS has been witnessing supply-chain challenges and logistics problems. Flowserve’s cost of sales increased 5.1% and selling, general and administrative expenses rose 2.3%, year over year in 2022. A potential recessionary environment is expected to weaken its GDP-driven markets, including chemicals and general industries.Foreign exchange is an added headwind for FLS, given its widespread presence in the international markets. A stronger U.S. dollar might dampen the company's overseas business results in the quarters ahead.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the past year, this current Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has increased 9.1% compared with the industry’s 5.1% rise.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked companies from the Industrial Products sector are discussed below:Deere &amp; Company DE presently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Due to these headwinds, shares of the company have declined 26.9% in the past six months compared with the industry’s decrease of 10.9%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper to unearth the factors that are weighing on the stock’s performance.3M’s Safety and Industrial segment is experiencing weakness due to softness in disposable respirator demand. In the fourth quarter, lower disposable respirator demand hurt organic sales by $165 million. For 2023, the company expects an impact of $450-$550 million from this headwind. Organic sales are expected to decline in the low-single digits for the segment in 2023. The Transportation &amp; Electronics unit is experiencing weakness due to a decline in consumer electronics demand, particularly for smartphones, tablets and TVs. This can be attributed to reduced consumer spending due to continued inflationary pressure. Reduced consumer spending is also hurting the Healthcare and Consumer segments’ performances. Weakness in the medical solutions business is weighing on the Healthcare segment’s performance.For 2023, the company expects healthcare segment organic sales to increase in the low to mid-single digits from the year-ago period. Organic sales in the Consumer segment are predicted to decline in the low-single digits in 2023.Raw material and logistics cost inflation as well as supply-chain disruptions, including labor shortages, are affecting 3M’s bottom-line performance. The slowdown in China due to coronavirus-induced disruptions and moderating demand across industrial end markets have also weighed on the company’s shares.Given significant international operations, foreign currency headwinds have also been a drag on MMM’s price performance. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar hurt the company’s sales by 5% in the fourth quarter. For 2023, the company expects foreign currency translation to hurt adjusted sales by 1-2%. Also, divestitures are expected to impact adjusted sales by 1%.Amid multiple headwinds, 3M has provided a bearish outlook for 2023. For 2023, the company expects adjusted sales to decrease 2-6% year over year due to a decline in disposable respirator demand and adverse foreign currency movements. The company anticipates organic sales to either decline to 3% or remain flat year over year due to an estimated two percentage point negative impact from the disposable respirator decline and the cessation of its operations in Russia.3M anticipates adjusted earnings of $8.50-$9.00 for 2023 ($9.88 was reported in 2022). The guidance includes a negative impact of 55-80 cents from the decline in disposable respirator demand, the exit of Russia operations, foreign currency translation and divestitures.Story continuesZacks Rank &amp; Key Picks3M presently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks worth considering are as follows:Deere &amp; Company DE currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The company assumes no obligations to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. I would now like to hand the call over to Rodney Sacks.Story continuesRodney Cyril SacksThank you, Tom. The company achieved record fourth quarter net sales of $1.51 billion in the 2022 fourth quarter, 6.2% higher than net sales of $1.43 billion in the 2021 comparable period and 11.9% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent global supply chain challenges and disruptions, the company has prioritized product availability for its consumers and customers despite adversely impacting gross margins and operating income. The company continues to stand by its strategy to ensure product availability and solidify the continued long-term growth of the company's brands. CANarchy was acquired in February 2022 to facilitate the company's entry into the alcohol beverage sector. During 2022, CANarchy sustained margin pressures, cost of acquisition and integration as well as certain other costs in preparation for the launch of the company's new alcohol product lines. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2022 fourth quarter was 51.8% compared with 53.9% in the comparative 2021 fourth quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2022 fourth quarter as compared to the 2021 fourth quarter was primarily the result of: one, increased ingredients and other input costs, including secondary packaging materials and increased co-packing fees; two, geographical and product sales mix; and three, increased logistical costs. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2022 fourth quarter was partially offset by pricing actions. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased on a sequential quarterly basis to 51.8% in the 2022 fourth quarter from 51.3% in the 2022 third quarter. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, excluding gross profit for the company's Alcohol Brands segment increased on a sequential quarterly basis to 52.5% in the 2022 fourth quarter from 51.9% in the 2022 third quarter. We continue to believe that some of these increased costs we are experiencing are likely to be transitory. The depletion of our remaining higher cost imported can inventories will continue over the next few quarters and should be fully utilized during 2023. We note that our major promotion in the fourth quarter was executed with lower-cost, locally sourced cans in the United States and globally. We estimate that of the increasing costs of sales in the 2022 fourth quarter, approximately $60 million, was comprised of: One, approximately $39.6 million due to increased ingredient and other input costs, including primary and secondary packaging materials and increased co-packing fees; two, approximately $12.5 million due to geographical and product sales mix; and three, approximately $7.9 million due to increased logistical costs. We continue to experience significant increases in distribution expenses, primarily the result of increased warehousing expenses as well as other logistical expenses, which adversely impacted operating expenses. The company continues to address the challenges in its supply chain as it navigates through the uncertainty of the current global supply chain environment. We are starting to see a reduction in freight rates in the United States. Operating expenses for the 2022 fourth quarter was $390 million compared with $354.7 million in the 2021 fourth quarter. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2022 fourth quarter were 25.8% compared with 24.9% in the 2021 fourth quarter and 28.9% in the 2019 fourth quarter pre-COVID. Distribution expenses for the 2022 fourth quarter increased to $76.1 million, which is an increase of 9% or 5% of net sales compared to $69.8 million or 0.9% of net sales in the 2021 fourth quarter and 3.5% of net sales in the 2019 fourth quarter pre-COVID. The $6.3 million increase in distribution expenses was primarily due to higher warehouse expenses of $11.2 million as a result of higher raw materials and finished product inventories in the United States and EMEA, partially offset by decreased freight after expenses of $4.4 million. The increase in other operating expenses was primarily due to increased payroll expenses and increased general and administrative expenses. We are now able to purchase aluminum cans from local sources globally. We have seen a reduction in cost of sales through increased use of domestic cans as we continue to cycle through existing inventories of imported cans over the next few quarters. We have rebuilt finished product inventory levels globally to return to our orbit strategy of producing closer proximity to our customers. The cost of repositioning finished products to distribution centers are included in freight-in costs. Operating income for the 2022 fourth quarter decreased 4.5% to $394.4 million from $412.9 million in the 2021 comparative quarter. Net income decreased 6.1% to $301.7 million as compared to $321.3 million in the 2021 comparable quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2022 fourth quarter decreased 4.9% to $0.57 from $0.60 in the fourth quarter of 2021. Diluted earnings per share, exclusive of the Alcohol segment operating losses and the adverse impacts of foreign currency exchange rates, net of tax, was $0.64 in the 2022 fourth quarter. Through pricing actions, the company was able to achieve positive pricing appreciation in the United States and EMEA. Due to continued cost pressures, the company implemented a net sales price increase in the range of 6% market-wide in the United States effective September 1, 2022, and will be implementing a price increase on its 24-ounce line effective April 1, 2023. The company also implemented price increases in the second half of 2022 in certain international markets and will be implementing additional price increases on a phased approach during the first half of 2023 in a number of international markets. The company will continue to review further opportunities for price increases and pricing actions in order to mitigate inflationary pressures.

Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen for the month of December 2022 compared to December 2021, Monster's retail market share in value increased in Argentina from 43% to 53.5%; in Chile, from 34.5% to 41.7%; in Brazil for the month end January 2023, our share increased from 39.9% to 41.1%. Monster is the leading energy brand in value in Argentina, Brazil and Chile. I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period until the end of January '23, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year, grew from 14.2% to 15.2% in Belgium, from 30.7% to 31.8% in France, from 29.5% to 31% in Great Britain, from 27.3% to 32.7% in Norway, from 27.7% to 27.8% in the Republic of Ireland, from 38.6% to 40.4% in Spain and from 15.1% to 16.5% in Sweden. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year declined from 8.1% to 4.7% in the Netherlands and from 20% to 19.2% in South Africa. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period until the end of December 2022, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 16.3% to 18.4% in the Czech Republic, from 26.5% to 27.8% in Denmark, and from 27.6% to 13.5% in Italy. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year declined from 14.6% to 13.9% in Germany, from 38.1% to 36.8%, and decreased from 19% to 18.3% in Poland. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period until the end of December 2022, Predator's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 20.4% to 31.1% in Kenya and from 14.2% to 19.2% in Nigeria. According to IRI in Australia, Monster's market share in value for the 4 weeks ending January 29, 2023, increased from 13.1% to 16.1% as compared to the same period the previous year. Mother's market share in value decreased from 11% to 10.7%. According to IRI in New Zealand, Monster's market share in value for the 4 weeks ended January 22, 2023 remained at 13% as compared to the same period the previous year. Live+ market share in value decreased from 6.7% to 6.1%, and Mother's market share in value increased from 5.8% to 6%. According to INTAGE in Japan in the month ending December 2022, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 53.7% to 54.7%. According to Nielsen in South Korea in the month ending December 2022, Monster's market share in value in all after it's combined as compared to the same period the previous year, increased from 60.2% to 64.2%. Again, point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or 4-week periods may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods. Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $542.5 million, 35.9% of total net sales in the 2022 fourth quarter compared to $508.1 million or 35.7% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2021. Foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact on net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $81.9 million in the 2022 fourth quarter. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S., transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. In EMEA, net sales in the 2022 fourth quarter decreased 2.3% in dollars but increased 14.7% in local currencies over the same period in 2021. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales in the fourth quarter was 33.9% compared with 32.6% in the same quarter in 2021 and compared to 34.7% in the third quarter of 2022. The company is continuing to address the controllable challenges in its supply chain in EMEA. We're also pleased that in the 2022 fourth quarter, Monster gained market share in Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Great Britain, Italy, Norway, the Republic of Ireland, Spain and Sweden. In Asia Pacific, net sales in 2022 fourth quarter increased 0.5 point in dollars and increased 20.6% in local currencies over the same period in 2021. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 42.6% versus 41.4% over the same period in 2021, due in part to a product supply issue with an ingredient that impacted a number of our products in Japan, but has now been resolved, net sales in the 2022 fourth quarter decreased 14.4% in dollars but increased 10% in local currency. Sales in the 2022 fourth quarter continued to be impacted by COVID in certain channels. In South Korea, net sales increased 13.9% in dollars and increased 34.4% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2021. Monster remains the market leader in Japan and in South Korea. In China, sales volume in the fourth quarter increased 5.4% as compared to the same quarter in 2021, largely impacted by COVID-related lockdowns. We remain optimistic about the prospects for the Monster brand in China. In Oceana, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales increased 2.9% in dollars and 16.7% in local currencies. In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the 2022 fourth quarter increased 45.2% in dollars and increased 57.7% in local currencies over the same period in 2021. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 28.4% for the 2022 fourth quarter versus 38.6% in the 2021 fourth quarter. In Brazil, net sales in the 2022 fourth quarter increased by 19.9% in dollars and 16.6% in local currency. Net sales in Mexico increased 64.8% in dollars and 16.6% in local currency in the 2022 fourth quarter. Net sales in Chile increased 1% in dollars but increased 16% in local currencies in the 2022 fourth quarter. Net sales in Argentina increased 92% in dollars and increased 196.6% in local currency in the 2022 fourth quarter. We will now provide an update on our litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which will be referred to as VPX, the maker of Bang Energy Drinks. We previously discussed the trademark infringement arbitration in which an arbitrator found against VPX and awarded Monster Energy company, or MEC and Orange Bang, $175 million in damages, attorney fees and costs and an ongoing 5% royalty on future sales of certain Bang energy products. VPX has appealed the judgment. Additionally, on September 29, 2022, a jury in the United States District Court for the Central District of California returned a verdict awarding MEC approximately $293 million in damages on its claims against VPX for false advertising, misappropriation of trade secrets and interference with Monster's contracts over shelf space with certain key retailers. The parties are briefing post-trial issues. On October 10, 2022, VPX, along with certain of its domestic subsidiaries and affiliates filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in the Southern District of Florida. While those proceedings are moving forward, VPX has undertaken to make interim royalty payments subject to potential clawbacks in certain circumstances. On February 14, 2023, VPX made its first royalty payment in the amount of approximately $3.6 million. The company will not recognize either award or the royalty payments until such time as they are realized or realizable. As the litigation and bankruptcy proceedings are subjudicate, we will not be answering further questions on those matters on today's call. In the first quarter of 2023, we launched The Beast Unleashed in 6 states through a network of beer distributors. The Beast Unleashed is a flavored malt beverage with 6% alcohol by volume based on Monster's well-known and popular flavor profiles. We are pleased with early results and plan to expand into additional markets in the second quarter of 2023, with the goal of being national by the end of the year. We recently launched Wild Basin Hard Seltzer with new packaging and great new flavors and taste profiles. The Dale's Beer family will get a refresh in the second quarter of 2023, including introduction of Dale's American Light Lager and easy-drinking lager with 4.2% alcohol by volume, 95 calories and 2.5 carbohydrates per 12-ounce serving. Our alcohol beverage innovation pipeline is robust. We look forward to sharing use of additional new products in the future. In the 2022 fourth quarter in the United States, Monster Reserve Orange Dreamsicle was launched at retail to expand Monster Reserve line. Monster Energy Zero Sugar was launched at retail in United States in January 2023. Monster Energy Zero Sugar was specifically developed as an indistinguishable zero sugar analog of our original unique Monster Energy Green flavor. We are excited about the opportunities that this product will provide to our Monster consumers who have come to enjoy the unique taste profile of our original Monster Green flavor, which remains our leading flavor. Earlier this month, we also launched Monster Energy Ultra Strawberry Dreams, Monster Reserve Kiwi Strawberry, Monster Nitro Cosmic Peach and Java Monster Cafe Latte. Initial response from consumers has been positive. In February 2023, we launched a flavor of Reign called Tropical Storm in the United States and also commenced with the launch of Monster Tour Water, a pure unflavored water line in still and sparkling variants in 19.2 ounce cans. We are planning to launch Reign Storm, which is positioned as a total wellness energy drink in 12-ounce sleek cans at retail in March 2023 in 4 flavors to address a compelling opportunity in the energy drink category. We launched several new SKUs in October in Latin America. In Chile, we expanded our Ultra line by launching Ultra Gold and Ultra Watermelon. In Mexico, we introduced Monster Energy Reserve Watermelon. In Puerto Rico, the Cayman Islands, Curacao and Bermuda,we expanded our Reign portfolio and launched Reign White Gummy Bear and Reign REIGNbow Sherbet. In Trinidad and Tobago, we launched Monster Pipeline Punch. In Australia, we expanded our core portfolio and launched Monster Super Dry. In New Zealand, we expanded our juice portfolio and launched Monster Juice Papillon, which is currently exceeding our expectations. In EMEA, in the fourth quarter of 2022, we launched Monster Nitro, Monster Reserve Watermelon and White Pineapple in a number of countries. In certain countries, we also launched juiced Aussie Lemonade Ultra Gold, Ultra Rosa and Ultra Watermelon during the 2022 fourth quarter. During the 2022 fourth quarter, we also launched additional SKUs of Burn and Reign in certain countries. In EMEA as part of an ongoing pan-EMEA launch, we commenced distribution of our Monster Energy Lewis Hamilton 44 Zero Sugar Energy drink in select EMEA markets late in the fourth quarter of 2022 to be followed by an additional 25 EMEA markets in the first quarter of 2023. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we launched Monster Rehab lemon tea in Japan. Monster Ultra Watermelon in Turkey. Monster Ultra Paradise in Vietnam, Predator in Malaysia, and we continued the national rollout of Predator in India. We are planning to introduce the Predator brand in additional countries in APAC during the course of 2023. We estimate that on a foreign currency adjusted basis, including CANarchy, January 2023 sales were approximately 16.1% higher than the comparable January 2022 sales and 13.8% higher than January 2022, excluding CANarchy. We estimate January 2023 sales, including CANarchy to be approximately 12.9% higher than in January 2022 and 10.6% higher than in January 2022, excluding CANarchy. January 2023 had the same number of selling days as January 2022. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production. In some instances, our bottlers are responsible for production and determine their own production schedules. This affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. Furthermore, our bottling and distribution partners maintain inventory levels according to their own internal requirements, which they may alter from time to time for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. If the COVID-19 pandemic and related unfavorable economic conditions continues in certain regions, our new product innovation launches in those regions could be delayed. On November 2, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to an additional 500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. During the 2022 fourth quarter, the company purchased approximately 2.3 million shares of its common stock for a total amount of $201.6 million, excluding broker commissions under the June 2022 repurchase plan, leaving approximately 682.8 million remaining available for repurchase under the previously authorized repurchase programs. The company today announced that its Board of Directors has approved and declared a 2-for-1 split of its common stock that will be effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend. Each stockholder of record on March 13, 2023, will receive a dividend of 1 additional share of common stock for each then held share to be distributed after the close of trading on March 27, 2023. The company anticipates its common stock to begin trading at the split adjusted price on March 28, 2023. In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. One, the energy category continues to grow globally; two, the company has increased its raw material and finished product inventories to better service its customers and ensure availability of its products; three, we are seeing improvement in our gross profit margins on a quarterly sequential basis due to supply chain normalization for our AFF flavor facility in Ireland is now providing a large number of flavors to our EMEA region, enabling better service levels and lower landed costs to our EMEA region. Five, we are enthusiastic for our 23 new product innovations, notably Monster Energy Zero Sugar, which launched in January 2023 in the United States and Monster Energy Lewis Hamilton 44 sugar energy drink in EMEA. We are also particularly enthusiastic for the planned launches of rainstorm in March 2023 as well as Tour Water in the United States. We are pleased with the early results from the launch of The Beast Unleashed, our first flavored malt beverage alcohol product in 6 states and the planned rollout in 2 additional states as well as the additional alcohol opportunities that the CANarchy acquisition presents. Seven, we are planning to launch Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in additional international countries. And finally, eight, we are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury, our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy brands in an additional number of international countries. I would now like to open the floor to questions about the year. Thank you.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And our first question will come from Peter Grom of UBS.Peter K. GromSo Hilton, I guess, I wanted to ask about gross margin. You mentioned in the release that you expect some of these cost pressures you've experienced to be transitory, whereas others remain challenging. And I guess maybe just to start, is there any way to frame how much of the drag on gross margin is still a result of these imported cans? And then just looking ahead in the context of what pricing, the cost backdrop you've outlined and kind of the modest sequential improvement we saw sequentially, how would you frame the margin recapture opportunity looking out to next year?Hilton H. SchlosbergOkay. Well, if you look back at what happened in the fourth quarter, we had a price increase in September 1 in the U.S. We had some price increases internationally during 2022 and into the fourth quarter of 2022. We are increasing pricing in many international markets on a phased basis starting in the early part of 2023. So a lot of the increased costs that we have been absorbing should be accommodated by increased pricing. But looking forward, we all know what's happening with aluminum. It's coming down. Certain other commodities are coming down. In Europe, we see energy coming down. So overall, I think with regard to margin, we are actually in a good place. And as you saw in this quarter, we were able to move margin on a sequential basis. We do, however, have certain costs that are not going away. For example, co-packing fees have gone up. The sugar is in tight supply because of weather situations. So there are positives as well as negatives in the system. As regards to the international cans, we don't have that significant quantity left in terms of what the impact will be on gross margin. So I think we've just got to work through those cans. They are green and ultra-hite. We'll look through them and it will be good. The only issue is that we do have promotional cans from time to time. And as I've spoken on this call on a number of occasions, these cans are not promotional cans. They're just straight cans that we use in non-promotional periods. And also it depends, we have other obligations with our can companies. So it's a question of sourcing cans on the most optimal place to be able to co-pack. So that may be too long an explanation, but I hope it gave you a sense of what we're seeing from the sand.OperatorThe next question comes from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities.Christopher Michael CareySo I just wanted to follow up on that, but then asking question. So Hilton, would you expect sequential gross margin improvement from here on a steady clip, just given pricing and some improvement in commodities or overall cost inflation. I appreciate there are other inflationary factors. But would you expect to continue to sequentially improve from here? So that's just a follow-up. But then from a U.S. perspective, I think one of the things that's coming up tonight is you had mid-single-digit pricing to high single-digit pricing in the U.S. in September and yet U.S. sales were 6%. So can you talk to any -- was there any pull forward of demand because of the pricing actions? Were there any promotions in the quarter behind the pricing? Maybe can you just help reconcile the revenue growth in the quarter in the U.S., which is basically aligned with the pricing that you're taking. So thanks for that follow-up on gross margins in the U.S. comment.Hilton H. SchlosbergOkay. Chris, to answer your first question, we don't give guidance. And I actually gave quite a robust explanation of what we see the runway for margins. So I just really don't want to estimate it because we really don't give guidance. But I think I gave you a good sense of where we are, probably too much, but that is where it is. In respect of the price increase in the U.S. in September, we actually limited the bottlers to the extent of how much they could buy in. So I don't think that there was -- in fact, we don't think there was any much pull forward from Q3. I think it was just a question of the market stabilizing. As you know, with when price increases are put into effect, there's always a little bit of a bump as you go into more steady waters. And everything we know and that we've heard is the price really -- the price increase is actually sticking. So we had a little bit more promotional allowances in the fourth quarter, and you'll see that in the K that is released, but that's really consistent with bleeding in a price increase to a market in the consumer goods industry.Rodney Cyril SacksI think the only other thing I would like to just -- maybe just to add on that is that towards the end of the fourth quarter, I think we were not alone. I think there was a number of companies, felt some softness in the consumer pool in -- primarily in December. But that was -- and that happened. And then we think we've seen an uptick again in January as we've indicated from our January numbers and you could see from the Nielsen numbers. So it probably was a little bit of a combination of just an initial hesitancy from consumers to the price increase and then ultimately just some consumer softness, but that seems to have remedied itself in the first quarter now?OperatorThe next question comes from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.Drew Nolan LevineThis is Drew Levine on for Andrea. So Rodney, I want to continue on that point on the sort of rebound in January, and it also seemed like there was an acceleration for both Monster and the category on a [3-year stack] or 3-year CAGR basis. So just wondering what you're sort of attributing that underlying strength in consumption too, do you think it's product launches, increased interest in the category, gas prices coming down? So any thoughts around that would be helpful.Rodney Cyril SacksI think it's a combination of those things. I think we have got gas prices coming down. I think we have seen sort of -- now sort of increase in convenience. I remember, last year. Convenience was always ahead of the grocery and mass channels. And last year has sort of reversed, and convenience was a little slow. That seems to be coming back a little bit. And we just think that, again, pricing has sort of settled down a bit. But you can see across the whole category, there has been an increase in the Nielsen numbers across the category for most people and competitors. So we're just are seeing just a little bit of resurgence of confidence again.Hilton H. SchlosbergThe other thing I think you should do is have a look at the -- when we announced third quarter results, we spoke about the October sales. And if you look at the October sales, it's not inconsistent with the quarter. And [until about] the fourth quarter of '22, sorry.OperatorThe next question comes from Mark Astrachan of Stifel.Mark Stiefel AstrachanSo hopefully, you're doing all right there, Rodney.Rodney Cyril SacksI am fine, just sort of remnants of a cough for the last couple of weeks.Mark Stiefel AstrachanAll right. That's good. Two questions for you. One sort of related to the recent line of questioning. So inventories were up again sequentially. How do we think about the improvement there? And does that kind of lead into flow-through of improvement in gross margin through '23? And maybe more bigger picture, how do you think about the relative affordability of Monster and energy drinks broadly in the U.S. after the price increase? It seems like if you look at other beverage categories, pricing has been steady riser over the last decade plus, so the gap has sort of narrowed. You took a little bit of pricing but not nearly as much on a cumulative basis. Is there opportunity here to become more price rationale from an energy category standpoint as you kind of move forward?Rodney Cyril SacksWell, let's talk about the first question, Mark, about inventories. As you know, when we went out of 2021, our inventories were just too low. We were unable to service our customers without major upheavals and without major costs. So we -- there was no question that the inventories had to move and move significantly up because bearing in mind where our sales are. But as we are, we believe that we have sufficient inventories, which is important for us to be able to service our customers. Are we working on getting those inventories down? Yes. And these inventories will optimize themselves in due course. So I wouldn't be concerned. Our products have a 2-year shelf life, and it's important that we maintain sufficient inventories to service our customers. And then on that second question you asked about pricing, if you know and look, for example, at a Mountain Dew at Walmart, a 20-ounce Mountain Dew at Walmart, their price is $2.18. And Monster is $2.28, so we -- I think as you look at the energy category, and you kind of, balance the pricing of 20-ounce sodas and energy drinks, remember that we now -- and just twisting over to convenience, we sell more -- energy drink sell more at convenience than carbonated soft drinks. So there is a balance. And I think we have struck a very good balance. With regard to going forward, we have a price increase planned for 24-ounce, which we believe has got opportunity, and we're taking price in 24-ounce up beginning of April. So that will happen. And we'll continue to monitor the opportunities for price increases in the U.S. as we see margins and as we see the carbonated soft drink category, and it's a whole bundle of issues that lead us to move in the direction of whether to take price.OperatorThe next question comes from Filippo Falorni of Citi.Filippo FalorniCan you talk about your expectations for your innovation pipeline in 2023, particularly on a relative basis over the last couple of years, given it seems like you have a pretty substantial pipeline this year, both in alcoholic beverage and your core energy drinks?Rodney Cyril SacksThe fact is that I think that we've actually got a really broad base of innovation, I think that it has sort of improved over the last few years, and I think we're sort of getting it right. I think that will be positive for the brand. We also are being able to secure a little more shelf space across the different channels, which is helping us with innovation because in some cases, we didn't get shelf space in some of the years past, and it was sort of difficult to actually get the innovation to achieve the -- it's -- the benefits that we had hoped for. We think that this year, we will be able to achieve those benefits. We have rationalized some of the SKUs. And we think that we'll be able to get a good selection of our innovation on shelf, particularly the new energy Zero Sugar and also the new Reign subline, which will going to go up against other competitors in the 12-ounce category. And there has been some additional shelf space, not only in the energy category, but also in the sort of wellness category. So I think in some places, we'll also be able to place the Reign Storm sort of line in that area as well. So overall, we think there will be a good contribution going forward from innovation, which is exciting. And so far, initial response to things like our Ultra Strawberry Dreams has been really positive from consumers and bottlers to the Zero Sugar and others. So we are pretty optimistic and upbeat about innovation this year. Also, we are introducing a lot of multipacks to try and increase the take home, particularly in places like grocery. So again, we haven't described them that much on this call, but there's a whole skew of multipack and variety packs that we're doing in a multipack which we think will be positive for the brand this year for sales.OperatorThe next question comes from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank.Stephen Robert R. PowersJust I guess a couple of cleanups on the gross margin topic. The first one is, Rodney, I think at the start of the call, you bridged to a $60 million increase in COGS. I just wanted to clarify what that was. I think if I'm not mistaken, COGS is up like 70 plus. So just exactly what those numbers were and what they weren't, number one? Number two, I don't know if you can comment on the mix of cans in the fourth quarter, old higher cost cans versus current cost cans and if that was materially different than what you had seen in the third quarter? And then three, the Latin America gross margin, you called out sales growth there is fantastic, but the gross margin has been progressively under pressure and was down, I think, 10-plus points in the fourth quarter. Just the drivers there and if you think you've got the ability to turn that gross margin progress around in Latin America?Hilton H. SchlosbergI think, Steve, we spoke about that -- about margins earlier on the call. Margins on a sequential basis were actually up. So I'm really not sure what you're referring to. And the first question that we answered spoke -- I spoke quite heavily about the progression of gross margins and the pluses and the minuses. So maybe I'm missing something, but I think we did discuss margin earlier on the call. And with regard to the $60 million that we spoke about in the release, that was only -- the $60 million was comprised of $39.6 million due to increased ingredients in other input costs and $12.5 million due to geographical product sales mix and $7.9 million due to increased logistical costs. And the rest of the increase in cost of sales was normal increases as you would expect to -- in a normal business environment. Those are the kind of the exceptional ones that we called out.OperatorThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Rodney Sacks for any closing remarks.Rodney Cyril SacksThanks. On behalf of the company, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to innovate, develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad and in particular, capitalizing on our relationship with the Coca-Cola bottling system. We believe that we are well positioned in the beverage industry and continue to be optimistic about the future of our company. We hope that you remain safe and healthy. Thank you very much for your attendance.OperatorThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.]"

The cost of sales of $728.6 million, up 11% year over year. The increase in the cost of sales was mainly attributed to the higher logistics costs, and unfavorable geographical and product sales. Elevated ingredients and other input costs, comprising secondary packaging materials and increased co-packing fees, also hurt the cost of sales.The company’s fourth-quarter 2022 gross margin contracted 210 basis points (bps) to 51.8%, driven by higher ingredient and other input costs, geographical and product sales mix, and elevated logistical costs, offset partly by pricing actions. The metric increased on a sequential basis, driven by pricing actions, as well as recovery in the supply chain.Operating expenses grew 10% year over year to $390 million. The increase can be attributed to higher warehousing and other logistical expenses, elevated payroll expenses, and increased general and administrative expenses.As a percentage of sales, operating expenses rose 90 bps to 25.8%, while the metric contracted 310 bps on a three-year basis. Higher operating expense rates mainly resulted from increased distribution costs, stemming from higher warehousing expenses and other logistical expenses. Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, contracted 30 bps year over year and 270 bps on a three-year basis to 9.6%.Distribution costs, as a percentage of net sales, increased 10 bps to 5% and 150 bps on a three-year basis. General and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, rose 100 bps year over year, while the metric contracted 200 bps on a three-year basis to 11.1%.Operating income of $394.4 million declined 4.5% year over year, driven by a decrease in the gross margin, as well as higher operating expenses. The operating margin contracted 290 bps to 26.1% in the reported quarter.Other FinancialsMonster Beverage ended fourth-quarter 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $1,307.1 million, and total stockholders' equity of $7,025 million.

(NYSE:LUV) Trades Ex-Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/four-days-left-until-southwest-103019528.html,1677753019,STORY,['LUV'],"[It looks like Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) is about to go ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Thus, you can purchase Southwest Airlines' shares before the 7th of March in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 29th of March.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.18 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$0.72 to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that Southwest Airlines has a trailing yield of 2.1% on the current share price of $33.65. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. Check out our latest analysis for Southwest Airlines Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Southwest Airlines paid out just 20% of its profit last year, which we think is conservatively low and leaves plenty of margin for unexpected circumstances.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with shrinking earnings are tricky from a dividend perspective. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. Southwest Airlines's earnings have collapsed faster than Wile E Coyote's schemes to trap the Road Runner; down a tremendous 30% a year over the past five years.Story continuesThe main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, Southwest Airlines has lifted its dividend by approximately 34% a year on average.Final TakeawayFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Southwest Airlines? Southwest Airlines's earnings per share are down over the past five years, although it has the cushion of a low payout ratio, which would suggest a cut to the dividend is relatively unlikely. Southwest Airlines ticks a lot of boxes for us from a dividend perspective, and we think these characteristics should mark the company as deserving of further attention.On that note, you'll want to research what risks Southwest Airlines is facing. Our analysis shows 3 warning signs for Southwest Airlines and you should be aware of them before buying any shares.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. Long term TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 163% in five years. On top of that, the share price is up 21% in about a quarter. The company reported its financial results recently; you can catch up on the latest numbers by reading our company report.So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for TransDigm Group While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, TransDigm Group achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 4.2% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 21% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth. This optimism is visible in its fairly high P/E ratio of 48.07.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that TransDigm Group has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think TransDigm Group will grow revenue in the future.A Dividend LostIt's important to keep in mind that we've been talking about the share price returns, which don't include dividends, while the total shareholder return does. Many would argue the TSR gives a more complete picture of the value a stock brings to its holders. TransDigm Group's TSR over the last 5 years is 202%; better than its share price return. Although the company had to cut dividends, it has paid cash to shareholders in the past.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that TransDigm Group has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 18% in the last twelve months. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 25% per year, is even more impressive. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

The consumer operations largely failed to gain traction against well-established consumer banks and lost billions of dollars due to credit provisioning.Observers have been critical of the bank's foray onto Main Street, which was aimed at diversifying its earnings from the more lucrative mainstays of trading and investment banking.Goldman has not specified what options it's pursuing, but apart from outright asset sales, the bank could also recruit more investors or agree to new partnerships, a senior investment banker, who asked not to be named, said.Those interested could be traditional banks, or Goldman could seek partnerships with certain insurance or private equity shops, the banker said.Goldman Sachs declined to comment beyond what it told investors on Tuesday.Story continuesGoldman shares fell almost 3.8% on Tuesday after the investor gathering. Shares ended down nearly 1% on Wednesday afternoon.""Consumer banking businesses are incredibly hard to build,"" said Chris Kotowski, an analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. ""The incumbent brick-and-mortar banks that everyone thought were dinosaurs actually have a unique and hard to replicate value proposition with checking accounts, cards, a branch near home and one by the office.""Last year, Goldman folded Marcus into its newly formed asset and wealth-management unit. It also created a Platform Solutions unit to house the credit card partnerships, the GreenSky business and transaction banking.While Platform Solutions made up only 3% of Goldman's revenue in 2022, it accounted for about 64% of the $2.72 billion the bank set aside last year for potential credit losses. The firm has also stopped personal loans under the Marcus brand and will probably wind down the $4.5 billion portfolio in the coming months, analysts said.Greensky, a platform for home improvement loans, was acquired by Goldman in March 2022 for $2.24 billion. Spending by homeowners on refurbishing their properties boomed during COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns. However, the tailwinds for that market have started to abate. Lowe's Companies Inc on Wednesday forecast annual sales below expectations amid a decline in the home improvement market, echoing similar commentary from peer Home Depot Inc last week. If Goldman sold GreenSky, it would probably get a much lower price than the $2.2 billion it paid to buy the company last year, said Ebrahim Poonawala, an analyst at Bank of America.But taking a loss on any sale would be offset by an advantage -- removing the distraction of that business, he said. Mike Mayo, an analyst at Wells Fargo, wrote in a note that the key question about Goldman's consumer business is: ""who would be willing to buy it, and at what price?"" Analysts are also skeptical of Goldman's projection that its platforms division would break even on a pre-tax basis by 2025. JPMorgan analysts are projecting a pre-tax loss of $2.4 billion in 2023, $1.7 billion in 2024 and about $800 million in 2025.""We still do not bake in pre-tax profitability in our model, which goes out to 2026,"" Betsy Graseck, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a note.Goldman Sachs said in an email ""we presented our path to reach pre-tax breakeven by 2025 at our Investor Day and we look forward to providing regular updates on our progress.""(Additional reporting by Nupur Anand and David French in New York and Mehnaz Yasmin in Bengaluru; Editing by Lananh Nguyen and Anna Driver)]"

""I live in the same neighborhood as you all live in and I wish the noise was different.""Various media reports of mass partner exits, coupled with recent Wall Street chatter the bank has lost its way after the failure of its consumer banking project Marcus, have all contributed to unfavorable sentiment. And this coming after the company laid off some 3,200 workers' positions, or a little over 6% of its headcount, in January after a challenging 2022.Solomon admitted mistakes were made, telling investors: ""I think we’ve accomplished a lot over the past few years. We got some things right, got some things wrong.""Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon speaks during the Goldman Sachs Investor Day at Goldman Sachs Headquarters in New York City, U.S., February 28, 2023. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid""I read things in the paper that don’t match what’s happening inside the firm,"" Solomon continued, explaining there were fewer partner transitions in 2022 than any other year going back to 2014.""The culture of Goldman Sachs is incredibly strong. ...We have an extraordinary group of people working incredibly hard,"" he said. ""We also recognize we've gone through a very unusual period over the last 3 years — the pandemic was a very tough thing on a culture like ours.""Goldman Sachs shares, down about 5% over the past month, are trading relatively flat year-to-date — underperforming the S&amp;P 500's 3% gain over that same time period.Solomon went on to note Goldman is a ""human business,"" explaining the firm has made conscious decisions to invest in its culture with leadership spending more time with partners throughout the year to help push a greater sense of community throughout the organization.""We’re going to continue to invest in our culture. I think it's very good, [but] I do think we've had dramatic shifts,"" he said, once again referencing the pandemic which was quickly followed by an unfavorable macro environment. ""That created more noise, more grumbling than usual.""Story continuesOverall, ""I feel good about the partnerships [and] the culture, but that doesn't mean we don't have to keep investing,"" he reiterated.Goldman saw a rough end to 2022 with profits down a whopping 69% in Q4 amid a serious decline in deal-making revenues, pressured by a weakening economic backdrop.Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon attends the Goldman Sachs Investor Day at Goldman Sachs Headquarters in New York City, U.S., February 28, 2023. REUTERS/Brendan McDermidFollowing Tuesday's presentation, analyst reaction appeared cautiously optimistic, although questions remain over the path to profitability for its consumer banking unit, otherwise known as platform solutions.Shares of Goldman fell about 4% on Tuesday as the company made its pitch to investors.""Coming out of the conference, the buzz among investors was whether GS will grow the consumer businesses or sell parts of them. Our interpretation of management's commentary is that both options are on the table,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck wrote in a new note published on Wednesday.Graseck maintained her Equal Weight rating and reiterated a 12-month price target of $332 a share.Graseck added all three business segments, which also includes investment banking and trading along with wealth and asset management, ""have an opportunity to contribute to Y/Y EPS growth as GS targets growth opportunities and gets more efficient.""Goldman reported a net loss of $660 million in its platform solutions unit in the fourth quarter with a full-year net loss settling at $1.67 billion. The company blamed the decline on higher provisions for credit losses, but stressed on Tuesday: ""Profitability is not a strategy. It is a priority and the outcome of a strategy well executed.""Bank of America analyst Ebrahim Poonawala told clients Wednesday Goldman's profitability push seemed genuine, writing: ""While investors looking for instant gratification may have been disappointed, we believe that management is on the same page with shareholders in that it appreciates the need to further shrink its consumer exposure ""unlock value"" (specifically, card partnerships and point-of-sale lending).""Poonawala maintained a Buy rating and reiterated a $384 price target on the stock.Alexandra is a Senior Entertainment and Media Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Management has driven the company’s refocused efforts to increase free cash flow and expand profit margins, a task made easier with the cooperating price of oil.

HOLX is gaining from the continued strength of the GYN Surgical and Breast Health businesses. The company’s earnings and revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, stiff competition and currency headwinds do not bode well.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has increased 12.4% compared with the 14.8% fall of the industry and the 9.5% fall of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned medical device company has a market capitalization of $19.63 billion. Its earnings in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 18.9%. Hologic’s long-term expected growth is estimated at 15.2% compared with the industry’s growth expectation of 16.4%.Let’s delve deeper.Factors at PlayQ1 Upsides: Hologic delivered better-than-expected earnings and revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Excluding COVID-related business, Diagnostics grew 15.8% organically, powered by 24.5% growth in Molecular Diagnostics. Surgical also delivered an impressive quarter growing 14.7% organically. While the extra days contributed approximately 250 basis points of net growth, even without the extra days, Diagnostics and Surgical both grew double digits and Breast Health exceeded prior guidance. Hologic is currently well positioned to achieve its full-year guidance of low double-digit organic growth ex-COVID in all three franchises, well above the 5-7% long-term growth rate.Strength in Breast Health: Hologic has been making impressive progress in its Breast Health arm recently. The company is currently focusing on expanding its strategy to diversify the business across the patient continuum of care. It has also launched new software products based on its investments in artificial intelligence and has strengthened its interventional franchise via the Brevera relaunch.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEven though supply-chain challenges persist, demand for the company’s best-in-class Breast Health products remained strong during the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The company anticipates chip supply chain shortage to recover throughout fiscal 2023 and into 2024.Story continuesStrength in GYN Surgical: Over the past few years, the GYN Surgical business has transformed to the most profitable division of Hologic on a percentage basis, banking on new leadership, strong strategic execution of new commercial models and new product launches.Revenues at the GYN Surgical business rose 14.7% year over year organically. These results underscore a more diverse surgical business with more growth drivers than in the past. In addition to strong performance from MyoSure and better-than-expected results from NovaSure, the quarter showcased increasing contributions from Fluent and the company’s laparoscopic portfolio of Asessa and Boulder. Through Acessa and Bolder acquisitions, the company integrated Acessa’s procedure and the Bolder’s advanced vessel sealing portfolio into its product line.DownsidesForeign Exchange Headwinds: We remain worried about the significant challenges Hologic faced owing to unfavorable foreign currency impact that adversely affected the company’s overall performance in the past few quarters.Competitive Landscape: Hologic operates in a highly competitive industry. Its mammography, related products and subsystems compete on a worldwide basis with products offered by several competitors, including General Electric Company (GE), Siemens, Koninklijke Philips NV, or Philips, Planmed Oy, or Planmed, Agfa-Gevaert N.V., or Agfa, Carestream Health, Inc., FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation, or Fuji, I.M.S., and Toshiba Corporation.Estimate TrendIn the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Hologic’s fiscal 2023 earnings has been moved 8.1% north at $3.74.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $3.97 billion, suggesting an 18.4% fall from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksFew other top-ranked stocks in the overall healthcare sector include Haemonetics Corporation HAE, TerrAscend Corp.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at a loss of 9 cents per share.Our TakeMyriad Genetics exited fourth-quarter 2022 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. Hereditary Cancer testing volume registered strong growth in the fourth quarter. GeneSight, within Hereditary Cancer testing, had yet another strong performance with volume improvement. The company ended the reported quarter with no outstanding debt, which is encouraging.On the flip side, significant gross margin contraction and operating loss as a result of mounting cost pressure are concerning. Moreover, the company ended 2022 with lower cash and cash equivalents primarily due to the acquisition of Gateway Genomics (closed November 1) and ongoing capital expenditures and investments in the company's laboratories of the future strategy.Zacks Rank and Key PicksMyriad Genetics currently carries Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Becton, Dickinson and Company BDX, popularly known as BD, McKesson Corporation MCK and Hologic, Inc.

The stock carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Over the past year, Hologic has outperformed its industry. The stock has gained 13.3% against the industry’s 12.9% decline. Hologic delivered better-than-expected earnings and revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2023.GYN Surgical also delivered an impressive quarter, growing 14.7% organically. While the extra days contributed approximately 250 basis points of net growth, even without the extra days, Diagnostics and Surgical both grew double digits and Breast Health exceeded the prior guidance.The GYN Surgical results underscore a more diverse surgical business with more growth drivers than in the past.

Acessa is a unique radio frequency fibroid removal solution forming a new market and improving payer coverage for Hologic. With Boulder, the company is entering an underdeveloped market by deploying its large surgical sales force.Excluding COVID-related business, Diagnostics grew 15.8% organically, powered by 24.5% growth in Molecular Diagnostics. This upside within Molecular Diagnostics reflected the high utilization of the company’s expanded Panther installed base. The uptick in the molecular diagnostics business was broad-based and fueled by a combination of legacy and newer assays in the portfolio. The collective revenues of the company’s core STI menu were well above pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter.Story continuesHologic is currently well positioned to achieve its full-year guidance of low double-digit organic growth ex-COVID in all three franchises, well above the 5% to 7% long-term growth rate.On the flip side, in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, Hologic witnessed a decline in reported revenues compared to the year-ago period. The decline in the top line can be attributed to lower COVID-19 assay sales and supply chain challenges in the Breast Health business. Revenues in the Breast Health segment fell on a year-over-year basis due to the persistent shortage of semiconductor chips. Escalating operating costs and the contraction of both margins are worrying.In the fiscal first quarter, the company-provided adjusted gross margin contracted 1830 basis points (bps) to 31.1%. According to the company, the downside in gross margin was primarily due to a year-over-year decline in COVID-19 assay sales and lower capital equipment sales due to supply chain challenges related to semiconductor chip shortages, which impacted its Breast Health business. The company’s adjusted operating margin was 40.1%, down 1525 bps year over year.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the overall healthcare sector include Haemonetics Corporation HAE, TerrAscend Corp.

And now, the streaming giant hopes the theater audience is equally receptive. Netflix announcing today their first live stage production. ""Stranger Things-- The Play"" will debut in London later this year.Netflix will also produce a live action ""Stranger Things"" spinoff. And that's not all. TMZ reporting Tom Brady will be one of the first in a Netflix series called ""The Greatest Roasts of all Time"" or GROAT, instead of GOAT. Netflix VP of stand up and comedy formats Robbie Praw saying in a statement, quote, ""We can't wait to burn the three time Super Bowl losing quarterback Tom Brady, who only went back to the NFL in order to delay this roast.""So they are doing a lot of things, Seana, outside the box to make that product stickier than it has been in the past. You got to hand it to them for thinking outside the box, for coloring outside the line.SEANA SMITH: Yeah. They certainly are. And a lot of focus on the live content, the push that Netflix has been doing in that area. We've got the live Chris Rock comedy special also coming up this weekend ahead of this year's Oscars. And I bring that up, because there are reports out there that Chris Rock is going to talk about his slap from Will Smith that occurred at the Oscars.He's addressed it, although, briefly over the last year. So he's expected to talk about it in greater length. This is going to be a huge test here for Netflix. The company also will be providing pre and post show programs that are live here to bookend this highly anticipated special. But it makes a lot of sense for Netflix to be pushing into live streaming. And I think they're to get a lot of eyeballs on this one.DAVE BRIGGS: I would be one of those eyeballs. Chris Rock is hilarious. Can't wait to hear how he addresses the slap, quite frankly. And given that it's live, how much will he push the envelope in terms of language, in terms of calling out will Smith. And I'm guessing Will Smith is going to be among that audience, right? Because I think, largely speaking, his re-entry, his reacceptance back into the Oscars and Hollywood community is kind of depending upon how Chris Rock first welcomes him back. So that a lot to watch in this special.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: It would be interesting. I hadn't thought about that, but it makes a lot of sense.DAVE BRIGGS: It'll be a very fascinating night. Can't wait to watch.SEANA SMITH: We are excited to watch that.]"

Stranger Things: The First Shadow will be a prequel of sorts to the supernatural thriller, with many of the same characters.“Expanding our world beyond the TV series is a thrilling experience,” said Matt and Ross Duffer, creators of the show in a press release. “Bringing this new Stranger Things story to the stage, with live audiences, is a prospect that we find enormously exciting, and we are delighted that a city with such a rich theater culture as London will receive the world premiere of our new story. We can’t wait to share it with you.”Set in 1959 in Hawkins, Ind., the primary setting of the show, the play will focus on familiar characters, including future sheriff Jim Hopper, future stressed mother Joyce Byers, ill-fated Bob Newby, and soon-to-be-Vecna Henry Creel.“Hawkins, 1959: a regular town with regular worries,” Netflix said in describing the play’s plot. “Hopper’s car won’t start, Bob’s sister won’t take his radio show seriously, and Joyce just wants to get out as soon as she can. When new student Henry Creel and his family arrive, they find a fresh start isn’t that easy… and the shadows of the past have a very long reach.”The streamer also hints that the play might hold some clues to the final season of the pop-culture-infused show, saying it will “take you right back to the beginning of the Stranger Things story—and to the beginning of the end.”Tickets for the play will go on sale this spring, with more details about a precise premiere date to come. Fans can pre-register for priority access now.

Additional data from Amgen's Center for Observational Research and Amgen funded investigator studies, including YELLOW-III from Mount Sinai will be presented at the American College of Cardiology's 72nd Annual Scientific Session together with World Heart Federation's World Congress of Cardiology (ACC.23/WCC) in New Orleans, LA, March 4-6, 2023.The Repatha data evaluated all primary endpoint events from the patients enrolled in the parent FOURIER study (n=27,564), with a median follow up of 2.2 years, and for patients who received Repatha during FOURIER-OLE (n=6,635), for an additional 3 years of follow up. These findings showed that over the duration of follow-up, patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) who were already receiving statin therapy had a reduction in adverse cardiovasclar outcomes with earlier initiation of Repatha. This was shown by the reduction in total cardiovascular (CV) endpoint events (cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, unstable angina or coronary revascularization) in patients that had initiated Repatha in the parent study and continued Repatha in the OLE, as compared to those who were in the standard of care group in the parent study and only initiated Repatha during the OLE.""Amgen is at the forefront of lipid research and we are focused on addressing some of the most significant cardiovascular disease risk factors, including unmanaged LDL-C and Lp(a),"" said David M. Reese, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen. ""The robust body of evidence on Repatha continues to underscore its clinical importance as a transformative therapy in lowering LDL-C to reduce CV events like heart attack and stroke in patients with ASCVD. We are proud to provide Repatha to millions of patients worldwide at an affordable cost.""Story continuesOlpasiran is an investigational siRNA-based therapy that has been shown to reduce Lp(a) by more than 90% in Phase 2. A new analysis of the OCEAN(a) Dose study will examine whether the percentage of Lp(a) reduction with olpasiran is affected by baseline Lp(a) concentrations. The results showed that olpasiran markedly reduced Lp(a) concentration irrespective of baseline level in those with ASCVD and Lp(a) &gt;150 nmol/L. These findings provide important insights into how much Lp(a) reduction may be achieved with olpasiran in settings where the Lp(a) burden is very high.While in New Orleans, Amgen will also convene the first ever LDL-C Action Summit to address the state of cardiovascular disease (CVD) care in the United States. This first meeting will bring together key CVD community stakeholders, including the American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, Cardio Health Alliance, Baim Institute for Clinical Research and PERFUSE, Family Heart Foundation, National Forum and the National Lipid Association, to understand the challenges in the treatment landscape and discuss strategies and opportunities for collaboratively improving lipid management among the highest risk ASCVD patients.""I look forward to presenting at this important summit convening multiple stakeholders across academia, societies, and industry to address the gaps in ASCVD care,"" said C. Michael Gibson, M.D., CEO of the non-profit Baim Institute of Clinical Research, and Professor of Medicine, Harvard. ""Despite the clear benefits of LDL lowering, people at risk are not being identified, and when they are, they reach the guidelines goal only a third of the time. The implementation science needs to be stepped up to match the amazing basic/clinical science of lipid lowering. We need to work together to get this changed.""For more information on the Amgen abstracts, see below.

Repatha binds to PCSK9 and inhibits circulating PCSK9 from binding to the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR), preventing PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation and permitting LDLR to recycle back to the liver cell surface. By inhibiting the binding of PCSK9 to LDLR, Repatha increases the number of LDLRs available to clear LDL from the blood, thereby lowering LDL-C levels. Repatha has been studied for 12 years in 50 clinical trials with over 51,000 patients.Repatha is approved in more than 75 countries, including the U.S., Japan, Canada and in all 28 countries that are members of the European Union. Applications in other countries are pending.About OlpasiranOlpasiran (formerly known as AMG 890) is a small interfering RNA (siRNA) that targets lipoprotein(a), also known as Lp(a).

Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market.Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment.

126,ee11acbc-7c63-3945-8491-34e2434e7cae,PEG,2023-03-02,PSE&G Proposes Third Phase of Gas System Modernization Program that Strengthens the State's Infrastructure and Sustains Thousands of Jobs,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pse-g-proposes-third-phase-134100400.html,1677678060,STORY,['PEG'],"[Proposal includes plans for introducing renewable natural gas and hydrogen into PSE&amp;G's gas system, supporting a balanced approach to decarbonization NEWARK, N.J., March 1, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- PSE&amp;G today filed for a three-year, $2.54 billion extension of its Gas System Modernization Program (GSMP) with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities. The proposal would continue the utility's work to update its existing infrastructure to improve reliability and reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by replacing aged pipes with modern ones, and sustaining the thousands of jobs and skilled workforce created under GSMP II with the prospect of creating more jobs.Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG) is a publicly traded diversified energy company. Its operating subsidiaries are: PSEG Power, Public Service Electric and Gas Company (PSE&amp;G) and PSEG Long Island. (PRNewsfoto/PSEG)In keeping with its continued efforts to improve reliability and reduce methane emissions, the program's replacement of old gas mains is estimated to reduce CO2e emissions by more than 145,000 metric tons. The proposal also would introduce non-fossil alternatives, renewable natural gas (RNG) and hydrogen, into PSE&amp;G's system. GSMP III would support Governor Murphy's recently announced executive orders to bolster climate adaptation and mitigation efforts, including accelerating the reduction of GHG emissions – especially in overburdened communities that are disproportionately impacted by climate change.GSMP III HighlightsA fast and effective way to curb emissions associated with aging natural gas infrastructure is to accelerate the work started in the first two phases of GSMP, notably:exclusively focusing on modernizing existing infrastructure, using advanced management and construction processes to replace old, leaky cast iron pipes and unprotected steel mains with upgraded materials;maintaining the infrastructure and system through better gas flow control and through upgraded equipment, with the aim of enhancing safety;immediate reduction of leaks by installation of new pipes that can also deliver emerging lower-carbon alternatives, including RNG and hydrogen;an estimated 310 miles, or 38%, of the low-pressure cast iron upgrades would be in municipalities that have a significant number of overburdened communities;enabling higher efficiency appliances; andensuring our customers' power sources remain affordable and diversified.Story continuesEnvironmental AchievementsContinuing GSMP is essential to achieving our aim of reducing methane emissions by 58% from 2011 levels by 2030, and reflects U.S. EPA best management practices for reducing methane emissions from distribution mains and service lines.Through the first two phases of its GSMP program, PSE&amp;G already has reduced methane emissions by nearly a quarter of a million metric tons CO2e from its system compared to 2011 levels. PSE&amp;G has about 3,000 miles of the oldest cast iron mains, with an average age of 91 years, in the country – more than any other American gas utility. GSMP III, which is planned to run from 2024 into 2027, expects to modernize about 860 miles of these cast iron pipes and about 200 miles of unprotected steel pipes.""Investing in our infrastructure to enhance reliability, maintain our safety focus and achieve low carbon goals is a smart strategy and serves both the state's and our customers' interests,"" said Kim Hanemann, president and chief operating officer, PSE&amp;G. ""PSE&amp;G supports a balanced approach to decarbonization while meeting today's energy demand – an approach that recognizes natural gas as a fuel to maintain affordability and reliability, as we continue to assess options including lower-carbon fuels and electrification. To date, this work has avoided methane emissions that equate to removing 54,000 cars from the road. Continuing GSMP, now with new RNG and hydrogen programs, helps keep us Powering Progress.""Renewable Natural GasA proposed RNG facility would inject processed landfill gas into PSE&amp;G's gas distribution system. Compared to the natural gas supply chain, RNG is a less carbon-intense fuel. Our project is estimated to reduce GHG by approximately 27,000 to 36,000 metric tons of CO2e per year. The project would significantly improve regional air quality by reducing air pollutants annually, including tons of nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide. The inclusion of RNG is an important lower-carbon step in the transition to cleaner fuels.""This innovative project builds on the Middlesex County Utilities Authority's continued success in reclaiming landfill gas, and could become a model for others working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,"" said John Wiley, Esq., Middlesex County Utilities Authority chairman of the Board of Commissioners. ""We are proud to enter into this phase of the project with PSE&amp;G; partnerships like this one are consistent with the State of New Jersey's commitment to combat climate change.""Hydrogen PSE&amp;G's plan also includes a 1 MW-rated electrolyzer to supply 2% hydrogen to a part of the gas distribution system for the majority of the year. The electrolyzer would produce approximately 40 lbs/hr of hydrogen. The project would call for a flexible design in anticipation of increased blending in the future. It would reduce an estimated 1,000 metric tons of CO2e annually.GSMP III represents an effective path to maintain and modernize our gas distribution system, reduce methane emissions, and introduce lower-carbon energy into the existing gas infrastructure to meet customer needs and state policies as part of our efforts toward a clean energy future. The RNG and hydrogen projects would help build expertise in the use of alternatives to natural gas. Investments in reliability and decarbonization enhance our customers' experience and help us meet their needs. Recently, customers ranked PSE&amp;G first in the East among large utilities for both gas and electric utility residential customer satisfaction studies according to the J.D. Power 2022 Studies.""We commend PSE&amp;G for its continued commitment in maintaining the resiliency and reliability of the energy system while proactively reducing emissions from the aged pipes,"" said William T. Mullen, president of the New Jersey State Building &amp; Construction Trade Council. ""This next phase of gas modernization program will continue the important work that will produce benefits to families and customers that are relying on the system for their daily needs, and, to the trades that are contributing to the lasting quality of the infrastructure with their skilled work.""Customer NeedNearly two million PSE&amp;G customers depend on natural gas for heat, hot water and cooking. Natural gas has been the most affordable heating option for customers for years. As our state and nation transition to clean energy, natural gas is expected to remain an affordable, reliable service energy source for many customers for decades to come. PSE&amp;G's decarbonization strategy includes aggressively pursuing energy efficiency, exploring alternatives to decarbonize the fuel supply, supporting the electrification of transportation – the state's number one source of GHG emissions – and longer-term exploration of electrification where it makes sense.PSE&amp;G residential gas bills are now approximately 32 percent lower than in 2008, including Feb. 1 and March 1 decreases reflecting lower natural gas supply costs. If implemented as proposed, the program is forecasted to increase a typical residential gas customer bill by about 3 percent or $3 per month for each year of the three-year program.PSE&amp;GPublic Service Electric &amp; Gas Co. is New Jersey's oldest and largest gas and electric delivery public utility, as well as one of the nation's largest utilities. PSE&amp;G is the 2022 Edison Award recipient from the Edison Electric Institute. PSE&amp;G has won the ReliabilityOne® Award for superior electric system reliability in the Mid-Atlantic region for 21 consecutive years. PSE&amp;G received the 2022 ENERGY STAR® ""Partner of the Year"" award in the Energy Efficiency Program Delivery category, and J.D. Power named PSE&amp;G number one in customer satisfaction for both Residential Electric and Natural Gas Service in the East among Large Utilities.

REUTERS/David 'Dee' DelgadoRetailers are feeling the sting of a consumer spending slowdown in an economic environment that's growing more unpredictable. Kohl's, Walmart and Target have all issued cautious outlooks.While inflation in recent months has eased, it remains stubbornly high. And a sustained campaign by the Federal Reserve to cool inflation through interest rate hikes makes it more expensive to use credit cards to buy goods in stores, in addition to raising the cost of auto, home and business loans.Story continuesMacy's said Thursday that it “anticipates that the heightened level of uncertainty within the macroeconomic environment will continue” this year.In early January, Macy's tempered its sales outlook for the fourth quarter based on weak consumer spending leading up to the holiday.It earned $508 million, or $1.83 per share, in the quarter ended Jan. 28. Stripping out certain items, earnings were $1.88 per share. That tops the per-share earnings of $1.57 that Wall Street had expected, according to a survey by Zacks Investment Research.That compares with net income of $742 million, or an adjusted profit of $2.45 per share, in the year-ago period.“Although Macy’s expects challenges in the year ahead (with an net sales decline of 1% to 3% in the fiscal year ahead), its better-than-expected Q4 results bode well as they demonstrate that the myriad changes it has been making over the past few years,” Insider Intelligence senior analyst Zak Stambor.Sales declined to $8.26 billion from $8.67 billion, but that also topped analyst projections. Macy's Inc. said it expects sales of $23.7 billion to $24.2 billion for 2023, which is a bit light of analyst projections.Comparable sales dropped 3.3% on an owned basis and were down 2.7% on an owned-plus-licensed basis.""We were competitive but measured in our promotions, took strategic markdowns and intentionally did not chase unprofitable sales,"" Chairman and CEO Jeff Gennette said in a prepared statement.Best Buy earned $495 million, or $2.23 per share, for the three-month period ended Jan. 28, down from the $626 million it earned during the same period last year, but better than the per-share earnings of $2.10 Wall Street had expected.Revenue declined 10% to $14.73 billion, still slightly better than expected, and comparable store sales fell by the same percentage.The company expects comparable sales to decline anywhere between 3% and 6%, worse than the 1.7% decline expected by industry analysts, according to a poll by FactSet,.Best Buy said Thursday that it expects to earn profits of between $5.70 and $6.50 this year, short of the $6.79 projections on Wall Street.It's revenue projection of between $43.8 billion and $45.2 billion was also shy of the $45.73 billion analysts are looking for.Company shares on Thursday, however, were essentially flat.]"

Comparisons to 2019 are provided, where appropriate, to benchmark performance given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.Diluted earnings per share of $1.83 and Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.88, which includes a $46 million discrete income tax benefit, or $0.17 per share, related to the favorable resolution of a state income tax litigation.This compares to diluted earnings per share of $2.44 and Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.45 in the fourth quarter of 2021.This compares to diluted earnings per share of $1.09 and Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.12 in the fourth quarter of 2019.Net sales of $8.3 billion, down 4.6% versus the fourth quarter of 2021; down 0.9% versus the fourth quarter of 2019.Digital sales decreased 9% versus the fourth quarter of 2021; up 24% versus the fourth quarter of 2019.Brick-and-mortar sales decreased 2% versus the fourth quarter of 2021; down 11% versus the fourth quarter of 2019. The comparison to 2019 is impacted by store closures, including approximately 80 Macy’s full-line stores.Comparable sales down 3.3% on an owned basis and down 2.7% on an owned-plus-licensed basis versus the fourth quarter of 2021; up 3.1% and up 3.3%, respectively, versus the fourth quarter of 2019.Highlights of the company's nameplates include:Macy’s comparable sales were down 3.9% on an owned basis and down 3.3%, on an owned-plus-licensed basis.Performance year-over-year primarily reflects the impacts of macroeconomic pressures on the consumer in conjunction with a lack of government stimulus benefits and a heightened competitive retail environment driven by industry-wide inventory surpluses.Experienced sales strength in gifting and occasion-based categories, including beauty, men’s tailored apparel, dresses and shoes, while sales in active, casual and soft home declined versus the prior year.Bloomingdale’s comparable sales were up 1.2% on an owned basis and up 0.6% on an owned-plus-licensed basis.Beauty, women’s and men’s apparel in both contemporary and dressy performed well partially offset by weakness in handbags and textiles.Bluemercury comparable sales were up 7.2% on an owned basis.Results were driven by strength in skincare and color, strategic partnerships and its new initiative The Cache, an incubator platform that curates the latest undiscovered, emerging, and cutting-edge brands.Gross margin for the quarter was 34.1%, down from 36.5% in the fourth quarter of 2021.Merchandise margin declined largely due to planned markdowns and promotions, which were higher relative to last year, when inventory constraints in the industry led to low promotional levels and robust full-price sell-throughs. The higher level of markdowns and promotions was reflective of both the company’s commitment to end 2022 with inventories at the right level and composition, as well as its response to the competitive retail environment.Delivery expense as a percent of net sales was 60 basis points lower than the prior year due to a 200 basis points decline in digital penetration combined with lower peak delivery surcharges.Selling, general and administrative (""SG&amp;A"") expense of $2.4 billion, a $30 million decrease from the fourth quarter of 2021.SG&amp;A expense as a percent of sales was 29.0%, 100 basis points higher compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 and an improvement of 110 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2019.The company has been investing in its colleagues to remain competitive and attract the best talent, while simultaneously remaining disciplined in its SG&amp;A expense productivity efforts.Net credit card revenue of $262 million, down $2 million.Represented 3.2% of sales, 20 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2021.Performance primarily driven by lower-than-expected bad debt levels and larger balances within the portfolio.Full-Year 2022 HighlightsComparisons are to full-year 2021 unless noted otherwise. Comparisons to 2019 are provided, where appropriate, to benchmark performance given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.Diluted earnings per share of $4.19 and Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.48.This compares to a diluted earnings per share of $4.55 and an Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $5.31 in 2021.This compares to diluted earnings per share of $1.81 and Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.91 in 2019.Net sales of $24.4 billion, down 0.1% versus 2021; down 0.5% versus 2019.Digital sales decreased 6% versus 2021; up 31% versus 2019.Brick-and-mortar sales increased 3% versus 2021; down 11% versus 2019.Comparable sales up 0.3% on an owned basis and up 0.6% on an owned-plus-licensed basis versus 2021; up 3.5% and up 3.7%, respectively, versus 2019.Customer count for the company’s nameplates totaled:42.7 million active customers shopped the Macy’s brand, a 4% decrease compared to the prior year.Star Rewards program members made up approximately 70% of the total Macy's brand owned-plus-licensed sales, up approximately 1 percentage point versus the prior year.4.1 million active customers shopped the Bloomingdale’s brand, a 5% increase compared to the prior year.Strength in luxury coupled with its 150th Anniversary activation and consistent customer engagement supported a banner year for the nameplate.Approximately 662,000 active customers shopped the Bluemercury brand, a 12% increase compared to the prior year.Gross margin for the year was 37.4%, down from 38.9% in 2021.Merchandise margin declined largely due to planned markdowns and promotions, which were higher year-over-year as a result of the impact in the shift of consumer demand from pandemic-related categories like active, casual and soft home to occasion-based categories including dresses, tailored clothing, fragrances and luggage. Elevated industry-wide inventory levels also contributed to a heightened competitive retail landscape.Delivery expense as a percent of net sales decreased 30 basis points from 2021 primarily due to lower digital penetration.Inventory turnover for the year decreased approximately 4% versus 2021 and increased approximately 15% over 2019.Inventory was down approximately 3% and approximately 18% versus 2021 and 2019, respectively.Inventory productivity was driven by a culmination of disciplined inventory management, strategic use of data analytics, the alignment of its merchandising team and the successful integration and modernization of its supply chain.Inventory productivity continues to be a focus for the company in 2023 and beyond.SG&amp;A expense of $8.3 billion, a $270 million increase from 2021.SG&amp;A expense as a percent of sales was 34.0%, 110 basis points higher than 2021 and an improvement of 260 basis points from 2019.The prior year benefited from a significant number of open positions due to the tight labor market. The positions have since largely been filled.Additionally, the company made investments in talent including increasing minimum wage for store and distribution center colleagues and has been adjusting colleague compensation to remain competitive and attract the best talent.Net credit card revenue of $863 million, up $31 million from 2021.Represented 3.5% of sales, 10 basis points higher than 2021.Performance driven by lower-than-expected bad debt levels, larger balances within the portfolio as well as higher-than-expected spend on co-brand credit cards.Financial HighlightsAll amounts in millions except percentages and per share figuresFourth QuarterFull Year2022202120222021Net sales$ 8,264$ 8,665$ 24,442$ 24,460Comparable Sales versus 2021Owned(3.3%)0.3%Owned plus licensed(2.7%)0.6 %Comparable Sales versus 2019Owned3.1%3.5%Owned plus licensed3.3%3.7%Net Income$ 508$ 742$ 1,177$ 1,430Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)$ 887$ 1,232$ 2,568$ 3,194Diluted earnings per share (EPS)$ 1.83$ 2.44$ 4.19$ 4.55Adjusted Net income$ 524$ 745$ 1,259$ 1,668Adjusted EBITDA$ 910$ 1,247$ 2,648$ 3,320Adjusted Diluted EPS$ 1.88$ 2.45$ 4.48$ 5.312023 GuidanceMacy’s, Inc. anticipates that the heightened level of uncertainty within the macroeconomic environment will continue in 2023.

INC.Important Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThe company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users of the company's financial information with additional useful information in evaluating operating performance. Management believes that providing supplemental changes in comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis, which includes adjusting for the impact of comparable sales of departments licensed to third parties, assists in evaluating the company's ability to generate sales growth, whether through owned businesses or departments licensed to third parties, and in evaluating the impact of changes in the manner in which certain departments are operated. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) is a non-GAAP financial measure which the company believes provides meaningful information about its operational efficiency by excluding the impact of changes in tax law and structure, debt levels and capital investment. In addition, management believes that excluding certain items from EBITDA, net income and diluted earnings per share that are not associated with the company’s core operations and that may vary substantially in frequency and magnitude from period-to-period provides useful supplemental measures that assist in evaluating the company's ability to generate earnings and to more readily compare these metrics between past and future periods.The company does not provide reconciliations of the forward-looking non-GAAP measures of adjusted diluted earnings per share and comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures because the timing and amount of excluded items are unreasonably difficult to fully and accurately estimate. For the same reasons, the company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could be material to future results.Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, the company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain of the items that may be excluded or included in non-GAAP financial measures may be significant items that could impact the company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows and should therefore be considered in assessing the company's actual and future financial condition and performance. Additionally, the amounts received by the company on account of sales of departments licensed to third parties are limited to commissions received on such sales. The methods used by the company to calculate its non-GAAP financial measures may differ significantly from methods used by other companies to compute similar measures. As a result, any non-GAAP financial measures presented herein may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies.MACY’S, INC.Important Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures(All amounts in millions except percentages and per share figures)Changes in Comparable Sales - 13 Weeks Ended January 28, 2023Comparable Sales vs. 13 Weeks Ended January 29, 2022Macy’s, Inc.Macy’sBloomingdale’sBluemercuryIncrease (decrease) in comparable sales on an owned basis (Note 4)(3.3)%(3.9)%1.2%7.2%Comparable sales impact of departments licensed to third parties (Note 5)0.6%0.6%(0.6)%—%Increase (decrease) in comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis(2.7)%(3.3)%0.6%7.2%Comparable Sales vs. 13 Weeks EndedFebruary 1, 2020Macy’s, Inc.Increase in comparable sales on an owned basis (Note 4)3.1%Comparable sales impact of departments licensed to third parties (Note 5)0.2%Increase in comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis3.3%Changes in Comparable Sales - 52 Weeks Ended January 28, 2023Comparable Salesvs. 52 Weeks EndedJanuary 29, 2022Comparable Salesvs. 52 Weeks EndedFebruary 1, 2020Macy’s, Inc.Increase in comparable sales on an owned basis (Note 4)0.3%3.5%Comparable sales impact of departments licensed to third parties (Note 5)0.3%0.2%Increase in comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis0.6%3.7%Notes:(4)Represents the period-to-period percentage change in net sales from stores in operation during the 13 and 52 weeks ended January 28, 2023, and the 13 and 52 weeks ended January 29, 2022 and February 1, 2020, respectively.

Definitions and calculations of comparable sales may differ among companies in the retail industry.(5)Represents the impact of including the sales of departments licensed to third parties occurring in stores in operation throughout the year presented and the immediately preceding year and all online sales in the calculation of comparable sales. The company licenses third parties to operate certain departments in its stores and online and receives commissions from these third parties based on a percentage of their net sales. In its financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP, the company includes these commissions (rather than sales of the departments licensed to third parties) in its net sales. The company does not, however, include any amounts in respect of licensed department sales (or any commissions earned on such sales) in its comparable sales in accordance with GAAP (i.e., on an owned basis). The amounts of commissions earned on sales of departments licensed to third parties are not material to its net sales for the periods presented.Non-GAAP financial measures, excluding certain items below, are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure as follows:EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are reconciled to GAAP net income.Adjusted net income is reconciled to GAAP net income.Adjusted diluted earnings per share is reconciled to GAAP diluted earnings per share.EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA13 Weeks EndedJanuary 28, 202313 Weeks EndedJanuary 29, 2022Net income$508$742Interest expense, net3144Federal, state and local income tax expense129240Depreciation and amortization219206EBITDA8871,232Impairment, restructuring and other costs169Settlement charges76Adjusted EBITDA$910$1,24752 Weeks EndedJanuary 28, 202352 Weeks EndedJanuary 29, 2022Net income$1,177$1,430Interest expense, net162255Losses on early retirement of debt31199Federal, state and local income tax expense341436Depreciation and amortization857874EBITDA2,5683,194Impairment, restructuring and other costs4130Settlement charges3996Adjusted EBITDA$2,648$3,320Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share13 Weeks EndedJanuary 28, 202313 Weeks EndedJanuary 29, 202213 Weeks EndedFebruary 1, 2020NetIncomeDilutedEarningsPer ShareNetIncomeDilutedEarningsPer ShareNetIncomeDilutedEarningsPer ShareAs reported$508$1.83$742$2.44$340$1.09Impairment, restructuring and other costs160.0690.033371.08Settlement charges70.0260.02460.15Losses on early retirement of debt————300.10Income tax impact of certain items identified above(7)(0.03)(12)(0.04)(92)(0.30)As adjusted to exclude certain items above$524$1.88$745$2.45$661$2.1252 Weeks EndedJanuary 28, 202352 Weeks EndedJanuary 29, 202252 Weeks EndedFebruary 1, 2020NetIncomeDilutedEarningsPer ShareNetIncomeDilutedEarningsPer ShareNetIncomeDiluted Earnings Per ShareAs reported$1,177$4.19$1,430$4.55$564$1.81Impairment, restructuring and other costs410.15300.103541.13Settlement charges390.14960.31580.19Losses on early retirement of debt310.111990.63300.10Income tax impact of certain items identified above(29)(0.11)(87)(0.28)(100)(0.32)As adjusted to exclude certain items above$1,259$4.48$1,668$5.31$906$2.91View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230302005335/en/ContactsMedia – Chris Grams communications@macys.comInvestors – Pamela Quintiliano investors@macys.com]"

(NYSE:M) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.1654 per share on the 3rd of April. This means the annual payment is 3.1% of the current stock price, which is above the average for the industry. Check out our latest analysis for Macy's Macy's' Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWhile it is great to have a strong dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is sustainable. However, Macy's' earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to fall by 12.9%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio could be 11%, which we consider to be quite comfortable, with most of the company's earnings left over to grow the business in the future.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityThe company's dividend history has been marked by instability, with at least one cut in the last 10 years. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.80 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $0.63. This works out to be a decline of approximately 2.4% per year over that time. A company that decreases its dividend over time generally isn't what we are looking for.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share is growing. Macy's has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 18% per annum. A low payout ratio and decent growth suggests that the company is reinvesting well, and it also has plenty of room to increase the dividend over time.We Really Like Macy's' DividendOverall, we like to see the dividend staying consistent, and we think Macy's might even raise payments in the future. The company is generating plenty of cash, and the earnings also quite easily cover the distributions. We should point out that the earnings are expected to fall over the next 12 months, which won't be a problem if this doesn't become a trend, but could cause some turbulence in the next year. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. To that end, Macy's has 3 warning signs (and 1 which shouldn't be ignored) we think you should know about.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Currently, Collegium Pharmaceutical has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Zoetis has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that COLL is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.COLL currently has a forward P/E ratio of 4.28, while ZTS has a forward P/E of 31.08. We also note that COLL has a PEG ratio of 0.21. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. ZTS currently has a PEG ratio of 2.59.Another notable valuation metric for COLL is its P/B ratio of 4.57. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, ZTS has a P/B of 17.68.Story continuesThese metrics, and several others, help COLL earn a Value grade of A, while ZTS has been given a Value grade of C.COLL is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model.

If you want to see more high growth non-tech stocks that are profitable, go directly to 5 High Growth Non-Tech Stocks That Are Profitable.High growth stocks can have various definitions. For this article, we define high growth as a company where analysts expect the company to grow its EPS by an average annual rate of at least 10% over the next 5 years.High growth stocks can oftentimes be riskier than blue chip stocks because much of their value is in the future and depends on future growth. If high growth stocks' growth rate slows more than expected, the market could value the perceived value in the future lower.Although many high growth stocks are tech stocks, there are also many high growth stocks in other sectors that aren't in technology.Companies try to grow their earnings in various ways. Some companies buy back a lot of their stock to try to generate more EPS growth if their earnings are relatively stable. Other companies try to acquire the right companies for growth. Yet other companies try to expand organically by developing new products or services or expanding into new markets.Sometimes those growth efforts work and sometimes they don't. When they do work, some companies that are successful in making new profitable products, buying back their stock at the right times, and buying the right companies can grow their earnings faster than 10% a year.The Economic CycleAn average company's growth rate can vary depending on where the economy is in the economic cycle. If the economy is strong and growing, the average EPS growth rate might be a little faster than if an economy is weak and potentially contracting.In terms of where the economy is currently in the economic cycle, it isn't clear where the economy is. Although unemployment is low and the economy is growing, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to continue to raise interest rates. If the central bank raises rates too much, there could be an economic slowdown.Story continuesIn 2022, the growth of many high growth stocks in the technology sector slowed fairly considerably in part due to the rise in interest rates. The valuation of many big tech companies decreased as a result of capital moving from the equity market into the U.S. Treasury market given the interest rate increases.Comparatively, many other non-tech sectors did a little better than the tech sector in 2022 because their valuations weren't as high or weren't as dependent on growth rates.If the future increases in interest rates cause a recession or a substantial economic slowdown, however, the valuations in non tech sectors could also come under pressure. An economic slowdown or recession could negatively affect earnings growth rates of companies in both technology and non technology sectors. It could also affect the future expected earnings growth rates for the next 5 years as well.As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.MethodologyFor our list of 16 High Growth Non-Tech Stocks That Are Profitable, we selected 16 stocks with competitive advantages in sectors other than technology that have an EPS next 5 year ratio of over 10% according to FINVIZ.com.EPS Next 5 Year Ratio is the estimated average annual EPS growth rate in the next 5 years.Given EPS Next 5 Year Ratio is an estimate, it can change from time to time depending on economic events, company specific events, and analyst view changes.We ranked the stocks based on their EPS next 5 year ratio according to FINVIZ.com.We also included trailing twelve month net income data from YCharts.Because we used net income data from YCharts, the net income data might not be adjusted and it could be over different time periods since different companies have different fiscal years.For those of you interested, check out 10 High Growth Low Dividend Stocks to Buy.16 High Growth Non-Tech Stocks That Are Profitable16.

(PRNewsFoto/Florida Power &amp; Light Company)The proposal filed with the Florida Public Service Commission would reduce the fuel charge on the typical 1,000-kWh residential customer bill by $4.43 a month, including taxes and fees, from May through December – reflecting a second downward revision in projected natural gas costs for 2023 after last year's high levels.""This is good news for customers,"" said Armando Pimentel, president and CEO of FPL. ""We recognize that sharp inflation is impacting our customers and that every dollar counts which is why we are pleased to provide relief to customers as fuel prices have moderated.""The PSC is considering proposals FPL submitted in January to increase customer bills in April to recover $1.3 billion in incremental restoration costs from Hurricanes Ian and Nicole and $2.1 billion to make up for higher-than-projected natural gas costs in 2022.To partially offset these proposed increases, FPL's January filing also called for decreasing projected 2023 fuel charges by $1 billion due to an expected drop in natural gas prices below original projections. Today's proposal to reduce fuel charges by $379 million is in addition to the earlier $1 billion proposed reduction.Energy independence generates customer savings Even with the increase in natural gas prices in recent years, natural gas remains far more cost-effective than fuel oil and coal to generate electricity. FPL's decision in the early 2000s to seek energy independence and modernize its generating fleet by moving away from foreign oil and constructing ultra fuel-efficient clean energy centers and leading America's largest solar expansion has saved customers more than $14 billion while dramatically reducing carbon emissions.Story continuesIn fact, FPL's solar fleet – the largest in America – doesn't use fuel at all to generate electricity, avoiding about $375 million in fuel costs in 2022 alone. FPL brought 13 solar energy centers online so far this year and will add three more solar plants in 2023 as part of plans to install 90,000 megawatts of solar energy in Florida and massively expand battery storage over the next two decades.FPL offers energy-saving tips to customers  With the bill increase proposed to take effect in April, FPL is encouraging customers to take steps now to lower their bills by monitoring energy use and making their homes more energy efficient. For example:Depending on the season, customers should cool their home at 78° or warmer or heat their home at 68° or cooler. Each degree customers lower or increase the temperature on their thermostat can reduce their bill by 5% a month for heating or cooling costs.Customers can clean the lint filter in their dryer before each load to minimize drying time.Turn off ceiling fans and lights in unoccupied rooms.View daily, weekly and monthly energy use by using the FPL Mobile App, which is available on the Apple App store, Google Play or by texting ""App"" to MyFPL (69375).Customers can activate the free FPL Energy Manager tool to monitor how their home is using energy and identify ways to save.For more helpful tips, customers can visit FPL.com/waystosave.Florida Power &amp; Light Company   As America's largest electric utility, Florida Power &amp; Light Company serves more customers and sells more power than any other utility, providing clean, affordable, reliable electricity to approximately 5.8 million accounts, or more than 12 million people.

PAUL, Minn., March 02, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Patterson Companies, Inc. (Nasdaq: PDCO) today reported consolidated net sales of $1.60 billion (see attached Sales Summary for further details) in its fiscal third quarter ended January 28, 2023, an increase of 0.3 percent compared to the same period last year. Internal sales, which are adjusted for the effects of currency translation and contributions from recent acquisitions, increased 1.8 percent over the prior year period.Reported net income attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc. for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 was $53.9 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, compared to $57.0 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. The year-over-year decrease in reported net income attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc. is related to an investment gain in the prior year period. Adjusted net income1 attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc., which excludes deal amortization and gains on investments, totaled $61.1 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2023, or $0.62 per diluted share, compared to $54.2 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. The year-over-year increase in adjusted net income attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc. in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 is primarily due to operating margin expansion in both business segments.""Our team continued to successfully execute during the third quarter and create value for both our customers and shareholders,"" said Don Zurbay, President and CEO of Patterson Companies. ""In addition to sales growth as a result of our strong value proposition to customers, our strategic focus on operational excellence, improved mix and disciplined expense management helped drive operating margin expansion for the business and within both segments during the fiscal third quarter. Our guidance reflects confidence in our ability to achieve our goals to deliver year-over-year internal sales growth and adjusted operating margin expansion in fiscal 2023.""Story continuesPatterson DentalReported net sales in the Dental segment for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 were $621.8 million. Internal sales decreased 3.8 percent compared to the fiscal 2022 third quarter. Internal sales of consumables declined 1.5 percent year-over-year primarily due to the continued moderation of infection control products compared to the pandemic-related performance in the year-ago period. Excluding infection control products, internal sales of consumables increased 4.6 percent year-over-year. Compared to the prior year period, internal sales of equipment decreased 9.7 percent driven by a decline in digital and CAD/CAM technology products. Internal sales of value-added services increased 4.5 percent.Patterson Animal HealthReported net sales in the Animal Health segment for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 were $969.4 million. Internal sales growth of 4.6 percent year-over-year was driven by sales growth in both companion animal and production animal. Within the Animal Health segment, internal sales of consumables grew 4.4 percent, equipment and software increased 2.8 percent and value-added services increased 31.0 percent compared to the prior year period.Balance Sheet and Capital AllocationDuring the first nine months of fiscal 2023, Patterson Companies used $728.2 million of cash from operating activities and collected deferred purchase price receivables of $758.0 million, generating $29.8 million in cash, compared to generating $84.2 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow1 (see definition below and attached free cash flow table) during the first nine months of fiscal 2023 declined by $70.4 million compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2022 due to an increased level of working capital during the first nine months of fiscal 2023.In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, Patterson Companies declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per share and returned $25.2 million in cash dividends to shareholders. Through the first nine months of fiscal 2023, Patterson Companies has returned $91.0 million to shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases.Year-to-Date ResultsConsolidated reported net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2023 totaled $4.8 billion, a 2.3 percent year-over-year decrease. Sales in the first nine months of fiscal 2022 reflected an extra week of sales results in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Internal sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2023, which are adjusted for the effects of currency translation, the extra week of selling results in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and contributions from recent acquisitions, increased 1.8 percent year-over-year. Through the first nine months of fiscal 2023, Dental segment internal sales decreased 1.1 percent, including a 3.1 percent decline in consumables, a 0.2 percent decline in equipment and software and a 6.2 percent increase in value added services. Through the first nine months of fiscal 2023, Animal Health segment internal sales increased 3.5 percent, including 3.3 percent growth in consumables, 3.7 percent growth in equipment and software and a 15.0 percent increase in value added services.Reported net income attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc. for the first nine months of fiscal 2023 was $132.6 million, or $1.35 per diluted share, compared to $139.3 million, or $1.42 per diluted share in last year's period. Adjusted net income1 attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc., which excludes deal amortization, integration and business restructuring expenses, legal reserves, inventory donation charges and gains on investments totaled $154.0 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2023, or $1.57 per diluted share, compared to $153.3 million, or $1.56 per diluted share, in the year-ago period.Fiscal 2023 GuidancePatterson Companies today narrowed its fiscal 2023 earnings guidance, which is provided on both a GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted1 basis:GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.96 to $2.01 per diluted share.Non-GAAP adjusted earnings1 are expected to be in the range of $2.25 to $2.30 per diluted share.Our non-GAAP adjusted earnings1 guidance excludes the after-tax impact of:Deal amortization expenses of approximately $29.2 million ($0.29 per diluted share).Our guidance reflects the strength of our business and competitive positioning, as well as our expectations for the North American and international end markets in which we operate, which we expect to be affected by the ongoing challenges of inflationary trends and higher interest rates as well as a potential slow-down in the broader economy. Beyond macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, our guidance further assumes that there are no material adverse developments associated with the pandemic.1Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThe Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP Measures table appearing behind the accompanying financial information is provided to adjust reported GAAP measures, namely operating income, other income (expense), net income before taxes, income tax expense, net income, net income attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc. and diluted earnings per share attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc., for the impact of deal amortization, integration and business restructuring expenses, legal reserves, inventory donation charges and gains on investments along with the related tax effects of these items.The term ""free cash flow"" used in this release is defined as net cash used in operating activities less capital expenditures plus the collection of deferred purchase price receivables.In addition, the term ""internal sales"" used in this release represents net sales adjusted to exclude the impact of foreign currency, the extra week of selling results in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and the impact from recent acquisitions. Foreign currency impact represents the difference in results that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates the company uses to convert results for all foreign entities where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. The company calculates the impact as the difference between the current period results translated using the current period currency exchange rates and using the comparable prior period's currency exchange rates. The company believes the disclosure of net sales changes in constant currency provides useful supplementary information to investors in light of fluctuations in currency rates.Management believes that these non-GAAP measures may provide a helpful representation of the company's third quarter performance and enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely for informational and comparative purposes and should not be regarded as a replacement for corresponding, similarly captioned, GAAP measures.Third Quarter Conference Call and ReplayPatterson Companies’ fiscal 2023 third quarter conference call will start at 8:30 a.m. Eastern today.

The solution is ideal for:Business content providers, such as publishers, journalists, market analysts, etc., and document platforms, such as VDRs, CMSs and eDiscovery tools, who want to make content more organized and discoverable;Professional services providers, such as consultants, expert networks, system integrators, etc., who can use it to discover new actionable insights or build end-user solutions; andFinance professionals who want to find market signals from thousands of documents without reading them, such as asset managers, equity researchers, quants, etc.""Classify capabilities are unprecedented, only requiring 30 data points to learn a new concept with three minutes of training time,"" said Philip Taylor, Lead Product Manager at Kensho Technologies. ""Classify is more accurate, faster, can handle larger payloads, and is easier to use than any other product on the market today.

If you want to see more high growth non-tech stocks that are profitable, go directly to 5 High Growth Non-Tech Stocks That Are Profitable.High growth stocks can have various definitions. For this article, we define high growth as a company where analysts expect the company to grow its EPS by an average annual rate of at least 10% over the next 5 years.High growth stocks can oftentimes be riskier than blue chip stocks because much of their value is in the future and depends on future growth. If high growth stocks' growth rate slows more than expected, the market could value the perceived value in the future lower.Although many high growth stocks are tech stocks, there are also many high growth stocks in other sectors that aren't in technology.Companies try to grow their earnings in various ways. Some companies buy back a lot of their stock to try to generate more EPS growth if their earnings are relatively stable. Other companies try to acquire the right companies for growth. Yet other companies try to expand organically by developing new products or services or expanding into new markets.Sometimes those growth efforts work and sometimes they don't. When they do work, some companies that are successful in making new profitable products, buying back their stock at the right times, and buying the right companies can grow their earnings faster than 10% a year.The Economic CycleAn average company's growth rate can vary depending on where the economy is in the economic cycle. If the economy is strong and growing, the average EPS growth rate might be a little faster than if an economy is weak and potentially contracting.In terms of where the economy is currently in the economic cycle, it isn't clear where the economy is. Although unemployment is low and the economy is growing, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to continue to raise interest rates. If the central bank raises rates too much, there could be an economic slowdown.Story continuesIn 2022, the growth of many high growth stocks in the technology sector slowed fairly considerably in part due to the rise in interest rates. The valuation of many big tech companies decreased as a result of capital moving from the equity market into the U.S. Treasury market given the interest rate increases.Comparatively, many other non-tech sectors did a little better than the tech sector in 2022 because their valuations weren't as high or weren't as dependent on growth rates.If the future increases in interest rates cause a recession or a substantial economic slowdown, however, the valuations in non tech sectors could also come under pressure. An economic slowdown or recession could negatively affect earnings growth rates of companies in both technology and non technology sectors. It could also affect the future expected earnings growth rates for the next 5 years as well.As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.MethodologyFor our list of 16 High Growth Non-Tech Stocks That Are Profitable, we selected 16 stocks with competitive advantages in sectors other than technology that have an EPS next 5 year ratio of over 10% according to FINVIZ.com.EPS Next 5 Year Ratio is the estimated average annual EPS growth rate in the next 5 years.Given EPS Next 5 Year Ratio is an estimate, it can change from time to time depending on economic events, company specific events, and analyst view changes.We ranked the stocks based on their EPS next 5 year ratio according to FINVIZ.com.We also included trailing twelve month net income data from YCharts.Because we used net income data from YCharts, the net income data might not be adjusted and it could be over different time periods since different companies have different fiscal years.For those of you interested, check out 10 High Growth Low Dividend Stocks to Buy.16 High Growth Non-Tech Stocks That Are Profitable16.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Motley Fool's 5 High Growth Stock Picks. According to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. strategists, the significant outperformance of cheaper, value stocks over growth stocks from the previous year is expected to reverse soon as the pace of economic recovery slows down. The value trade, which was a popular investment strategy in 2022, is beginning to lose its appeal. As a result, JPMorgan’s team led by Mislav Matejka suggested that investors may need to consider reducing their exposure to value stocks compared to growth stocks in the next one or two months. They recommend going ""outright underweight value versus growth,"" as stated in a note. Mislav Matejka further wrote in a note: “Our core view is that in the second half, market will be moving back to the recession trade, but even if the opposite scenario gains traction, value might not be the best place to be.”After significantly outperforming growth stocks last year by the largest margin since the dotcom bubble in 2000, the performance of value stocks has begun to slow down in comparison. Although value stocks received a boost from rising bond yields and inflation, investors are becoming more cautious due to concerns about a potential hawkish policy. This may lead to a decrease in support for the value trade as bond yields reach their peak. The current pace of economic activity is likely to reach its peak and could start to decline soon. Additionally, the stall in inflation expectations implies that the value factor may not perform as well relative to growth in the future.Motley Fool Asset Management prioritizes investing in high-quality companies with strong growth potential.

Payment volume grew 21% in local currency (excluding Russia) as consumer spending remained resilient and the international travel recovery continued as border restrictions were lifted. We continue to own the stock due to Mastercard’s long runway for growth and significant competitive advantages.”9. Paylocity Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:PCTY)3-year Revenue Growth: 51.8%Paylocity Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:PCTY) provides cloud-based human capital management and payroll software solutions in the United States. In Q4 2022, Motley Fool reported owning 48,442 shares of Paylocity Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:PCTY) worth $9.4 million. It is one of the firm’s top high growth stock picks. On February 2, Paylocity Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:PCTY) reported a Q2 non-GAAP EPS of $1.12, beating market estimates by $0.38. Revenue for the period increased 39.3% year-over-year to $273 million, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $13.32 million. Bryan Bergin, an analyst at Cowen, increased the price target for Paylocity Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:PCTY) on February 3 from $231 to $265 and maintained an Outperform rating on the shares.

The company’s cloud-based human capital management and payroll software solutions help businesses manage through broad labor shortages and provide solutions to retain talent. However, as excess slack in the labor market has begun to be absorbed, investments in human resources solutions have declined. Additionally, we believe Paylocity continues to have a compelling long-term growth runway as it attracts new customers and gains market share against large, mature competitors.”8. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)3-year Revenue Growth: 54.9%Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is a California-based customer relationship management technology firm. It is one of Motley Fool’s top high growth stock picks. The hedge fund raised its stake in Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) by 209% in the fourth quarter of 2022, holding 70,533 shares worth $9.35 million. As of March 1, Wall Street analysts expect Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) to report a profit, excluding one-time items, of $1.36 per share, on revenue of $7.99 billion. During the prior-year quarter, the company earned 84 cents a share, on $7.33 billion in revenue.On February 24, BMO Capital analyst Keith Bachman raised the firm's price target on Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) to $185 from $172 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares ahead of its earnings. According to the analyst's research note, continued strong margins may be a significant factor in driving the stock higher as growth stabilizes at a high-single-digit rate. Additionally, the firm believes that Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)’s large size gives it an advantage over other SaaS vendors in terms of brand recognition, sales, and cost management.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 117 hedge funds were bullish on Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), and Harris Associates held the largest stake in the company, with 8.14 million shares worth $1 billion. Aristotle Atlantic made the following comment about Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We sold Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) to reduce our weighting in the Information Technology sector. Salesforce held their investor day, and the company reiterated their organic Fiscal Year 2026 revenue target of $50 billion. This target remains more back-end loaded based on current slowing macroeconomic conditions and requires new annual contract growth well ahead of what the company has been averaging for the past few years. We are skeptical that the company will be able to achieve this revenue target organically and see Merger &amp; Acquisitions (M&amp;A) being key to achieving the growth. While we believe Salesforce has shown good success in growing its non-CRM clouds, we do see more competitive pressures emerging for the Marketing and Customer Service Clouds, specifically on the pricing side during a global economic slowdown.”7. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)3-year Revenue Growth: 55.0%Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the top high growth stocks in Motley Fool Asset Management’s Q4 portfolio. The hedge fund owns 448,001 shares of the tech giant, worth nearly $40 million and representing 4.48% of the total 13F securities. The average 3-year revenue growth for Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) between 2020 and 2022 came in at 55%. On February 9, Wells Fargo analyst Brian Fitzgerald noted that the Bard rollout has been disappointing. However, there is an opportunity for investment in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) due to the excitement around Generation Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI), which has potential for deployment without disrupting search monetization. Additionally, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a leader in conversational AI technology and there is a misunderstanding of what drives search share. As a result, the firm recommends purchasing Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares, assigning the stock an Overweight rating and a target price of $150.According to Insider Monkey’s Q4 data, 152 hedge funds were bullish on Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), compared to 156 funds in the prior quarter. Chris Hohn’s TCI Fund Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 54.5 million shares worth $4.8 billion. Diamond Hill Large Cap Strategy made the following comment about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Other bottom contributors included media and technology giant Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), apparel and footwear company V.F. Corporation and utility operator Dominion Energy. We believe Alphabet’s shares underperformed on concerns of a weakening macroeconomic environment. The company also reported weaker-than-expected earnings and revenue for Q3 2022. Longer-term, we expect Alphabet’s search engine advertising, YouTube advertising and other initiatives to continue driving revenue growth. As such, we used the share price weakness this quarter to add to our position.”6. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)3-year Revenue Growth: 61.7%NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a California-based provider of graphics, semiconductors, and networking solutions in the United States, Taiwan, China, and internationally. In the fourth quarter of 2022, Motley Fool held 54,758 shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) worth $8 million, representing 0.9% of the total securities. It is one of the premier high growth stock picks of the hedge fund. During Nvidia's fourth-quarter earnings report, CEO Jensen Huang openly expressed his belief in the significant role that artificial intelligence will play in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s future. Huang stated that the AI market has reached a turning point and that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is currently the main operating system for AI systems.On February 23, C.J. Muse, an analyst at Evercore ISI, increased the price target on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) from $245 to $300 while maintaining an Outperform rating on the shares. This decision comes after NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) beat expectations for the January quarter and provided an even more positive outlook for the April quarter. The firm expects data center revenues to accelerate throughout the entirety of 2023, which should be positively received given concerns about decelerating data center demand and the potential for a total revenue guide down for April, the analyst wrote in a research note. According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 106 hedge funds were long NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), compared to 89 funds in the earlier quarter. Like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Atlassian Corporation (NASDAQ:TEAM), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Motley Fool’s high growth stock picks include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). O’keefe Stevens Advisory made the following comment about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“The market and our portfolios had a challenging year as interest rates rose, and deteriorating fundamentals cut our largest position, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), in half. Since our initial purchase in 2013, NVDA has seen its stock decline 50% one other time, back in 2018. The best-performing businesses and stocks do not go up and to the right. Mr. Market gets moody, and even one of the highest quality companies in the world is not immune. Drawdowns of this magnitude are challenging to stomach, even though the stock is up 50x in less than ten years. While we consider ourselves old school value investors, we continue to hold this fantastic company even though, optically, it does not appear cheap. Our confidence in Jensen remains, and while gaming is no longer in hyper-growth mode, the Data Center segment continues to grow. AI, Automotive, and other small but rapidly growing industries are the next leg of the story. Chris Mayer discusses the position in greater detail with commentary from our CIO, Peter O’Keefe.

Elon Found His Next Shiny Object.Israel’s Window to Strike Iran Narrows as Putin Enters EquationHow to Get a Free Flight to Hong Kong in 500,000 Airline Ticket GiveawayNewmont Corp.’s $17 billion pursuit of Newcrest Mining Ltd. underscores the gold industry’s appetite for consolidation. Diversified miners including BHP Group Ltd., Glencore Plc and Rio Tinto Group are also signaling renewed interested in takeovers, which makes the Prospectors &amp; Developers Association of Canada gathering fertile ground for deals.That’s the backdrop for the thousands of mining executives, investors, bankers and government officials converging on the Canadian city over the next week to attend one of the industry’s largest events. Mergers and acquisitions will be top of mind just as project pipelines shrink and companies face increasing pressure to buy growth. Even smaller precious metals explorers and producers are drawing interest.“There’s some really attractive prices out there right now from a standpoint of putting companies together,” Canadian entrepreneur Rob McEwen, who founded Goldcorp and now leads McEwen Mining Inc., said in an interview ahead of the conference.Newmont’s proposal to buy Newcrest in early February — the biggest gold mining takeover ever, if it happens — set the tone for M&amp;A this year. That one deal accounts for a lion’s share of the $28 billion in announced mining takeovers tracked by Bloomberg in the first quarter. While the number of deals in the first quarter is down from last year, there’s good reason to think activity could gather steam as executives meet at PDAC starting Sunday.“The majority of our members are small- to medium- sized companies, and the M&amp;A in that space has not been particularly big recently,” PDAC President Alex Christopher said in an interview. “Clearly a lot of them look to M&amp;A for growth, though. They’re often trying to discover assets that a bigger company would later take on.”Story continuesSuch is the case with Sabina Gold &amp; Silver Corp., the Vancouver-based explorer that agreed to a C$1.1 billion ($809 million) takeover by B2Gold Corp. last month. Companies are also seeking to bulk up on battery metals amid a global shift from fossil fuels to the copper, nickel and lithium needed to power an energy transition. Teck Resources Ltd. is pivoting in that direction, after the Vancouver-based miner said in February that it’ll spin off its steelmaking coal unit to focus more on copper.Automakers have even started investing in the producers of raw materials they need, a rare move for an industry that doesn’t typically venture down the supply chain. Stellantis NV just took 14% of McEwen Copper. General Motors Co. is competing for a stake in Vale SA’s base metals unit following its $650 million pact with Lithium Americas Corp.

How do you describe your job to people?At the end of the day, I look at the role I have as chief product officer as being about helping to fulfill our mission around powering economies and empowering people, by creating payment products that meet the needs of consumers and businesses, that are convenient and safe and secure to use, that are ubiquitous in their availability and application. And a lot of that revolves around continuing to deliver great card products in the debit and credit space, which has obviously been core to our business for many, many years.But it's also about enabling a much broader degree of choice than you might typically associate with Mastercard, given our close connection with debit and credit cards—enabling choice in the form of different kinds of payments, real-time payments, account-to-account payments, push payments, blockchain-enabled payments. Cards represent a tremendous value proposition, and we still see them as a great growth opportunity. But cards aren't fit for purpose for every kind of transaction.I have a related question: On a scale of one to 10, how annoying is it when people call Mastercard a “credit card company” and not a “payment processor”?(Laughs) I won't give you a hard number—because I'm afraid you'll hold me to it—but, yeah, it’s an understandable thing because of our longstanding association with credit cards and debit cards. But we're not a credit card company. We're a technology company, primarily the application of technologies in the payment space. There's so much more to us than just credit cards.Story continuesWhat’s something else Mastercard is doing in terms of blockchain or crypto that many people don’t know about? Orsomething that’s misunderstood?I see us sort of at this interesting juncture in history where we're sort of sitting at this confluence—sort of this inexorable migration towards digitization—the introduction of new technologies of which blockchain is one. But also other kinds of new technologies, whether that's devices that we as consumers engage and interact with, or it's a different sort of payment-related technology, creating a whole new wave of consumer experiences.As an example of that, the trend towards digitization has enabled an upside, that of creating this incredible expanding array of use cases where payments play a role. And electronic digital payments, in particular, have also introduced new risks into the payment ecosystem, because digitized credentials are easy to move around. And when they're moving around, and they're residing in lots of different places, it's easier to compromise them, steal them, and use them for the wrong thing. That, for us, has led to innovations around creating token technology, and encrypting those credentials in ways that they're secure.And just to be totally clear, are those things on a blockchain now, or might some of them be soon?All of the examples that I mentioned aren't necessarily on the blockchain, but blockchain becomes a really interesting and potentially valuable technology to enhance the value of some of these same kinds of transactions. So I talked a little bit, for example, about cross-border payments and remittances. This is a perfect example where there is an existing way to move money across borders—send money to a family member, for example, overseas—but we all know that it's rife with inefficiency. It can be slow, it can be costly, it's hard to know sometimes exactly how much it's going to cost, how much is going to get there, when it’s going to get there.We've been experimenting with blockchain for use cases like that, to make that kind of process much more efficient. Similarly, with B2B payments, as another example of another area that's pretty inefficient, blockchain technology can add a lot of value, not just in terms of speed and transport transparency, but also the programmability of a payment that resides on the blockchain. Now, these are areas where we're not at scale today, but they are areas where we're experimenting because we see the promise and the potential of that technology.You mentioned scalability, and for many things in the crypto ecosystem that's kind of been an issue—it’s too quick with not enough safeguards, or it's just kind of lagging—so what are realistic time horizons for established firms like yours?In the evolution of crypto timeframes, roles and responsibilities are going to largely be a function of what is an evolving regulatory environment. That is, we think, a much-needed regulatory environment. Something we've been engaged with regulators and policymakers to try to influence and educate and create awareness around, in part, is the distinction between crypto as an asset class and crypto as a payment instrument.We don't have a view on the asset class—just like we don't on commodities or securities or any other asset class—but to the extent consumers want to buy and sell, we want our products and our network to be in a position to easily and securely facilitate that movement of money into and out of fiat currency and crypto, and vice versa. We are also working with partners to make buying, selling, holding cryptocurrencies more broadly available through financial institution partners. That's the kind of thing we're looking at, while also investing in things to enhance trust and security, and reduce risk.Maybe some examples?It's CBDCs. It's stablecoins. It's tokenized bank deposits. Deposits sort of adhere to our standards around stability of value—with a payments instrument, you have to have some idea of what the currency is actually going to be worth when the counterparties agree on an exchange. And what happens in the case where something goes wrong with a transaction, their dispute rights, is there a chargeback process, regulatory compliance?So, knowing that, and much more broadly, what’s the future of crypto when it comes to Mastercard?Crypto’s future is going to hinge on a couple of very important factors. One that we've already touched on is the regulatory environment, and establishing clear rules of the road and guidelines for all participants, whether we're talking about crypto as an asset class or as a payments instrument.The second is, we believe for crypto to achieve mainstream adoption—in use cases related to payments—there needs to be a clear framework for creating trust around the transactions. This includes clear consumer protections—what happens when something goes wrong, a better means of authenticating individual identities. Likewise, it means ensuring it’s not being used for money laundering or other kinds of negative uses.And, ultimately, there needs to be a degree of interoperability between different currencies, cryptocurrencies, so that it increases the utility of those individual currencies to be able to be used anywhere. All of those things are going to be important, I think, to having crypto evolve beyond being the realm of the enthusiasts into more mainstream adoption and commercial applications.Even more broadly: What do you see as the future of finance? Like 50 years ago, people weren’t going to an ATM, we didn’t have autopay, etc. What’s next?(Laughs) I wish I could predict that—what the next ATM equivalent 20 or 30 years from now would be. But I can’t. It's hard to say exactly what it's going to be, with so much happening in terms of new technology. But my view is, it's going to involve more choice. For consumers, it's going to be more digital, it's probably going to have, on the surface, a simpler sort of user experience but more complexity behind the scenes.And so, with those things in mind—choice, digitization, increasing complexities—the one thing I think that’s not going to change is the need for trust. And that applies to anything of value, whether that’s money in the form of payment or the purchase or sale of an NFT.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeHow to save $750 a month, according to financial advisersThe 10 best high yield savings accounts for March 2023This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home]"

How Beijing chooses to support the recovery at its upcoming annual policy meeting will now be the focus of markets from copper to crude and soybeans.Most Read from BloombergSorry, Twitter. Elon Found His Next Shiny Object.How to Get a Free Flight to Hong Kong in 500,000 Airline Ticket GiveawayWorld’s Rich Take Advantage as $1 Trillion Property Market CratersIsrael’s Window to Strike Iran Narrows as Putin Enters EquationChina’s reopening, and the policy measures that accompany it, are likely to raise demand and prices across a raft of raw materials after the final throes of Covid Zero caused consumption to nosedive last year. But the nature of that support could be crucial to sorting out which markets win most from the government’s renewed focus on economic growth.The population’s newfound freedom has buoyed sentiment around commodities like oil and fuels, which are keyed to improved mobility after years of lockdowns and transport restrictions. In contrast, metals and power markets have been slower to see the benefits after the Lunar New Year holiday in January dented industrial activity.President Xi Jinping has made lifting domestic demand a priority. That could signal less emphasis at the National People’s Congress, which begins on Sunday, on Beijing’s usual means of boosting the economy via infrastructure investment. The unexpectedly robust revival in factory activity in February could also douse expectations that the government needs to raise direct spending to keep the economy on track.If policymakers opt to favor consumption, perhaps via measures to expand credit, then markets for items such as crude, gasoline and derivative products like plastics will reap the reward. Although more spending on consumer goods like cars and appliances will lift metals usage, it’s unlikely to offset the much bigger demand from the airports, railways and bridges that China has built in the past.Story continuesDespite the mounting strain on government finances, Beijing can’t ignore infrastructure spending because so much of the economy, which includes the world’s biggest steel, cement and aluminum industries, is geared toward construction. And many of these firms are state-owned.UBS Global Wealth Management thinks the Congress will set China’s growth target this year at 5% or more, after the economy grew just 3% in 2022. To support that, it expects local government bond sales, the backbone of infrastructure investment, to be at least as high as last year’s 3.65 trillion yuan ($530 billion).But the type of investment is changing, particularly in light of the climate emergency. That means more solar farms, power storage facilities and expansions of the grid are on the cards, perhaps using less steel and cement but requiring more materials like copper and aluminum that are deemed critical to the energy transition.The beleaguered property market also remains crucial as a source of commodities demand, mainly in terms of building materials but also the purchases that often accompany a new home. So any further measures to shore up that sector will be closely watched.“The NPC is expected to stimulate both consumption and infrastructure,” said Wei Lai, an analyst with Zijin Tianfeng Futures Co. “If it can also soften its tone on curbing the property sector, or stress its support for private enterprises, that would be something beyond expectations.”The Week’s Diary(All times Beijing unless noted.)Thursday, March 2Last day of Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko’s visit to ChinaChina Carbon Neutral Summit in Shanghai, day 1EARNINGS: Yunnan Energy New MaterialFriday, March 3Caixin’s China services &amp; composite PMIs for February, 09:45China weekly iron ore port stockpilesShanghai exchange weekly commodities inventory, ~15:30China Carbon Neutral Summit in Shanghai, day 2Saturday, March 4Nothing major scheduledSunday, March 5National People’s Congress begins in BeijingOn The WireRussia’s top miner, MMC Norilsk Nickel PJSC, is selling some of its metal in yuan at prices set in Shanghai, a sign of how the invasion of Ukraine is redrawing global commodity flows and handing greater power to China.--With assistance from Sarah Chen and Kathy Chen.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekMicrosoft Expands Game Pass as Regulators Fret Over Activision DealFBI Documents Show Leonardo DiCaprio, Kim Kardashian Grilled for 1MDB SecretsRussian Airlines Are Flying High Despite SanctionsGina Raimondo Becomes China Player in a Job Where Her Predecessor Used to NapFemale Execs Are Exhausted, Frustrated and Heading for the Exits©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Others have pushed for the first woman president in the bank's 77-year history.The World Bank declined to comment on Banga's meetings since the nominating process continues through March 29, and other candidates could still be put forth by other member countries.So far, no other nominations have been made, said one of the sources.

Turns out, Qualcomm expects that it won’t be supplying Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) with modem chips in 2024.The decision isn’t written in stone, as Qualcomm’s CEO, Cristian Amon, remarked that it was “…their decision to make.” Nevertheless, Amon doesn’t look for Qualcomm to produce such chips for Apple any longer. Why? Because Apple may finally be in a position to make its own mobile modem chips. This comes after reports back in June noted that Qualcomm would likely continue to supply such chips for the iPhone 16. Those reports came from TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.Qualcomm and Apple have had their difficulties in the past. Originally, Qualcomm would sell Apple a chip but then immediately demand patent royalties for the tech used within the chip Apple just bought. Apple, not surprisingly, objected to this notion. In addition, Qualcomm has accused Apple of blackmail, and lawsuits followed. Apple, seemingly interested in dropping Qualcomm for good, then bought Intel’s (NASDAQ:INTC) modem division in a bid to build its own chips.Despite this potential major loss of business, Wall Street is still bullish on Qualcomm stock. Indeed, analyst consensus calls it a Moderate Buy with an average price target of $146.06, which implies 17.99% upside potential.Disclosure]"

The company saw its percentage of women in tech jobs rise in 2022. Booking.comWhat percentage of tech employees at Booking Holdings are women? How has the company’s total return compared over the last five years to its internet peers? Booking detailed information about these issues and others in a half dozen charts in its recent annual financial disclosure.Three Online Travel Agencies That Do A Lot of the Same ThingsBooking Holdings’ six major brands offer the following key services:Source: Booking HoldingsThe three online travel agency brands, Booking.com in Amsterdam, Priceline in the U.S., and Agoda in Singapore, offer essentially the same main services — accommodations, ground transportation, flights and activities.There are at least three important points about the chart. As a rule, none of the three offer dining reservations even though Booking acquired restaurant reservations platform OpenTable in 2014. At the time of the deal announcement, a lot of the talk was about the synergies between travel and dining, and how the acquisition would unleash ample opportunities to cross-promote the various brands.That never worked out, as current Booking officials would readily acknowledge.A couple of other interesting points is that Kayak’s key service is metasearch even though it dabbled over the years in offering facilitated flight bookings, and that none of the other five brands offer metasearch. Pundits, like myself, speculated over the years that the distinction between online travel agencies and metasearch companies would eventually blur because online travel agencies were beginning to offer metasearch features, and metasearch companies were starting to become booking sites.None of that blending happened in a significant way, although Booking, Expedia Group, and Trip.com Group now all own metasearch sites, namely Kayak, Trivago, and Skyscanner, respectively.Booking Is Adding to Its Employee Ranks in Asia PacificEmployees by Geography (as of December 31, 2022)Booking HoldingsAfter trimming its workforce in previous years, Booking ended up increasing its employee roster 6.4 percent year over year to 21,600 workers by the end of 2022. The biggest increase came in Asia Pacific, where it added 1,000 employees, and boosted that region’s share of total employees two percentage points to 34 percent of its labor force.Story continuesInterestingly, Booking shed 300 workers in the U.S. in 2022, even though it has been making market share gains in the country.Another point worth noting: Even though Booking competes in South America and Africa, only 2 percent of its workforce lives outside Europe, Asia Pacific and North America, and its number of employees, 400, in what it describes as the rest of the world, remained steady in 2022 compared with 2021.Booking Increased Is Percentage of Women Tech Workers in 2022Gender Diversity of Employees (as of December 31, 2022)Source: Booking HoldingsIn 2022, Booking Holdings’ workforce saw its ranks of women fall three percentage points year over year to 47 percent, although its roster of women in technology positions rose two percentage points to 25 percent. Over at Airbnb, in 2022 49 percent of its workforce was women.As in 2021, Booking Holdings filled 31 percent of its leadership ranks with women.Total Return Outpaced Expedia and Airbnb But Lagged Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500Source: Booking HoldingsIf you invested $100 in Booking Holdings’ shares at the end of 2017, you’d have a total return, including the reinvestment of dividends, of $115.97 at the end of 2022. In that regard, the 5-year total return for Booking Holdings outpaced the likes of other Internet companies in the RDG Internet Composite ($103.35), but fell considerably behind the Nasdaq Composite Index ($158.65) and the S&amp;P 500 ($156.89).If you had invested $100 in Expedia Group at the end of 2017, the total return would have been considerably lower that your initial investment five years later. You would also be in negative territory by the end of 2022 if you’d purchased $100 in Airbnb shares when it started trading on December 10, 2020.Expedia has essentially been in rebuilding mode since 2020, and Airbnb is not a mature company like nearly three-decade-old Booking Holdings, it should be noted.Booking Holdings Saw Room Nights Cross the 2019 Threshold in 2022Quarterly Room Nights bkng-20221231_g5.jpg… and Change Versus 2019Source: Booking HoldingsBooking Holdings saw the number of room nights it generated enter into positive territory on an annual basis compared with pre-Covid 2019 for the first time in 2022.

Per the terms of the agreement, Lockheed will offer non-recurring engineering support to aid qualify the re-designed Data Concentrator Unit and Blade Fold Distributor hardware on the CH-53K aircraft for the Navy.A major portion of the work related to this contract will be executed in Torrance, CA.Benefits of the ContractCountries across the world have been reinforcing their military resources due to intense geopolitical tensions and amplified terrorist threats.Among other combat arsenals and weaponries, military helicopters have been gaining importance owing to advancements and integration of new tactical and logistical features. This has provided ample opportunities for Lockheed Martin to win production and modification contracts for helicopters in the recent times. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.Such contract wins are likely to drive revenues from the Rotary and Mission Systems business segment, which comprises the Sikorsky helicopters including CH-53K.ProspectsThe United States, which is the largest exporter of military weaponries worldwide, is also strengthening its military resources. This is quite evident from the fiscal 2023 budget proposal worth $773 billion put forward by the Biden administration for the Department of Defense, with $56.5 billion planned investments in combat aircraft. Impressively, the defense budget request reflects a 4.1% increase from the fiscal 2022 enacted amount.Such solid budgetary provisions should benefit Lockheed, along with other defense manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC , Boeing BA and Textron TXT , that are also experts in military aircraft manufacturing.Story continuesSince its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft for combat.

The federal budget is due in May and the defence allocation is expected to grow.At the air show, some defence contractors privately expressed frustration that the tightly held review ordered last August, three months after a new centre-left government took office, had slowed down procurement and delivery times.Story continuesMajor decisions in the balance from the review include whether to order another squadron of Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 fighter jets, up to four more Northrop Grumman Corp MQ-4C Triton maritime surveillance drones and a major military satellite contract being pursued by five groups, including Airbus SE and Boeing Co.""Everyone is reading the tea leaves, but we know a lot of capability will be coming out of that DSR,"" said Stephen Forshaw, Airbus's chief representative for Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific.Australia ranked 12th globally in military spending in 2021 at $31.8 billion, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. It is a major buyer of U.S. equipment in particular, having operated alongside the U.S. in conflicts around the world. In 2021, it formed an alliance with the United States and Britain to buy nuclear-powered submarines.The air show also highlighted how Australia's smaller force is influencing U.S. purchases. Australia has operated Boeing E-7A airborne early warning and control planes since 2009, as the first customer for the type. The U.S. Air Force said on Tuesday it planned to buy 26 of them to replace its ageing E-3s.Boeing is also looking to sell the MQ-28 Ghost Bat fighter-like drone developed in Australia to the U.S. military, while the local arm of Britain's BAE Systems this week unveiled plans for a smaller armed drone it also hopes to export.Lockheed was selected last year alongside Raytheon Technologies Corp to accelerate the manufacture and delivery of guided weapons to Australia.In-country assembly, and eventually manufacturing, are a focus of the project that aims to build local stockpiles, said Ken Kota, vice president of Lockheed's Australian defence strategic capabilities office.""Manufacturing guided weapons in particular has its own deterrent effect,"" he said. ""It is very important for Australia to have this from a strategic standpoint."" (Reporting by Jamie Freed. Editing by Gerry Doyle)]"

China has sanctioned both companies for selling Taiwan weapons.China's Foreign Ministry said it was ""firmly"" opposed to the planned sale, adding that the United States should stop arms sales to and military contacts with Taiwan.CHINESE AIR FORCE INCURSIONTaiwan has complained for the past three years or so of stepped-up Chinese military activities near the island as Beijing seeks to assert its sovereignty claims.Taiwan reported on Thursday a second day of large-scale Chinese air force incursions into its air defence identification zone, with its defence ministry saying that during the last 24 hours it had spotted 21 aircraft.Story continuesChina has said its activities in the area are justified as it seeks to defend its territorial integrity and to warn the United States against ""colluding"" with Taiwan, despite the anger this causes in Taipei.Taiwan's defence ministry said the aircraft, 17 J-10 fighters and four J-16 fighters, had flown into the southwestern corner of Taiwan's air defence identification zone, according to a map the ministry released.The J-10s, an older model that entered service two decades ago, flew closer to the Chinese coast than Taiwan's, while the J-16s, a much newer and more advanced fighter, flew northeast of the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands, the map showed.The lightly defended Pratas are strategically located at the top of the South China Sea, and many of China's fly-bys happen nearby.Taiwan's forces monitored the situation, including sending up its own planes, the ministry added, using the normal phrasing for its response to such Chinese incursions.The ministry on Wednesday reported 19 Chinese aircraft flying in Taiwan's air defence zone.None of the aircraft crossed the sensitive median line of the Taiwan Strait, which has served as an unofficial barrier between the two sides, but which China's air force has been flying over almost daily since staging war games near Taiwan last August.Taiwan last reported a large median line crossing of Chinese aircraft on Friday, when 10 planes were involved.China has not commented on recent activities near Taiwan. In January, China said it staged combat drills around the island to ""resolutely counter the provocative actions of external forces and Taiwan independence separatist forces"".No shots have been fired and the Chinese aircraft have been flying in Taiwan's ADIZ, not in its territorial airspace.The ADIZ is a broader area Taiwan monitors and patrols that gives it more time to respond to any threats.Taiwan's government has repeatedly offered talks with China, but says the island will defend itself if attacked and that only the Taiwanese people can decide their own future.

The award has been offered by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealValued at $50.8 million, the contract is expected to be completed by July 2026. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will procure eight P-8A Increment 3 retrofit A-kits to include associated special tooling. This modification is aimed at supporting the Navy’s anti-submarine warfare capabilities upgrades.Majority of the work related to the contract will be carried out in Jacksonville, FL.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Furthermore, the company's expertise lies in a wide variety of aircraft components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk. Boeing's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, have resulted in a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such order flows, in turn, should boost the defense business segment’s top line.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like South America, the Asia Pacific and the Middle East are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals. Meanwhile, other nations like Europe and the United States have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest worldwide weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing, the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, thus enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global combat aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 2.5% during 2021-2026, with North America constituting the largest share of this market. Such growth can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities and increased defense spending. These projections should benefit Boeing, along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT.Since its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned combat aircraft.

Revenues are primarily derived from Fate’s collaborations with Janssen, a unit of Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ and Ono Pharmaceutical.R&amp;D expenses surged to $87.2 million from $69.5 million in the year-ago quarter.G&amp;A expenses jumped to $21.6 million from $16.9 million in the year-ago quarter.Cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of the fourth quarter were $441.2 million.Shares of Fate have plunged 82.2% in the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 11%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPipeline UpdateFATE is focused on the development and manufacture of universal, off-the-shelf cell products using its proprietary induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) product platform. Its immuno-oncology pipeline includes off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived natural killer (NK) cells and T-cell product candidates. These candidates are designed to synergize with well-established cancer therapies, including immune checkpoint inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies and to target tumor-associated antigens using chimeric antigen receptors (CARs).In December 2022, FATE presented interim phase I data from the first nine patients treated with a single dose of FT576 — its multiplexed-engineered, BCMA-targeted CAR NK cell product candidate for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Data from the single-dose treatment cohorts in heavily pre-treated patients showed encouraging clinical evidence of BCMA-targeted activity and a favorable safety profile, indicating the potential for administration in the outpatient setting.Story continuesFate is currently enrolling two-dose treatment cohorts as monotherapy and in combination with CD38-targeted mAb therapy at 300 million cells per dose and, upon clearance, the company plans to open and assess three-dose treatment cohorts starting at 1 billion cells per dose.Fate intends to submit an investigational new drug (IND) application to the FDA in mid-2023 to commence a phase I study of FT522 in combination with CD20-targeted mAb therapy for the treatment of B-cell lymphoma.Under its collaboration with ONO Pharmaceutical, Fate is co-developing FT825/ONO-8250, a multiplexed-engineered, iPSC-derived CAR T-cell product candidate targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-expressing solid tumors. The parties are conducting IND-enabling activities for FT825/ONO-8250 and expect to submit an IND application to the FDA in 2023 to commence a phase I study for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive solid tumors.Fate Therapeutics, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Fate Therapeutics, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseFate Therapeutics, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Fate Therapeutics, Inc. QuoteOther Key UpdatesIn January 2023, Fate announced the termination of its agreement with JNJ's Janssen. Both companies entered into an agreement in April 2020 to collaborate on the development of iPSC-derived CAR NK- and CAR T-cell product candidates for the treatment of cancer. During the fourth quarter of 2022, Janssen exercised its second commercial option for a collaboration product under the agreement, for which Fate expects to receive a $10 million milestone payment. Additionally, Janssen authorized the submission of and the FDA allowed an IND application for a first collaboration product for the treatment of B-cell lymphoma during the fourth quarter. FATE expects to receive a $3 million milestone payment for the same.As a result of the collaboration’s termination, during the first quarter of 2023, Fate and Janssen are winding down all collaboration activities, including discontinuing the development of all collaboration products, at the expense of Janssen.Fate has completed a strategic review of its NK cell programs and elected to advance its most innovative and differentiated product candidates. As a result of this program prioritization as well as the termination of the Janssen collaboration, Fate is discontinuing the development of its FT516, FT596, FT538 and FT536 NK cell programs and is reducing its workforce in the first quarter of 2023 to approximately 220 employees. Fate will most likely incur charges of approximately $12 million to $16 million for severance and other employee termination-related costs for the same.Fate currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

A copy of the same can be downloaded here. In the fourth quarter, the fund outperformed the Russell 1000 Value Index. Its Investor Class fund ARTLX returned 14.04%, Advisor Class fund APDLX posted a return of 14.14%, and Institutional Class fund APHLX returned 14.10% in the quarter, compared to a 12.42% return for the benchmark index.

Headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) develops and manufactures device-based medical therapies. On March 1, 2023, Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) stock closed at $82.08 per share. One-month return of Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) was -6.28%, and its shares lost 23.75% of their value over the last 52 weeks. Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) has a market capitalization of $109.198 billion.Artisan Value Fund made the following comment about Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“We also added to our position in Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), taking advantage of attractive prices. While procedure volumes for Medtronic, a medical technology company, are close to their pre-COVID levels, professional staffing shortages, supply chain constraints and some raw materials shortages globally have held back the availability of procedures. These factors have caused its top line to contract. However, foreign exchange has also been a big headwind. Each of its segments has its own respective reasons for ebbs and flows over the past couple quarters, but generally results have been soft and slow to recover. We are being patient with our investment in Medtronic because the company continues to be a strong free cash flow generator and is attractively priced, with a FCF yield of 5.3% and a dividend yield of 3.4%. Medtronic is under new management that is focused on growing the company’s top line, reinvesting in R&amp;D, returning cash to shareholders and growing operating profits. We like the new management’s strategy and believe new product launches, increased surgery visits, sound M&amp;A transactions and a shareholder-returns focus should reinvigorate the business.”Story continuesCountries with the Lowest Cancer Rates in the World in 2018ESB Professional/Shutterstock.comMedtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) is not on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

Take this earnings season so far: References to AI and related terms during calls with investors are already up 77% from a year earlier.Most Read from BloombergMeta Plans Thousands More Layoffs as Soon as This WeekUS Banks Are Finally Being Forced to Raise Rates on DepositsTesla Slashes Model S and X Prices for the Second Time This YearTrump’s Threat of a Third-Party Run Is Undercut by ‘Sore Loser’ LawsHolding Cash Will Be a Winning Strategy in 2023, Investors SayIt's no wonder. AI-hungry investors have propelled Nvidia Corp., which makes the chips needed for complex AI computing tasks, into the best-performing stock among mega-caps this year. Relatively obscure firms with AI in their names have also skyrocketed. BigBear.ai Holdings Inc. has surged more than 300%, while C3.ai Inc. and BuzzFeed Inc. have more than doubled. Guardforce AI Co. is up 51%.A lot of the companies tossing around the phrase AI are just taking advantage of the hype. Some are speaking aspirationally about how they see AI transforming their businesses — one day, some day. And then there are the real, practical use cases for AI and machine learning that companies have been actively investing in, developing and using — in some cases, long before AI became a buzzword — proving that the power of these algorithms is already reaching far beyond chatbots to change everything from the way companies manage their parts inventories to how they're recruiting for job candidates.“It is impossible to quantify what the impact of AI could be and equally possible that a wave of enthusiasm carries stocks with expertise in or exposure to AI, no matter how tenuous, higher and higher,” said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell Plc. “All investors can do is stick to their disciplines and focus on competitive position, management, and valuation, while making sure that they truly understand the business, before they put any capital at risk.”Story continuesThe tech-focused Nasdaq 100 Index traded slightly lower at the open on Wednesday. The index is up nearly 10% this year, far exceeding gains in the S&amp;P 500 Index.Below is a look at how various companies and industries are using AI — largely based on commentary from this quarter's earnings calls but also some key announcements made in recent weeks:AdvertisingAlphabet Inc.’s Google is using large language models to strengthen its search engine, specifically by helping anticipate the intent of users' queries, Philipp Schindler, Google’s chief business officer, said on the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call Feb. 2. AI is also used to increase consumer interactions with ads. “AI has been foundational to our ads business for the last decade,” he said.During Meta Platforms Inc.'s own earnings call, Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said AI is “the foundation of our discovery engine and ads business.” The company is investing more heavily in AI to develop privacy tools as well as help advertisers serve more ""relevant and engaging"" ads, he said. Some of those efforts are already paying off, with conversions, or an advertiser’s desired outcome from ads, increasing 20% in the last quarter compared with the prior year. Meta also uses AI for their content algorithms.AI has already become “fundamental” to WPP Plc, the world’s largest advertising group by revenue, said CEO Mark Read, adding that it can help find relevant audiences and measure the impact of the company’s work.SearchMicrosoft Corp. CEO Satya Nadella said there’s a “sea change” happening in search. The company’s AI model, Prometheus, will allow it to make the biggest leap ever in the relevance of results, he said. Its new Bing search engine adds the ability to chat and can help users compose emails and other content. Google will integrate the underlying technology in its Bard chatbot into its own engine. CEO Sundar Pichai has said this will produce results that “distill complex information and multiple perspectives into easy-to-digest formats.”TranslationZoom Video Communications Inc. CEO Eric Yuan pledged to “layer more AI technologies into our products,” and touted new features like translation, video captioning and analysis for sales.Medical devices, research and testingIn its own call, GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. highlighted that it hired Taha Kass-Hout, former vice president of machine learning and chief medical officer at Amazon.com Inc. The General Electric Co. spinoff is counting on Kass-Hout to lead its push for growth through improved machine-learning capabilities while it raises investment in digital services and software.One AI application the company specifically mentioned during its call with investors is an algorithm it offers to radiologists to help produce sharper images quicker. CEO Peter Arduini said the product has already reduced scan times for about 5.5 million patients globally. Another is a cardiac ultrasound product that uses AI to help assess heart muscle function.Medtronic Plc found its AI-assisted spinal surgery planning makes workflows “faster and more efficient,” CEO Geoffrey Martha said. The company’s adoption of AI to help physicians detect polyps in colonoscopies led to its gastrointestinal business growing in the ""high single-digits.""Charles River Laboratories International Inc. sees AI helping drug discovery, potentially by indicating whether a new drug will be as effective as an old one, said CEO James Foster.Medical testing center operator Quest Diagnostics Inc. said that it has begun using a highly automated microbiology lab system that leverages AI to analyze samples. CEO Jim Davis mentioned the platform in the company's earnings call when he was talking about ways in which it's trying to counter “significant inflation and wage pressures.”CybersecurityPalo Alto Networks Inc. CEO Nikesh Arora said the company has been using AI in its security services to prevent cyberattacks, and has done about $30 million in sales of its product that uses machine learning to detect threats.Product procurement, inventory and analysisFast food chain owner Yum! Brands Inc. uses AI to predict and recommend how much product restaurant managers should order each week for 3,000 of its U.S. Taco Bell and KFC locations. The aim is to reduce waste and transfers of inventory between stores. The company is working on a process to predict the quantity and time food should be cooked primarily in KFC restaurants, planning to pilot it in an international market.Home-improvement retailer Home Depot Inc. has given staff phones to compress dozens of systems into a simplified workflow and improve customer service, and the devices now include “Sidekick,” an app that uses machine learning to help employees prioritize tasks and know when inventory on shelves is running low.Tapestry Inc., owner of luxury brands like Coach and Kate Spade, highlighted new capabilities to use AI to forecast customer demand and curate its inventory. The analysis “helped to ensure our product was in the right place at the right time,” said CEO Joanne Crevoiserat.Caterpillar Inc., one the world's largest manufacturers of construction and mining equipment, is “investing heavily in AI,” CEO Jim Umpleby said. The company has for years been digitizing everything from bulldozers to diggers to get early alerts of problems and keep them from breaking down. Its system uses AI to better anticipate when a machine may break, and in some cases may automatically alert a dealer to provide a new part.Matching servicesAirbnb Inc. CEO Brian Chesky said AI can help the home-sharing company deal with the challenge of matching travelers to hosts when, unlike rooms in a hotel, every listing is unique. “If there's like 50,000 homes in a city, what's the right one for you?” he said. “That's less of a search problem than a matching problem, and I think that AI is going to be a really great opportunity for us.”Match Group Inc. CEO Bernard Kim said one way the company’s Tinder dating app “can really change the game is by leveraging machine learning to enhance recommendations.” The group already uses machine learning for safety and moderation, and its plan this year to expand its proficiency in the area will get a boost from its purchase of South Korea’s Hyperconnect, which brought with it a team with expertise in the area, he said.Hiring and talent acquisitionAt human resources consultant Robert Half International Inc., which has more than 30 million candidates in its database, Chief Financial Officer Michael Buckley said spending on AI will be “flattish” this year compared to 2022. AI has “transformed how we identify and select candidates,” and the company is working on how AI can identify leads for its sales professionals.Customer serviceWells Fargo &amp; Co. will start rolling out to customers an AI-powered virtual assistant called “Fargo” to personalize and simplify people’s banking experience, said CEO Charlie Scharf.CME Group Inc. agreed to a 10-year partnership with Google Cloud in 2021, using its data analytics and machine learning solutions to help CME provide clients with information and toolkits for developing models, algorithms and risk management, it said at the time. CEO Terrence Duffy said in early February the derivatives exchange operator doesn’t necessarily have to shell out to deliver AI for customers, as “we're able to get that through Google without having to make the investment ourselves.”VeriSign Inc., which provides domain registry services, said ChatGPT may enhance its NameStudio tool, which suggests alternatives if the name a consumer tries to register is already taken, said CEO Jim Bidzos.It's clear that not every company has embraced the AI hype with the same enthusiasm as the ones above. For every major company that mentioned AI in an earnings call this quarter, there were scores more that didn’t utter the phrase at all.Some companies, namely financial ones, have gone as far as to ban or restrict their employees' use of ChatGPT in particular. Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are among those that have recently banned employees from using the chatbot.The clamor for everything AI bears hallmarks of the cryptocurrency frenzy that took Wall Street by storm a few years back, and more recently the metaverse. Only time will tell if investor interest will last longer than it did for those similarly untested concepts.For his part Matthew Kanterman, director of research at Roundhill Investments, sees some big differences between AI and other more short-lived bets.The returns from AI are “more tangible, more real,” he said. It's “happening right now.”--With assistance from Paul Jarvis, Julia Love, Brody Ford, Dina Bass, Kurt Wagner and Joe Deaux.(Updates Nasdaq 100’s performance this year in the fifth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekYellowstone Backers Wanted to Cash Out—Then the Streaming Bubble BurstFemale Execs Are Exhausted, Frustrated and Heading for the ExitsFBI Documents Show Leonardo DiCaprio, Kim Kardashian Grilled for 1MDB SecretsThe Debt Ceiling Is the Risk Wall Street Doesn’t Want to Think AboutWith Gucci and Balenciaga Struggling, Kering Aims for a Reset©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this fertilizer maker have returned +7.4%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -2.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Fertilizers industry, which Mosaic falls in, has lost 3.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Mosaic is expected to post earnings of $1.74 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -27.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -18.6%.The consensus earnings estimate of $8.62 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -21.7%. This estimate has changed -3.8% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.56 indicates a change of -35.5% from what Mosaic is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.5%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for Mosaic.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MOS _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Mosaic, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $3.61 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $16.22 billion and $12.81 billion estimates indicate -15.2% and -21% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMosaic reported revenues of $4.48 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.7%. EPS of $1.74 for the same period compares with $1.95 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.31 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.05%. The EPS surprise was -16.35%.The company could not beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Mosaic is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Mosaic. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:ROK) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Rockwell Automation The ModelWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.23bUS$1.43bUS$1.66bUS$1.85bUS$2.17bUS$2.39bUS$2.58bUS$2.73bUS$2.87bUS$2.98bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x9Analyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 10.13%Est @ 7.72%Est @ 6.02%Est @ 4.84%Est @ 4.01% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.4% US$1.1kUS$1.2kUS$1.3kUS$1.3kUS$1.4kUS$1.4kUS$1.4kUS$1.3kUS$1.3kUS$1.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$13bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 9.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.0b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (9.4%– 2.1%) = US$42bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$42b÷ ( 1 + 9.4%)10= US$17bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$30b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$293, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Rockwell Automation as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.232. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Rockwell AutomationStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Electrical industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Electrical market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For Rockwell Automation, we've compiled three important factors you should further research:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Rockwell Automation , and understanding these should be part of your investment process.Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for ROK's future outlook?

In 2021, murders in Chicago reached their highest level in 25 years, outpacing other crime-ridden cities like New York City and Los Angeles.While homicides ebbed last year, other crimes continued to rise. Lightfoot sparred with the city’s law enforcement over a variety of issues and her failure to address the increase in violent crime prompted many corporations to relocate their headquarters out of the Chicago area.CHICAGO MAYOR LIGHTFOOT TELLS MCDONALD’S CEO TO ‘EDUCATE HIMSELF’ AFTER HE WARNS OF RISING CRIMEChicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot became the city's first mayor in 40 years to lose reelection following a rise in crime that spurred an exodus of major corporations from the Windy City.Boeing became the first major corporation to head for the exits when it announced in May 2022 that it would move its global headquarters from Chicago, where it had been located since 2001, and establish a new headquarters for its defense, space and security operations in Arlington, Virginia.Caterpillar followed suit a month later, announcing it would move its global headquarters from the Chicago suburb of Deerfield, Illinois, to Irving, Texas.READ ON THE FOX BUSINESS APPBillionaire Ken Griffin announced last June that he would move his hedge fund, Citadel, from Chicago to Miami.

The federal budget is due in May and the defence allocation is expected to grow.At the air show, some defence contractors privately expressed frustration that the tightly held review ordered last August, three months after a new centre-left government took office, had slowed down procurement and delivery times.Story continuesMajor decisions in the balance from the review include whether to order another squadron of Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 fighter jets, up to four more Northrop Grumman Corp MQ-4C Triton maritime surveillance drones and a major military satellite contract being pursued by five groups, including Airbus SE and Boeing Co.""Everyone is reading the tea leaves, but we know a lot of capability will be coming out of that DSR,"" said Stephen Forshaw, Airbus's chief representative for Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific.Australia ranked 12th globally in military spending in 2021 at $31.8 billion, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. It is a major buyer of U.S. equipment in particular, having operated alongside the U.S. in conflicts around the world. In 2021, it formed an alliance with the United States and Britain to buy nuclear-powered submarines.The air show also highlighted how Australia's smaller force is influencing U.S. purchases. Australia has operated Boeing E-7A airborne early warning and control planes since 2009, as the first customer for the type. The U.S. Air Force said on Tuesday it planned to buy 26 of them to replace its ageing E-3s.Boeing is also looking to sell the MQ-28 Ghost Bat fighter-like drone developed in Australia to the U.S. military, while the local arm of Britain's BAE Systems this week unveiled plans for a smaller armed drone it also hopes to export.Lockheed was selected last year alongside Raytheon Technologies Corp to accelerate the manufacture and delivery of guided weapons to Australia.In-country assembly, and eventually manufacturing, are a focus of the project that aims to build local stockpiles, said Ken Kota, vice president of Lockheed's Australian defence strategic capabilities office.""Manufacturing guided weapons in particular has its own deterrent effect,"" he said.

Our system has long had a commitment to completing every job, every day, safely. We are dedicated to continuous safety improvement to advance our safety culture.As part of our focus on continuous improvement, in 2018 we recognized that our ""Target Zero"" safety initiative to pursue zero workplace injuries, set with the best of intentions, had unintended consequences - a hesitance to report minor incidents and near-misses. While we continue to measure rates of recordable injuries, lost-time rate and days away, we have modified a portion of our compensation goals to focus on serious injuries rather than total injuries. We have come to recognize that lessons learned from reporting all incidents provide the best opportunities to build trust, apply human performance principles and advance our safety program. Better understanding the precursors of potentially serious incidents helps us identify and implement the critical controls necessary to prevent serious injuries. We hone and build on our safety culture by engaging all employees in our solutions, continuing to share and build on learnings, and contributing to continuous process improvement to enhance safety. Our programs and processes resulted in a reduction to serious injuries and the best safety performance in our history in 2021.Story continuesOur commitment is to Safety First.

The outlook assigned to these Credit Ratings (ratings) is positive. The existing ratings of Cigna and its subsidiaries are unchanged.The proceeds from the issuance will be used to pay down upcoming debt maturities and for general corporate purposes. Cigna has close to $3 billion of senior unsecured notes coming due throughout 2023. Cigna’s financial leverage was 40.9% at year-end 2022, which is in line with its peers. Financial leverage has moderated substantially over the past several years following the $67 billion acquisition of Express Scripts in late 2018. Financial leverage is expected to increase slightly after the new debt issuance but will return to the 40% range as maturities are paid. Cigna’s earnings before interest and taxes interest coverage improved in 2022 to over 8.2 times compared with 6.5 times in 2021 due to stronger earnings. Cigna’s earnings from health care operations grew 13% in 2022 compared with 2021 as medical cost ratio posted a 230 basis points improvement mainly driven by lower COVID-19 claims and pricing initiatives. Non-regulated earnings at the Evernorth segment improved by 5% supported by revenue growth. The Evernorth segment comprised about 75% of revenues, and 53% of earnings from operations for the enterprise-reducing pressure for dividends form the insurance subsidiaries. The dividends from Cigna insurance entities declined to $1.9 billon in 2022 from $2.8 billion and $2.3 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively.In addition to operating earnings, Cigna’s financial position was enhanced through $5.5 billion of proceeds from divestiture of its Asia-Pacific insurance operations completed in mid-2022. The proceeds from the sale were used primarily for share repurchase. Cigna repurchased $7.6 billion worth of shares in 2022, slightly lower compared with 2021. Furthermore, Cigna paid a cash dividend of $1.4 billion in 2022 and announced a 10% increase in dividend for 2023.Story continuesCigna maintains good liquidity and financial flexibility through parent company cash, a commercial paper program and several credit facilities, as well as the ability to borrow up to $3 billion from the insurance subsidiaries without additional authorizations. There was no commercial paper outstanding or any borrowing against credit facilities at year-end 2022.Goodwill and intangibles assets remain high at approximately 100% of shareholders equity. However, the ratio declined from over 150% in 2018 when the purchase of Express Scripts was completed. In addition, high goodwill/intangibles is tied primarily to non-insurance operations, which continue to produce stable earnings and provide a substantial degree of diversification.This press release relates to Credit Ratings that have been published on AM Best’s website.

Young adults are feeling burnt out by the endless rise and grind of work, and they’re starting to wonder what’s the point of it all.More from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeHow to save money in 7 easy steps The best boarding schools: where the world's elite are sending their kidsThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 homeA whopping 98% of young adults ages 18 to 24 are experiencing worker burnout, according to Cigna 360’s Global Well-Being Survey 2022. Surveying almost 12,000 employees from 15 countries, Cigna found that younger workers are feeling the strain at work more than their older coworkers: 91% of Gen Zers and 87% of millennials report being stressed. That’s compared to 84% of overall employees.“We can’t attribute all our modern stress levels to COVID; there are myriad other factors, from the pressure of being ‘on’ all the time at work to the amount of media we consume, through to the cost-of-living crisis,” Dr. Peter Mills, Cigna’s medical director, wrote in the report.Workers overall are reckoning with the “Great Exhaustion,” as the report is aptly named. And younger workers are feeling stressed out for plenty of reasons: a lack of learning and job opportunities, uncertainty about the future, and, most of all, money.Financial insecurity fuels Gen Z’s high stress levels. Thirty-nine percent of Gen Zers and 34% of millennials said finances were their leading stressor, compared to 29% of 50- to 64-year-olds. Younger workers are increasingly worried about money and the future, as many junior employees (40%) report they’re concerned about the rising cost of living. And those who were more worried about their finances tended to report greater levels of stress.Their stress is understandable. In June, inflation reached a 40-year high and while consumer prices have ebbed a bit since then, many young adults are dealing with high prices while living on their own for the first time. Coupled with recession fears, it’s no wonder young adults are anxious about money. Many are already cutting back spending in preparation for an economic downturn. Saving more and working harder than other generations in anticipation of a recession is likely adding to the pressure on this already stressed-out cohort.Story continuesYounger workers also tend to have less of a financial cushion and stable career position than their older counterparts.“Gen Z employees would be most at risk if a recession were to happen,” Jovan Johnson, a certified financial planner and co-owner of Piece of Wealth Planning firm told Fortune’s Megan Leonhardt. “Most employers start layoffs with newer employees.”The economy isn’t the only thing younger workers are worrying about. Just over 30% of both Gen Z and millennials said uncertainty over the future is stressing them out. Anxiety regarding climate change further causes feelings of disillusion with work for a generation already struggling to pay the bills. It’s not just the future of planet Earth that’s in flux, it’s also their own—many doubt they’ll ever be able to build enough wealth to afford a home.Younger employees are also concerned about a lack of career opportunities. It may explain why nearly half of those under age 35 are on the hunt for a new job.The deep shifts we’ve seen at work and in the economy since the pandemic began have led many to reevaluate their life priorities: 65% overall, and 71% and 73% of Gen Zers and millennials, respectively, Cigna finds. It's enough to push them over the edge at work, leaving your junior colleagues more burnt out than you might realize.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeHow to save money in 7 easy steps The best boarding schools: where the world's elite are sending their kidsThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home]"

One well-known investing sage thinks that is completely unlikely to happen.Billionaire investor Leon Cooperman thinks the S&amp;P 500 is about to slip by 22% from here while also anticipating the US economy gets dragged down into a recession.“I think QT, Fed tightening, the high price of oil, or maybe a strong dollar — some combination of these four things creates a recession, and the final bottom of the market will be about 35% below the 4,800 peak,” the chairman and CEO of Omega Advisors elaborated.However, that’s not to say Cooperman has been throwing out the baby with the bath water. In his portfolio, and accounting for a big chunk at that, there are names that over the past year have outperformed the market by a wide margin. By holding on to them, Cooperman evidently thinks that while bad times are coming, these stocks will keep on delivering.With this in mind, we dipped into the TipRanks database and pulled up the details on two Cooperman-owned stocks.

EPS rose 22% y/y, from $1.57 in 4Q21 to $1.91 in 4Q22, while meeting Street expectations.Story continuesThere was promising stuff in the outlook too. For 2023, the company is calling for organic revenue growth between 7% and 9% and adjusted earnings per share between $7.25 to $7.40, above Wall Street’s $7.28 forecast.The Street liked the results, sending shares higher in the aftermath of the release. In fact, investors have been propping up the shares over the past year. The stock has posted 12-month gains of 19%, far outpacing the S&amp;P 500’s 8% loss.Cooperman must think that FISV stock will keep on outperforming. Almost 9% of his portfolio is taken up by FISV shares. Specifically, he holds 1,030,600 shares, currently worth just over $118.6 million.Tigress Financial’s Ivan Feinseth is also a big fan of Fiserv. Laying out the bull case for the fintech company, the 5-star analyst writes: “FISV’s industry-leading position, asset strength, agility, and new product launches will continue to drive accelerating growth. FISV continues to benefit from online and in-store payments growth, and it is one of the leading companies driving new payment technologies and the secular shift to electronic payments. FISV will continue to grow within a growing market and increasingly penetrate a growing client base through ongoing new product development and strategic acquisitions to expand its product and services portfolio.”These comments form the basis for Feinseth’s Buy rating on FISV, while his $154 price target makes room for 34% share growth in the year ahead. (To watch Feinseth’s track record, click here)Most on the Street agree with Feinseth; FISV’s Moderate Buy consensus rating is based on 19 reviews, breaking down to 15 Buys, 3 Holds, and 1 Sell. The current trading price is $115.09, and the $130.32 average price target implies a one-year upside of ~13% from that level. (See Fiserv stock forecast)The Cigna Group (CI)The next Cooperman-endorsed stock is Cigna, a global health services company. This large-cap provides insurance and health services to a whole range of customers, including businesses, families and individuals. In fact, Cigna is one of the health industry giants, and one of the world’s biggest health insurers.Some numbers tell the story nicely; The company saw out 2022 with almost 190 million total customer relationships and total revenues for the year were $180.5 billion. The health insurance industry is expected to keep on expanding over the coming years, making Cigna well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for health insurance.The company recently delivered a solid report to close out 2022. Q4 revenue hit $45.75 billion, in-line with Street expectations while adj. EPS of $4.96 bettered the analysts’ $4.87 forecast.However, the outlook came in a bit soft; for the full year, the company sees adjusted revenues of at least $187 billion vs. consensus at $190.20 billion.The shares trended down post-earnings and have underperformed so far this year. Nevertheless, zoom out a bit and you find that over the trailing twelve months, the shares have significantly outperformed the broader market – having appreciated by 25% over the period.This blue chip also pays a regular dividend. It currently yields 1.68% – more or less the same as the S&amp;P average – but given the company only recently increased the payout by 10%, further increases could be forthcoming in the years ahead.As for Cooperman’s involvement, he owns 450,000 shares, which make up almost 9% of his portfolio. At the current share price, these are worth more than $131 million.Covering the stock for J.P. Morgan, analyst Lisa Gill believes momentum is “set to carry into 2023.” Looking ahead, the 5-star analyst writes, “While recession remains a concern given CI’s exposure to the Commercial market, management noted that an uptick in dis-enrollment is baked into 2023 guidance. We are also encouraged by strong performance within Evernorth (the subsidiary that provides pharmacy, care, and benefit solutions) reflecting substantial new client wins (Centene PBM contract), customer retention returning to historical levels in the upper-90% range, and with specialty pharmacy a key long-term tailwind.”“We believe CI deserves to trade above its historical multiple given the growth opportunity within specialty and biosimilars, in particular, coupled with continued strong growth in the health plan business,” Gill went on to add.To this end, Gill rates CI shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy) backed by a $370 price target. The implication for investors? Upside of ~28% from current levels. (To watch Gill’s track record, click here)Elsewhere on the Street, the stock garners an additional 7 Buys and Holds, each, for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The forecast calls for one-year returns of ~21%, considering the average target stands at $352.33.

194,2165a14c-478a-34ff-a0c9-9cf024520b02,CI,2023-03-02,Cigna Group (CI) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cigna-group-ci-attracting-investor-140002208.html,1677679202,STORY,['CI'],"[Cigna (CI) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this health insurer have returned -7.8%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -2.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Insurance - Multi line industry, which Cigna falls in, has lost 3.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Cigna is expected to post earnings of $5.35 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -11%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -7.7%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $24.79 points to a change of +6.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.9%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $28.20 indicates a change of +13.8% from what Cigna is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.3%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Cigna is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CI _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Cigna, the consensus sales estimate of $45.26 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2.6%. The $187.69 billion and $224.21 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +3.9% and +19.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCigna reported revenues of $45.74 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +0.2%. EPS of $4.96 for the same period compares with $4.77 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $45.58 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.37%. The EPS surprise was +2.48%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Cigna is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Cigna. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The award has been offered by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealValued at $19.6 million, the contract is expected to be completed by August 2024. Per the terms of the agreement, Lockheed will offer non-recurring engineering support to aid qualify the re-designed Data Concentrator Unit and Blade Fold Distributor hardware on the CH-53K aircraft for the Navy.A major portion of the work related to this contract will be executed in Torrance, CA.Benefits of the ContractCountries across the world have been reinforcing their military resources due to intense geopolitical tensions and amplified terrorist threats.Among other combat arsenals and weaponries, military helicopters have been gaining importance owing to advancements and integration of new tactical and logistical features. This has provided ample opportunities for Lockheed Martin to win production and modification contracts for helicopters in the recent times. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.Such contract wins are likely to drive revenues from the Rotary and Mission Systems business segment, which comprises the Sikorsky helicopters including CH-53K.ProspectsThe United States, which is the largest exporter of military weaponries worldwide, is also strengthening its military resources. This is quite evident from the fiscal 2023 budget proposal worth $773 billion put forward by the Biden administration for the Department of Defense, with $56.5 billion planned investments in combat aircraft. Impressively, the defense budget request reflects a 4.1% increase from the fiscal 2022 enacted amount.Such solid budgetary provisions should benefit Lockheed, along with other defense manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC , Boeing BA and Textron TXT , that are also experts in military aircraft manufacturing.Story continuesSince its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft for combat. Northrop Grumman also has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance and aircraft self-protection systems. It also enables warfighters to accomplish missions under any conditions.NOC stock boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.5%.

This segment also produces rotorcraft and rotary-wing programs like CH-47 Chinook, AH-64 Apache and V-22 Osprey.BA stock boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 4%.

The award has been offered by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealValued at $50.8 million, the contract is expected to be completed by July 2026. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will procure eight P-8A Increment 3 retrofit A-kits to include associated special tooling. This modification is aimed at supporting the Navy’s anti-submarine warfare capabilities upgrades.Majority of the work related to the contract will be carried out in Jacksonville, FL.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Furthermore, the company's expertise lies in a wide variety of aircraft components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk. Boeing's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, have resulted in a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such order flows, in turn, should boost the defense business segment’s top line.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like South America, the Asia Pacific and the Middle East are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals. Meanwhile, other nations like Europe and the United States have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest worldwide weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing, the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, thus enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global combat aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 2.5% during 2021-2026, with North America constituting the largest share of this market. Such growth can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities and increased defense spending. These projections should benefit Boeing, along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT.Since its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned combat aircraft. Northrop Grumman also has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance and aircraft self-protection systems that enable warfighters to accomplish missions anytime and anywhere.Story continuesNorthrop Grumman has a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.5%.

(VFC) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this maker of brands such as Vans, North Face and Timberland have returned -19.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -2.5% change. The Zacks Textile - Apparel industry, to which V.F. belongs, has lost 6.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.V.F. is expected to post earnings of $0.14 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -68.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -51.9%.The consensus earnings estimate of $2.08 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -34.6%. This estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.20 indicates a change of +5.5% from what V.F. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -6.4%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for V.F.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for VFC _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For V.F. the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2.75 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -2.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $11.62 billion and $12.04 billion estimates indicate -1.9% and +3.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryV.F. reported revenues of $3.53 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -2.6%. EPS of $1.12 for the same period compares with $1.35 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.49 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.14%. The EPS surprise was +13.13%.Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.V.F. is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about V.F. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company terminated an advance purchase agreement that went unfulfilled, but kept the advance payment as per the agreement.Chief Financial Officer Jim Kelly said the shift to a commercial market and the ending of the public health emergency in the U.S. — and shifting to an endemic phase of the COVID outbreak globally — was the reason for the uncertainty clause in the earnings statement and a lack of a 2023 outlook.""Given these uncertainties, substantial doubt exists regarding our ability to continue as a going concern through one year from the date that these financial statements are issued,"" Novavax said in the statement.Novavax's only authorized product, the COVID-19 vaccine, missed the pandemic boom and faces market challenges in 2023, all while a new CEO, John Jacobs, is taking the helm.People pose with syringe with needle in front of displayed Novavax logo in this illustration taken, December 11, 2021.

Pfizer received a recommendation by a panel of external FDA advisers for its RSV vaccine in ages 60 and older Tuesday.Story continues""I'm aware that over the past few years we have experienced both highs and lows,"" Jacobs said on an earnings call late Tuesday, adding that he pledges to be humble and transparent ""about our opportunities as well as our challenges.""COVID-19 vaccineNovavax is anticipating vaccine sales to pick up in the second half of 2023, as vaccinations become more seasonal.Executive vice president and chief commercial officer John Trizzino said that the COVID vaccine remains a more than $15 billion annual global market that includes continued government interest even with a growing commercial market across the U.S., European Union and, Asia.The company plans on producing variant-specific doses this fall, as well as — similar to other makers — reducing the size of vials to include fewer doses per vial.To-date the company's strength has been its ex-U.S. business. The ongoing clinical trials reflect as much, with a study of recipients who have HIV, as well as the benefit of a second boost with those who previously received mRNA vaccines.In addition, the company still has $2 billion in advance purchase orders to fulfill this year and next.Meanwhile, Novavax is also still working on its adolescent and younger age group trials.Pipeline assessmentThe company will continue looking at a combination flu-COVID vaccine.Meanwhile, the company is awaiting assessment of one of its flu vaccines to decide on whether or not to restart the program. The results would determine if the company chooses ""dilutive or non-dilutive"" funding options, according to CFO Kelly.The company also announced it will focus on partnerships and other relationships.To that effect, the manufacturing facility in the Czech Republic just received authorization from the European Medicines Agency to supply a antigen drug substance to the European Union. Novavax has similarly applied for authorization with the FDA.This could help create more partnerships as well as strengthens the company's internal infrastructure, Trizzino said on the call Tuesday.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhemClick here for the latest trending stock tickers of the Yahoo Finance platformClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

Well, for one thing, the cloud-based software company's stock is down about 21% over the last twelve months (up around 22% year-to-date).""It's been a long conversation around what Salesforce margins could be,"" said Wells Fargo analyst Michael Turrin. ""Now, it's become more pronounced over the last three to five years because we've seen other businesses achieve different margin structures. Though Salesforce has transitioned management team members over time and they've shown signs of becoming a mature company, the intensity of the [cost-cutting] conversation has certainly picked up.""Last quarter, Salesforce said that its Q3 GAAP operating margin was about 5.9%, while competitor Oracle's (ORCL) latest GAAP operating margin was 25%. The company also laid off about 10% of its staff in January, a sea change after years of talking about Salesforce as ""a family.""Here's what Wall Street's expecting to see from Salesforce's key metrics today, as compiled by Bloomberg:Q4 2023 revenue: $8 billion expected versus $7.33 billion actual in Q4 2022Q4 2023 adjusted earnings per share (EPS): $1.37 expected versus $0.84 in Q4 2022Q4 2023 adjusted operating margin: 22.4% expected versus 15% in Q4 2022Even if these numbers hold – and the non-GAAP numbers look even dicier – it's going to be a tough day for Salesforce: they're ultimately anticipated to report their slowest-ever quarterly revenue growth.Who are the so-called activists?So far, the list – and it always seems to grow – is Third Point, ValueAct, Inclusive Capital, Elliott Management, and Starboard Value. The latest addition: ""anti-woke"" Strive Asset Management.Story continuesSaid Jeff Gramm, Bandera Partners portfolio manager: ""Though we likely won't see these activists working together expressly, but implicitly dynamics will be set up...certainly a good cop, bad cop dynamic could develop.” Gramm noted hat ValueAct is less aggressive and less likely to launch a proxy fight than, say, Starboard and Third Point.The bottom line: this is a giant pain in the neck for Benioff at best, existential at worst.Here's a quick look at each firm circling Salesforce—and what they may want:Third PointThird Point, led by billionaire investor Dan Loeb, has picked a number of high-profile fights over the years notably Disney (DIS), Campbell Soup (CPB), and Shell (SHEL). In 2020, Loeb took a stake in Intel (INTC), launching a campaign that would lead to Pat Gelsinger’s rise to the chipmaker’s CEO role – and the ousting of Bob Swan. The size of Third Point’s stake and the full scale of its intentions at Salesforce haven't been confirmed, but Loeb's capable of launching a fearsome proxy fight. In other words: he's not in the stock for a free ticket to the company's Dreamforce events.Inclusive CapitalThere’s a link between ValueAct and Inclusive – Jeff Ubben founded Inclusive after his tenure at ValueAct, which he co-founded in 2000. Ubben launched Inclusive Capital in 2020, and he’s been busy. In 2021, Ubben was appointed to the board of ExxonMobil (XOM) and has been building up a massive holding in industrial wood pellet-maker Enviva (EVA). Inclusive, which focuses more on social investing as compared to ValueAct, owns 1.6 million shares of Salesforce, SEC filings show. They're likely to be more passive than, say, Third Point.Under siege? Marc Benioff, Founder and CEO of Salesforce, November 3, 2015. REUTERS/Elijah NouvelageValueActValueAct is something of an oddity in the activist landscape as it doesn’t frequently go public with its investing plans. However, the firm recently revealed a stake in Spotify (SPOT) and that combined with ValueAct’s involvement in Salesforce suggests, it’s currently taking aim at macro-economic-rattled tech giants. The firm also has experience with big names in tech, previously notching a 2013 win at Microsoft (MSFT) and previously holding a stake in Adobe (ADBE).In ValueAct’s case, though the details of the firm’s Salesforce stake remain unknown, Salesforce has yielded somewhat already. On Jan. 27, the company added ValueAct CEO and CIO Mason Morfit to its board.Elliott ManagementElliott often goes for the jugular. The firm, which has been among the most prolific activist investors in recent years, is fronted by Jesse Cohn and Paul Singer. It will often seek board representation. Elliott’s previous tech targets have included PayPal (PYPL), AT&amp;T (T), Dell (DELL), and Twitter. In 2022, Elliott struck a deal that landed senior Elliott portfolio manager Marc Steinberg on Pinterest’s (PINS) board.The details of Elliott’s stake and intentions in Salesforce are fuzzy, but sources tell Yahoo Finance the stake is a “multi-billion” investment. Additionally, those sources added that Elliott would like to see way more focus by Salesforce CEO Benioff on succession planning and expense management. On March 1, Elliott reportedly nominated a slate of directors to Salesforce's board.Starboard ValueStarboard Value’s involvement in Salesforce traces back to October, when a presentation on the firm’s site revealed that it had taken a “significant stake” in Salesforce. Sources tell Yahoo Finance Starboard has been disappointed in Salesforce’s expense management, but isn’t advocating for a sale of workplace messaging app Slack, which In 2021 Salesforce purchased for a mind-numbing $27.7 billion acquisition. Company watchers—and that would probably include our activists — have questioned whether Salesforce truly integrated Slack to date and whether they should sell it all together.Notably, this isn’t Jeff Smith-led Starboard’s first run at a SaaS business. In 2019, Starboard targeted Box (BOX), taking a stake as high as 8.8%. Starboard ultimately lost the subsequent, hard-fought proxy battle at Box, which is fundamentally a much smaller company than Salesforce. (Box’s Q3 2023 revenue was $250 million, while Salesforce’s was $7.84 billion.) Could Smith try again?Just say no to woke: Strive's Vivek Ramaswamy at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in 2022. REUTERS/Brian SnyderStrive Asset ManagementStrive was co-founded by ""anti-woke"" presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. The firm, on Feb. 27, wrote a letter to Benioff, demanding that he pull back on Salesforce's social messaging, instead focusing on profit. Penned by Strive President Anson Frericks, the letter itself includes sections like:""So-called 'stakeholder capitalism' is nothing more than an ethos that allows its CEO to anoint himself a 'hero' who is 'sav[ing] the world' as he rubs elbows with fellow billionaires in Davos, while leaving Salesforce shareholders holding the bag. It chooses politics over profits, race baiting over revenue, and virtue signaling over value, harming the millions of Americans who have invested in Salesforce.""Among Strive's demands: that Salesforce remove ""all references to stakeholder capitalism.""So, what's next? That hinges in part on how Benioff responds (and how good Salesforce's earnings look), but it goes beyond that. Elliott and other activists can't do much without the support of Salesforce's largest investors such as Vanguard, BlackRock, State Street, Fidelity, T. Rowe Price, Geode, Morgan Stanley, Fisher, UBS, and Wellington.""As much stock as these activists might own, it's really not material – they're really going to have to convince people,"" said Gramm. ""Ultimately, this typically boils down to how disgusted shareholders are and for these big guys to support an activist they have to be really, really upset.""Allie Garfinkle is a Senior Tech Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

The investment coincides with Cebu City becoming one of the emerging outsourcing destinations globally, making it imperative for the company to set up a regional digital transformation center to cater to the higher demand.    It is developing the Cebu Japan Innovation Hub in the Philippines CIC, which serves more than 200 clients worldwide with automation, analytics and AI services. The Philippines CIC supports clients across 15 languages, including English, Mandarin and Japanese, and has been assisting Japan-based clients with project delivery since 2016.The new hub will be manned by Filipino workforce with specialized skillsets in data analytics, AI, hybrid cloud transformation, application management, supply chain, finance and procurement. Leveraging AI, ML and automation techniques, it combines human expertise and advanced technologies for faster response, efficiency and transparency through a holistic approach to secure hybrid cloud environments.IBM expects its growth to be driven primarily by analytics, cloud computing and security services. A better business mix, improving operating leverage through productivity gains and increased investments in growth opportunities will likely drive its profitability.However, IBM’s ongoing, heavily time-consuming business model transition to the cloud is likely to be a headwind in the near term. Although the public cloud market is expected to be one of the fastest-growing IT categories, with about 25% to 30% CAGR over the next five years, IBM is unlikely to keep up with its competitors. High integration risks from continuous acquisition sprees are potent challenges.In addition, weakness in its traditional business and foreign exchange volatility remain significant concerns. Also, higher profit on lower revenues indicates that the company has been lowering costs to maintain profits. We believe that the scope for further cost-cutting is limited. Consequently, if costs are further reduced, there could be a negative impact on product quality. It could also lead to an additional delay in launching products, denting its long-term growth potential to some extent.The stock has gained 4.4% over the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 7.2%.

216,45677233-0872-3a81-9b04-276e3b5d8218,MPC,2023-03-02,7 Cash-Rich Companies to Invest in During Economic Uncertainty,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-cash-rich-companies-invest-191253143.html,1677438773,STORY,"['TGT', 'CVX', 'FNV', 'MPC', 'TSM', 'MNST', 'GILD']","[While it’s generally good to be optimistic, in the market, it also pays to be realistic, thus incentivizing consideration for cash-rich stocks to buy. Here, we’re not necessarily talking about the most exciting ventures available. Rather, we’re targeting enterprises that have plenty of green-colored paper in the bank. This way, these cash-imbued entities can weather whatever storms might break out.At the same time, it doesn’t make too much sense to have plenty of cash if you’re also waist-deep in debt. In addition, investors should exclusively target cash-rich stocks if it means their money will go absolutely nowhere. Therefore, I included various attributes into this discussion beyond just owning plenty of currency.Primarily, each of these companies have zero debt on their books. As well, they feature analyst price targets (at time of writing) that all imply double-digit percentage returns. Without further ado, below are the cash-rich stocks to buy for uncertain times.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMNSTMonster Beverage$101.23GILDGilead$80.66MPCMarathon Petroleum$124.92TSMTaiwan Semiconductor$88.11CVXChevron$162.41ULUnilever$50.28FNVFranco-Nevada$125.27Cash-Rich Stocks: Monster Beverage (MNST)a man sitting behind a pile of cashSource: ShutterstockWhile Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST) may be caffeine-rich, investors may not realize that it’s also one of the cash-rich stocks. As of the third quarter of 2022, the company carried $1.3 billion in cash and its equivalents. As well, it carried $1.35 billion worth of marketable securities. Therefore, its total liquid assets amounted to $2.65 billion. Notably, its total liabilities amounted to only $1.39 billion.In addition, the company enjoys many other fiscal attributes. Naturally, Monster Beverage commands excellent stability in the balance sheet, particularly its Altman Z-Score of 26.49 reflecting extremely low bankruptcy risk. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 15.3%, outpacing 85.56% of the competition. Also, its net margin stands at 19.46, above 92.52% of the industry.Story continuesNot surprisingly, Wall Street analysts peg MNST as a consensus strong buy. Further, their average price target stands at $113.36, implying over 10% upside potential. Therefore, it may well be a no-brainer among cash-rich stocks to buy.Cash-Rich Stocks: Gilead Sciences (GILD)7 Stocks to Buy Benefiting From Millennial MoneySource: ShutterstockOne of the top biopharmaceutical companies, Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) for the most part enjoyed a quiet cycle in 2022. However, late last year, strong demand for its cancer drug skyrocketed GILD stock. In the trailing year, shares gained over 38% of equity value. However, it’s off to a less-auspicious start for 2023, declining over 3%.Nevertheless, investors may want to keep tabs on GILD because it ranks among the cash-rich stocks to consider. As of the fourth quarter of 2022, the company carried a total liquid asset count of $7.63 billion. Further, total assets amounted to $63.2 billion, while total liabilities came out to nearly $42 billion. In addition, Gilead was free cash flow (FCF) positive at $2.57 billion.Notably, despite its market momentum, Gilead pings as objectively undervalued. Currently, the market prices GILD at a forward multiple of 12.13. As a discount to earnings, the biopharma ranks better than 73.11% of its rivals.Finally, covering analysts peg GILD as a consensus moderate buy. As well, their average price target stands at $92.33, implying nearly 12% upside potential.Cash-Rich Stocks: Marathon Petroleum (MPC)cow made out of cash in green field with bright blue sky behind itSource: Reel2Reel/shutterstock.comWith the cynical combination of soaring inflation and geopolitical flashpoints, Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) practically had nowhere to go but up. Over the trailing year, MPC gained almost 69%, a staggering performance. Also, momentum remains robust in the new year, with shares moving up over 13% since the January opener.Despite its massive upside, investors may want to give Marathon another look because it ranks among cash-rich stocks. Looking at the company’s Q4 2022 disclosure, Marathon carried $8.63 billion in cash and its equivalents. Also, it had $3.15 billion in marketable securities. In total, its liquid assets amounted to $11.8 billion. During Q4, Marathon pinged as FCF positive at $1.81 billion.Interestingly, MPC rates as undervalued. Objectively, the market prices MPC at a trailing multiple of 4.39. As a discount to earnings, Marathon ranks better than nearly 71% of the competition.Lastly, covering analysts peg MPC as a consensus strong buy. Further, their average price target stands at $142.60, implying almost 14% upside potential.Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM)man's hand holding wads of cashSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comAdmittedly, mentioning Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) on this list of cash-rich stocks to buy presents significant risks. With seemingly everyone wanting to blow each other up these days, Taiwan stands on shaky ground. That’s not exactly confidence inspiring when it comes to investments to depend on during the troubles.At the same time, it’s quite possible that China will not be as imprudent as its neighbor Russia. Therefore, Taiwan Semiconductor may be incredibly undervalued. One thing’s for sure: TSM ranks among the cash-rich stocks. Per the company’s Q4 earnings report, the company commanded $50.94 billion in cash and its equivalents. As well, total liabilities amounted to only $30.8 billion.In addition, the market prices TSM at a forward multipole of 16.44. As a discount to earnings, Taiwan Semiconductor ranks better than 65.52% of the industry. As well, the technology firm enjoys excellent revenue growth and net profitability metrics.Turning to the Street, covering analysts peg TSM as a consensus strong buy. Further, their average price target stands at $104.33, implying nearly 16% upside potential.Chevron (CVX)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockAs one of the supermajors in the global hydrocarbon space, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) needs no introduction. Moreover, it needs no explanation for why CVX bounced dramatically higher. For instance, in the trailing year, CVX gained 20% of equity value. And that’s inclusive of a 7% loss since the January opener. Fears of potentially greater inflation from China’s reopening along with geopolitical jitters should keep things interesting at Chevron.Still, investors should target CVX for any concerns they have because it’s one of the cash-rich stocks to buy. According to its Q4 2022 earnings report, the company carried $17.7 billion in cash and its equivalents. As well, it had $223 million in marketable securities. This gave the company a total liquid asset count of $17.9 billion.In addition, Chevron enjoys broad fiscal strengths. Naturally, it features excellent stability in the balance sheet. Operationally, its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 18.1%, outpacing 81.81% of its peers. Its net margin is 15%, above 68% of the competition.Looking to Wall Street, covering analysts peg CVX as a consensus moderate buy. In addition, their average price target stands at $190.23, implying over 17% upside potential.Unilever (UL)Source: ShutterstockA consumer goods giant, Unilever (NYSE:UL) enjoys broad fundamental relevancies. Essentially, no matter what’s going on with the economy, people need certain basic goods. That’s exactly where Unilever comes in, feeding everyday demand. It’s not glamorous but during down cycles or moments of uncertainty, UL commands plenty of confidence.In addition, it’s one of the top cash-rich stocks to buy. According to its Q4 2022 earnings report, Unilever’s cash and its equivalent line item reached $4.58 billion. As well, the company had $1.27 billion worth of marketable securities. All told, its liquid asset count came out to $5.85 billion. The company was FCF positive to the tune of $3.39 billion.For other fiscal attributes, Unilever represents a slow-and-steady player. For instance, its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 6.8% – not bad, not great.

Rather than mining the assets, Franco-Nevada provides upfront capital to mining firms in exchange for either a percentage of sales (royalty) or a cut of the physical precious metals (streaming). To be fair, the metals industry represents a volatile sector. However, the fear trade could bolster FNV.One factor to consider of course is that Franco-Nevada ranks among the cash-rich stocks. According to its latest earnings report (Q3 2022), the company had $1.06 billion in cash. Notably, its total liabilities count measured only $192 million. Moreover, Franco-Nevada was FCF positive to the tune of $229 million.Operationally, the company enjoys substantial strengths. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 22.7%, outpacing 82.91% of its peers. Further, its net margin pings at 57.14%, above nearly 95% of the underlying segment.Lastly, Wall Street analysts peg FNV as a consensus hold. However, their average price target stands at $154.29, implying nearly 24% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

What do you know about this?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, it's kind of interesting. They said in the last earnings call, the CFO and Mary Barra, CEO, said they were not going to lay anyone off. And they're saying this isn't a layoff. This is just a, quote, [LAUGHS] ""low performance""--DAVE BRIGGS: Just a long vacation, what?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: ""Performance calibration"" is what they're calling it. So this came after their reviews, I guess. And they're saying, hey, we're letting go some people, about 100 people. It's less than 1% of the salary workforce. So they're couching it as that. But it looks like a layoff to everyone else on the outside world.SEANA SMITH: Is this something that they've done in the past, do you know?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Not that I know of in terms of, like, everyday normal attrition and getting rid of low performance. So they're saying that's what happened. But look at Ford. Almost 4,000 layoffs in Europe they're going to do. And then even Stellantis, they're idling a plant in Belvidere, Illinois, where they build the Cherokee. They're idling that plant. That's almost over 1,500 workers that would potentially lose their jobs. So it's not as bad as other places, but it's happening.DAVE BRIGGS: Ford stock up about 2%. GM about flat on the day.

They will be departing the company starting from today,” Arden Hoffman, chief people officer at GM, wrote in an internal memo sent to employees on Tuesday, reviewed by Fortune. News of the job reductions was first reported Tuesday by The Detroit News.The total number of job reductions may number around 500, CNBC reported Tuesday, citing a person familiar with the plans. A GM spokesperson declined to confirm to Fortune the specific number of job reductions, but said they constituted a “relatively small” share of the company’s 81,000 global employees.The internal announcement echoed statements made by company executives during GM’s fourth-quarter earnings call in January. CEO Mary Barra and CFO Paul Jacobson said at the time that the company was embarking on a $2 billion cost-cutting plan over the next two years to streamline operations and improve efficiency, up to half of which was planned for 2023. However, at the time Jacobsen said that GM was “not doing layoffs” as part of this plan.Story continuesAuto industry’s efficiency pushJob reductions at GM and its larger cost-cutting measures are likely the first of many changes at the company as it attempts to set itself up for success in the years ahead.A GM spokesperson told Fortune Wednesday that “2023 is a critically important year for GM. We are executing multiple global product launches that will shape our company and industry for decades to come.”Part of the reason behind GM’s push to streamline operations and cut costs is to stay competitive with other companies, as the car industry as a whole sets out on a path to make significant changes.“We are looking at all the ways of addressing efficiency and performance,” Hoffman wrote in Tuesday’s memo, adding that the company required a larger “culture shift” that would improve performances and enable GM to keep up with other carmakers.“In an environment where our competitors’ margins are improving, it's imperative that we act now and focus on our own efficiency,” he said. “Working together, we are going to win.”Ford, another stalwart of American automaking, is pursuing a similar path of cost-cutting and efficiency-seeking. Ford laid off around 3,000 employees worldwide last August, and during its earnings call last month, CFO John Lawler said the company has drafted a cost-saving plan worth $3 billion a year, with two thirds of that coming down to streamlined operational costs.Ford’s fourth-quarter earnings were below expectations and reported a net loss for 2022, which the company attributed to “execution issues” hampering operations. Ford CEO Jim Farley hinted at more layoffs in a February interview with SiriusXM, while expressing concern over the company’s ability to keep up with other car companies.“It takes us 25% more engineers to do the same work statements as our competitors,” he said. “I can’t afford to be 25% less efficient.”Unlike Ford, GM reported record earnings last month. But both companies as well as their competitors around the world—including Volkswagen, Nissan, and Honda—are steeling themselves for a more cutthroat business environment in the years ahead as carmakers race to accelerate their electric vehicle plans.GM may be further ahead than Ford, its main domestic competitor, in this respect. Last month, the company agreed on a $650 million investment in a company planning a new mine in Nevada above the country’s largest known reserve of lithium, a critical component in electric vehicle batteries. Also last month, GM announced it would spend $35 billion more than planned between now and 2025 on speeding up EV launches, implying that it was prepared to sacrifice short-term profits to accelerate EV rollouts.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeHow to save money in 7 easy steps The best boarding schools: where the world's elite are sending their kidsThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home]"

SAF is being made from used cooking oil and agricultural waste, and, in the future, could be made from other feedstocks including household trash or forest waste.† To date, United has invested in the future production of over three billion gallons of SAF – the most of any airline in the world.*Consumers can take action too – in a first among U.S. airlines, United now shows an estimate of each flight's carbon footprint on a per economy seat passenger basis on its app and website, and travelers have the option to contribute to supplement United's investment in the UAV Sustainable Flight Fund, a first-of-its-kind investment vehicle designed to support start-ups focused on decarbonizing air travel by accelerating the research, production and technologies associated with SAF.Story continues""United has invested in more sustainable aviation fuel production than any airline in the world, by far,"" said United Chief Communications Officer Josh Earnest.

Creative highlights include:Film Series: Across multiple videos, United highlights Oscar's work in his new role, such as a ""BINtro"" film showcasing his first day on the job.

In addition to the UAV Sustainable Flight Fund, United has launched a SAF purchasing program called the Eco-Skies Alliance and established a venture fund – United Airlines Ventures – to identify and invest in companies and technologies that can decarbonize air travel. These strategic investments include carbon capture, hydrogen-electric engines, electric regional aircraft and air taxis.The Federal Government Recognizes the Value of SAFThe 2022 Inflation Reduction Act includes the largest governmental climate change investments in U.S. history - a new blender's tax credit specifically for SAF along with other critical incentives for clean energy and carbon capture – that will help spur an increase in SAF infrastructure and supply while lowering costs for SAF consumers.The U.S. military currently uses nearly five billion gallons of jet fuel annually and the Department of Defense will use a jet fuel blend containing at least 10% SAF by 2028 because of the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act.And according to the U.S. Department of Energy, the country's vast feedstock resources are enough to meet the projected SAF demand of the entire U.S. aviation industry.About UnitedUnited's shared purpose is ""Connecting People.

PNC also celebrates Black History Month, but its support for Black communities, organizations and individuals extends far beyond the month.""Diversity, equity and inclusion is part of the fabric of PNC,"" says Richard Bynum, chief corporate responsibility officer. ""It has long been at the heart of how we run our business and has guided our efforts around economic empowerment.""PNC's relationships with national and neighborhood organizations represent just one example of how the bank supports the preservation of Black history, while also providing invaluable education and hope for brighter futures.A few of the premiere PNC-supported community treasures shared their stories of how they are working to keep Black history and culture accessible to all.Atlanta, National Center for Civil and Human RightsPNC's relationship with the National Center for Civil and Human Rights (NCCHR) traces back to 2013 when the bank's Tax Credit Solutions team allocated $11 million in New Markets Tax Credits to help finance the Center's construction.Over the years, PNC has supported the museum and human rights educational institution by sponsoring programs that create dynamic and empathy-building experiences that also teach about history's connection to the present.Atlanta, a city steeped in civil rights history and the birthplace of Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., is home to the center, which connects the U.S. civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s to global human rights movements for people of color, women, immigrants, those with disabilities, LGBTQ+ people and other marginalized communities.""We are excited to welcome visitors to celebrate and reflect on this history of bravery and resistance,"" says Jill Savitt, NCCHR president and CEO. ""Black History Month is an ideal time to look back at the lives and examples of iconic and unsung activists for strength and insight as we confront persistent modern oppression.""Story continuesMore recent Black history and heritage programming has included a timeline activity for children and families and a mural creation of the late civil rights legend and longtime congressman Rep. John Lewis (D-Georgia). Musical and dance performances and a conversation with civil rights activist Ambassador Andrew Young also have been a part of events celebrating Black history and heritage at the center. Young, also a former Atlanta mayor, served as a leader of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and marched with MLK during the 1950s and 1960s.""We are grateful to the PNC Foundation for providing support and resources to enrich our programs to inspire folks on all different levels and walks of life to engage in thoughtful conversations about race, equity and justice,"" Savitt says.Chicago, DuSable Black History Museum and Education CenterPNC and the DuSable Museum of African American History, the oldest independent African American history museum in the nation, have maintained a relationship that spotlights the richness of Black history and culture.One of the museum's key tenets is to treat every month as Black History Month, encouraging an unlimited curiosity that pushes the significance of Black history year-round.Over the years PNC has supported celebrations of Black history and heritage through educational programs and exhibits.DuSable Museum President and CEO Perri Irmer believes education can help with the lack of empathy that is sometimes still displayed regarding the historical impact on Black lives.""It's important to understand that Black history is not only American history, but world history,"" Irmer says. ""Black lives and Black experiences are integral to understanding the world we live in today and deserve to be more than a footnote in history. The work we do here corrects centuries of misinformation and minimization. We are expanding on incomplete curriculums and reclaiming the narrative to make our history more accurate and more accessible.""To provide that education, the DuSable Museum offers tours, webcasts, learning opportunities and performances to ensure important stories are still being told.PNC has helped enrich thought-provoking, socially relevant experiences for visitors of all ages, through more than $500,000 in philanthropic contributions to the museum as well as through advocacy, including support for ""The March"" a virtual remake of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s 1963 March on Washington for jobs and freedom.""The history of Black lives and the history of the world are inseparable,"" Irmer says. ""You can't unweave the cloth. You can't tell one story without the other.""Cleveland, Karamu HouseFor almost 106 years, Karamu House has supported the local community by activating its mission to produce professional theater, provide arts education and present community programs for all people while honoring the African American experience.America's oldest-producing Black theater, which was originally founded as a settlement house, is a community institution serving as a common ground for people of different racial, religious and socioeconomic backgrounds.PNC continues to show support for Karamu House and has sponsored theatre series, arts education programs and annual fundraising events that help Karamu further its mission in the community.Tony F. Sias, president and CEO of Karamu House, also believes the African American experience is often misunderstood or left out of history entirely.He says the PNC relationship gives Karamu the ability to serve more individuals in the community and to reach larger audiences for greater impact.""When we understand who has been left out of the conversation and the consequences of their exclusion, we can draw a straight line toward solutions to include them moving forward. Thus, the preservation of true history advances racial equity for all,"" Sias says.Greater Washington, National Museum of African American History and CultureIn 2019, PNC donated $1 million to the National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC), a Smithsonian Institution museum that explores American history through the lens of the African American experience. The donation is designed to cover operational costs over five years, but for PNC, the partnership is much more meaningful.""Given the relatively short life of the museum, its presence and reach are setting a new standard for meeting the deep demand to reconcile American history with the realities that have faced the American people,"" says Bynum, who also serves on the corporate council for the museum.NMAAHC's Talking about Race initiative, a portal dedicated to providing tools and guidance to inspire conversations about race, gives parents, educators and others a foundation to learn, reflect and move forward.The museum also has been documenting the marches and rallies that have shaped the country's discourse around racial justice, leading courageous conversations through virtual summits and placing historic election years in the greater context of the struggle for voting rights and political representation.Creating a better future through educationBynum believes the museums and community institutions that PNC supports provide a lens to evaluate issues that will shape or inform the future - a future that has long been a focus for PNC employees, the communities it serves and shareholders.""Whatever your background, whatever your ethnicity, this is an American story about people who have persevered through trials and hardships and whose story has become, in many cases, the culture of America,"" says Bynum.Read MoreBlack History &amp; HeritageLearn how PNC celebrates historical Black achievements and culture.The PNC Financial Services Group, Wednesday, March 1, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from The PNC Financial Services Group on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: The PNC Financial Services GroupWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/pnc-financial-services-groupEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: The PNC Financial Services GroupView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/741571/PNC-Partners-Preserve-Black-History-Across-Communities]"
230,22882c99-08fc-329e-abed-84e345cea56a,PNC,2023-03-02,16 High Growth Non-Tech Stocks That Are Profitable,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/16-high-growth-non-tech-190901202.html,1677697741,STORY,"['MSCI', 'PNC', 'NEE-PR', 'BX', 'CTAS', 'COST', 'ADP', 'SPGI']","[In this article, we take a look at 16 high growth non-tech stocks that are profitable. If you want to see more high growth non-tech stocks that are profitable, go directly to 5 High Growth Non-Tech Stocks That Are Profitable.High growth stocks can have various definitions. For this article, we define high growth as a company where analysts expect the company to grow its EPS by an average annual rate of at least 10% over the next 5 years.High growth stocks can oftentimes be riskier than blue chip stocks because much of their value is in the future and depends on future growth. If high growth stocks' growth rate slows more than expected, the market could value the perceived value in the future lower.Although many high growth stocks are tech stocks, there are also many high growth stocks in other sectors that aren't in technology.Companies try to grow their earnings in various ways. Some companies buy back a lot of their stock to try to generate more EPS growth if their earnings are relatively stable. Other companies try to acquire the right companies for growth. Yet other companies try to expand organically by developing new products or services or expanding into new markets.Sometimes those growth efforts work and sometimes they don't. When they do work, some companies that are successful in making new profitable products, buying back their stock at the right times, and buying the right companies can grow their earnings faster than 10% a year.The Economic CycleAn average company's growth rate can vary depending on where the economy is in the economic cycle. If the economy is strong and growing, the average EPS growth rate might be a little faster than if an economy is weak and potentially contracting.In terms of where the economy is currently in the economic cycle, it isn't clear where the economy is. Although unemployment is low and the economy is growing, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to continue to raise interest rates. If the central bank raises rates too much, there could be an economic slowdown.Story continuesIn 2022, the growth of many high growth stocks in the technology sector slowed fairly considerably in part due to the rise in interest rates. The valuation of many big tech companies decreased as a result of capital moving from the equity market into the U.S. Treasury market given the interest rate increases.Comparatively, many other non-tech sectors did a little better than the tech sector in 2022 because their valuations weren't as high or weren't as dependent on growth rates.If the future increases in interest rates cause a recession or a substantial economic slowdown, however, the valuations in non tech sectors could also come under pressure. An economic slowdown or recession could negatively affect earnings growth rates of companies in both technology and non technology sectors. It could also affect the future expected earnings growth rates for the next 5 years as well.As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.MethodologyFor our list of 16 High Growth Non-Tech Stocks That Are Profitable, we selected 16 stocks with competitive advantages in sectors other than technology that have an EPS next 5 year ratio of over 10% according to FINVIZ.com.EPS Next 5 Year Ratio is the estimated average annual EPS growth rate in the next 5 years.Given EPS Next 5 Year Ratio is an estimate, it can change from time to time depending on economic events, company specific events, and analyst view changes.We ranked the stocks based on their EPS next 5 year ratio according to FINVIZ.com.We also included trailing twelve month net income data from YCharts.Because we used net income data from YCharts, the net income data might not be adjusted and it could be over different time periods since different companies have different fiscal years.For those of you interested, check out 10 High Growth Low Dividend Stocks to Buy.16 High Growth Non-Tech Stocks That Are Profitable16.

I'd like to start by welcoming the investors and others who are attending this meeting remotely and of course we're happy that so many of you have joined us here in person today. Before I turn it over to Brian to start the meeting, I have a couple of important disclosures. First, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings. And second, in today's remarks, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are included in our financial press releases, financial presentations, and SEC filings, which are posted on our Investor Relations website. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian to begin the meeting.Brian Cornell: Well, good morning and thank you for joining us. Looking forward to spending this time with you. We're eager to share our plans, including how we'll continue to grow, how we'll continue to rebuild profitability on that growth, and how we'll strengthen our business in conditions that have changed a lot, since we gathered here at the Time Center last year. At that time, we had just passed a crucial milestone. We had just become a $106 billion company. For the full year 2022, which we're reporting today, we placed another $3.1 billion of revenue growth on top of that growth. We grew traffic by 2.1%. We gained unit share across our core merchandising categories, which means that consumers were constrained by inflation and have to be very selective about where they shop and what they buy, continue shopping and buying at Target and despite difficulties throughout the year, we close the books on 2022 with our 23rd straight quarter of comp sales growth.Story continuesHowever, the path between last year's Time Center meeting and this one was anything but predictable. When we last gathered here, New York was still under a mass mandate, and though although consumers had started moving towards post-pandemic behaviors, with families returning to travel and restaurants and shifting some dollars out of retail, we are just beginning to see how volatile and uncertain 2022 would become. As spiraling inflation forced families to put discretionary purchases on hold and focus most of their spending on necessities and there was a rapid escalation to the most expensive operating environment we've seen in decades, all of which was made worse by the spike in fuel prices caused by Russia's war on Ukraine. Those variables and many others continue to have a profound effect on the retail landscape.So this morning we want to take stock of that situation. We want to speak clearly about Target's planning to stay on our growth path for the years ahead. We're keeping this morning's agenda very focused on our strategy, operations, growth investments and financial expectations. We see this as a time to combine steady leadership with our long-term strategy and a continued focus on agility and strong focus on retail fundamentals. Our goals this morning are to show you how we're navigating near-term challenges, how the durability of our business model lies in its flexibility. We'll share what we're prioritizing to stay in step with our guest and how we'll flex across our multi-category portfolio, which means in the near term, leaning into growth in non-discretionary categories.We'll also reinforce how the trust and loyalty we've built with our guests shows in our traffic and share gains. Given value is absolutely top of mind right now, being able to deliver affordable joy differentiates us in the marketplace and that's a clear advantage in the near term and remains our focus over the long term. With those factors in mind, we also want to use this time to set clear and realistic expectations. Social shareholders and stakeholders can track what progress looks like in 2023. Taking a step back, I might start by recognizing that our growth in '22 didn't come easily. It wasn't nearly as profitable as we expected to be over time. In 2020 and 2021, our team put in the effort and the hustle to keep pace with the most turbulent business environment many of us have ever seen.They brought the expertise and excellence to take the company to a new level, but while we gain incredible scale by continue to prioritize our guests, I acknowledge we're still developing some of the tools to marshal that scale efficiently. Yet as we think about what growth looks like from here, it's helpful to anchor back to what we were saying at yearend 2019. At that time, we were putting up proof points on a strategy that was and still is unique in retail, when we built to reliably deliver low single digit increases in sales year after year. It started by investing in our team, in part because we believe human interaction is the key to growth in a digital age. As we move into 2023, we'll continue to support our team and lean into our culture, knowing they're at the heart of our overall success.The 2019 strategy puts stores at the center of everything because when we remodeled or added a store and improved the guest experience, comp grew. At the same time, turning stores into fulfillment hubs was and still is the most efficient and least costly way to grow omnichannel sales. As you'll hear today, we're not standing still on our store remodel and expansion plans or investments in a bigger supply chain or ongoing improvements in digital. It's no surprise that 100% of our store sales are fulfilled by stores, but in our case, more than 95% of all sales, including digital, are too. Since 2019, our store base has only grown slightly, but total sales grew nearly 40% in that timeframe. Our digital business nearly tripled in size and our sales per square foot increased by 37% and fulfilling substantially all that growth through essentially the same asset base was nothing short of incredible on the part of our team.So as we hold on to those gains and look to put growth on top of them, we'll continue to invest, in stores in supply chain, in digital, through our stores as hubs model. Our 2019 strategy prioritize the differentiation and profit performance of an own brand portfolio that is simply unmatched in retail. At the same time, we're curating national brands our guests love, and in 2019 we had just started our premier partnerships with Levi's and Disney. Since then, both those partnerships have expanded as a partnerships with Apple and Starbucks and as you know, we're in the middle of building out an incredibly exciting partnership with Ulta Beauty. Meanwhile, our team has built on our position of strength in own brands, adding 17 of them since 2019.That includes two more billion plus dollar brands in good and gather and all in motion, but we're not slowing down with own brands. In fact, just the opposite. As you'll hear from Christina, we're planning a steady cadence of newness in own brands and national brands across our multi-category portfolio in the year ahead. What else within the 2019 strategy? Well, that was a year we introduced Target Circle. At that time it was a powerful new asset for guest engagement, personalization, loyalty and sales that quickly attracted 50 million users. Since 2019, the user base has doubled and has still growing meaningfully and Circle has become the heart of our increasingly connected loyalty ecosystem. Since 2019, our media company Roundel has grown significantly, with great additional growth and profit potential on the horizon.It's sought after by advertisers for its relevance and reach and it's growing each year because our guests appreciate the engagement and the value it delivers. Roundel makes for a more deeply engaged guest and partners, and because it gives us better understanding of our guest preferences, it makes us an even better and more profitable retailer. So we intend to place additional emphasis and investment towards Circle and Roundel in 2023, given the growth potential they'll unlock. So let's pause here and I'll start to put all this together. While I'm deliberately drawing a connection between 2019 and the year ahead, there's one giant difference. We're starting 2023 on a revenue base of $109 billion, not the $78 billion we had back then. There are other big differences too.Today we're reporting a full year comp increase in the low single digits similar to 2019 and unit shared gains across all five of our core merchandising categories. But unlike 2019, our three year revenue growth is $30 plus billion, not just $8 billion, and our digital penetration now stands at nearly 19%. During the pandemic, guests became more attached to Target, and as we deepen engage with guests, more moved into the ranks of our most engaged, measured by spend, trips and cross-category purchases. Guest engagement is also reflected in a significant increase in transactions since 2019. In fact, those increases started as far back as 2017 and we're positioned to keep growing engagement levels across our guest base, even as we focus on expanding that base overall.So standing here today, my sense is that a new normal is on the horizon. It'll be much more like 2019 than the last three years, and as we plan prudently to invest in 2023, we see a return over time to solid and consistent growth with operating income margin rate that should move towards and to begin to move beyond our pre-pandemic rate of 6% in the next few years. Today we'll show you our work for how we arrived at that conclusion, but a spoiler alert, it starts with a strategy. You've seen it many times before and while the facets on this slide haven't changed, we're prioritizing to accelerate key growth drivers and making changes that will help us respond to the short-term environment while continuing to advance all elements of our strategy.They all work together to keep our growth trajectory rolling. Christina will cover that in greater detail, including the focus this year we're placing on the magic of Target on affordable joy and on digital growth Target Circle, Roundel and our enterprise sustainability strategy Target Forward. Then John will cover what we're learning from an ongoing operational evolution, what we're testing, what we're in the process of optimizing, what benefits we see from the standpoint of efficiency as we continue to scale. Michael will describe how we're planning cautiously and we believe appropriately given the economic challenges we anticipate this year. But caution doesn't mean cut-off from continued growth and progress. In fact, some of the most exciting progress we anticipate will be translating our newfound scale in a simpler, more efficient way is to run Target.The difference between an enterprise-wide efficiency mindset and a cost cutting program starts with what questions you ask yourself. For us, the question isn't what can we cut? It's how do we make things easier for our team to more efficiently deliver a guest experience that continues to live up our brand -- to our brand promise. So we'll invite Michael O'Neal, the leader we tap to coordinate these efforts across Target to offer his perspective on efficiency. What it is, what it isn't, how we can drive continuous improvement and what we can unlock with this focus. We're looking forward to the next hour or so. We recognize that the landscape is unpredictable and there are plenty of near term challenges on the horizon. We believe 2023 will be a year in which the durable model allows us to flex up the categories and the value proposition that are most relevant to our guests today.We'll double down on execution. So our guests get all they've been promised every time they turn to target. And we'll stay focused on gaining share across our portfolio. Underpinning all that with the work we're doing around efficiency, to provide fuel for longer-term growth. We're optimistic about what this team can deliver and realistic about how 2023 will keep challenging us to be agile, resilient and responsive for our guests, our communities, for each other and for our shareholders. Before we leave here today, our goal is to take you along. So you can see exactly what we're seeing. And with that, let's get going.Christine Leahy: Thanks, Brian. Despite the challenges of the past year, Target's differentiated position in retail has never been stronger, with a great assortment, compelling value, an unmatched suite of fulfillment options and a joyful shopping experience, Target continues to drive preference with American shoppers in the face of a turbulent economic and consumer backdrop. We have continually adapted to the environment around us, delivering ease, value and inspiration to our guests all the time when daily doses of joy are needed more than ever. And amidst this volatility, we continue to hone the foundational elements that it takes to be a long-term winner in retail. Fourth quarter comparable sales grew 0.7% on top of nearly 9% last year.And for the full year, comparable sales grew 2.2% on top of nearly 13% in 2021. While our business has been generating growth on top of growth for years now, the mix of last year's sales looked vastly different than what we had expected. Throughout 2022, changing attitude towards COVID, followed by the pressure from persistent inflation, caused demand for discretionary categories to slow meaningfully. With this in mind, we've taken a cautious approach to this year's inventory commitments in many of these categories. And we're focusing on the agility of our operating model to adjust should sales trends exceed our expectations. In light of the volatility we've experienced, I often get the question, what did Target learn from the past year? What I'll share with you today are some of the lessons learned.In short, we've learned that our strategy is working. At the same time, we've come to further appreciate the importance of strong day-to-day execution, combined with the agility required to react even quicker to changing consumer trends. And of course, last year, reinforced the importance of providing every guest with a great shopping experience. Most of what I'll share today likely won't sound all that different from the playbook we've used for the past few years. That is intentional. For example, our multicategory assortment continues to resonate with our guests, even as consumer demand continuously evolves. The unique balance we've achieved across all five of our core merchandising categories continues to be a key differentiator in the market, with each category serving at times as a trip driver, at other times as a basket builder, and oftentimes as both.Throughout 2022, we saw and continue to see incredible growth in our Food &amp; Beverage and Essentials and Beauty businesses, offsetting a meaningful pullback in discretionary categories like home, apparel and hard lines. But despite this pullback, these discretionary categories still delivered around $55 billion in sales last year. In both our Food &amp; Beverage and Beauty categories, 2022 delivered the third consecutive year of double-digit sales growth, stemming from increases in both traffic and average ticket. And while we're thrilled to have driven unit share gains across all of our major categories last year, we saw the strongest gains in these rapidly growing frequency categories, a proof point of the relevance and value found in these assortments.Target, market, salesPhoto by Marques Thomas on UnsplashIn Beauty, we continue to be a market leader, delivering the highest growth rates of any category we sell. We've been seeing outsized growth across the entire portfolio from everyday beauty assortments to new and exciting offerings like those we've added through our partnership with Ulta Beauty. In fact, last year's sales from Ulta Beauty at Target were more than 4x higher than in 2021, and this growth was almost entirely incremental. As such, we remain excited to continue opening additional Ulta Beauty at Target locations this year and beyond. Of course, we don't build an assortment for a given snapshot in time. Rather, we flex across our categories as consumer demand shifts. And even in tough times, our discretionary assortment provides a unique opportunity to connect with guests in key moments from major life changes, to seasonal celebrations and everyday moments in between.Now I want to be clear that despite our cautious inventory position in discretionary categories, we're still focused on delivering newness throughout the portfolio and placing select bets in businesses where we believe market share opportunities are strongest. That's because despite continued volatility and the path the Target guests are attracted to all things trendy and new. We believe our commitment to newness is a key reason why we continue to generate traffic growth, and why we drove broad unit share gains last year. Our focus on balance can be found within each category as well, where we continue to offer both industry-leading national brands and high-quality affordable owned brands that are unmatched by our competitors. Our owned brands have long been a source of pride and differentiation for Target, offering great style and quality, all at incredible value.So it's no surprise that our owned brands have continued to outpace total enterprise growth and why we have plans to launch new or extend assortments in more than 10 owned brands this year. Recently, a study listing the 10 fastest-growing private label brands in 2022 included three found exclusively at Target. Target was the only retailer to have more than one brand on the list, and two of them were the only nonfood brands to make the cut. Many retailers were not focused on newness in 2022, but the opposite was true at Target, where we continue to excite our guests with innovative and trendy products. For example, we launched Future Collective, a first-of-its-kind apparel owned brand, featuring collections in partnership with a rotating roster of diverse influencers.This innovative approach blending the strength of Target's own brands with the excitement of our limited-time partnerships and collaborations has been a huge success, particularly with Black guests, furthering our commitment to ensure all guests see themselves reflected in our assortments. Most recently, we launched a new line with actor and influencer, Tabitha Brown. Tabitha's energy and passion absolutely shines in this new line, and our guests are loving it. Tabitha serves as the latest example of the endless possibilities that comes from bringing together the incredible talents of diverse designers and the power of Target's multi-category portfolio. Take a look and see what I mean. The passion of these designers is so inspiring. The emotion and pride is palpable, and we love the way that Target magic of these partnerships cut across categories, including last quarter's launch of Marks &amp; Spencer and Tampa has recent extension into food.And while these collaborations offer joy for our guests, recent history has reinforced that focusing on the basics of retail is just as important as the latest innovation or new offering. In fact, nailing the fundamentals is the bedrock of a successful retailer, from the overall shopping experience to ease and convenience, relevance, everyday value and more. Of these fundamentals, we know that a strong and reliable shopping experience is the surest way to build trust and affinity. So we aim to provide a consistent, joyous and easy experience, both in stores and online, making Target a shopping destination, not just a means to an end. To do this, we've invested heavily in new stores, our remodel program and our same-day fulfillment services, as John will highlight shortly.We led the way in comprehensive pay and benefits, attracting and retaining the best team in retail, allowing us to provide a level of service unmatched by our competitors. We've invested in one-of-a-kind brand partnership experiences like those with Levi's, Apple, Disney and Ulta Beauty. And while some of these partnerships are newer, we featured Starbucks in our stores for decades, proof that when we work with iconic brands, we build lasting relationships. With a Starbucks in nearly all of our stores, they have become part of the shopping ritual for many of our guests. In fact, we've served up more than 170 million Starbucks beverages last year alone. A strong digital shopping experience is every bit as important as the one we create in our stores.So we've been investing to ensure that the experience is seamless across every channel, regardless of how our guests shop. Whether searching for an item or browsing for inspiration, we continue to elevate their experience, providing personalized and relevant content using our incredible data and guest insights. This will include more customized homepages, improved search functionality and even more personalized offers from Target Circle. It will also include more relevant content from our digital advertising business, Roundel. Our digital success won't be driven by a single service or offering, but through a comprehensive set of experiences designed to be greater than the sum of the parts. Target Circle is one of the nation's leading loyalty programs with over 100 million members and growing.Through continuous learning and application of guest insights, Target Circle served up 3x more personalized offers in 2022 and Target Circle members spend 3x more on average this past holiday season. We also continue to invest in the tools team and capabilities of Roundel. To us, Roundel is more than a digital advertising platform or another revenue source in the P&amp;L. The goal is for our guests to have a tailored, relevant experience, while helping our vendors reach the guests who are most likely to be interested in their products. Said simply, Roundel makes us better merchants, more consistently serving our guests with the products they want. This is why our approach to digital advertising looks different than others. We put our guests at the center of this strategy, just as we do in every other aspect of our business.It's no wonder we continue to see such explosive digital growth, why Roundel grew by more than 60% over the past two years, and why we'll continue to leverage the risk rich guest insights. And regardless of whether our gas or shopping is online or in store, they are looking for comprehensive value now more than ever. That means offering great everyday prices and promotions and offering quality and inspiration. After all, Target invented affordable joy decades ago and is still a key differentiator in a crowded retail market. Our guests see value in countless ways from our competitively priced and high-quality owned brand offerings to multiple red card benefits, including 5% off on every trip and free shipping for all online orders, all with no annual fee.We offer compelling value at every turn, and we are continuously listening to our guests to understand what value means to them. And beyond these retail basics, we continue to hear from our guests that they prefer shopping with companies who prioritize people and planet. That's why we're so focused on our target forward strategy. This isn't a stand-alone strategy, but rather Target Forward is fully integrated throughout our business, fueling our growth potential, while bettering the world. As part of this strategy, we'll continue to elevate Black voices and brands and are on track to spend $2 billion on Black-owned businesses by 2025. We'll also continue to focus on designing products for a circular future like in our owned brand, Universal Thread, where we are using materials such as recycled cotton and polyester.These are just a few of the countless examples of how we push ourselves and industry partners to grow sustainably. Our purpose is to help all families discover the joy of everyday life, requires a balance of quality, value and innovation that sets us apart from competitors. We are relentless in ensuring every decision supports this delicate balance. It's easy to say, but takes incredible diligence to execute. And while you've heard me say it before, it bears repeating now. We truly have the best team in retail. I'm so grateful for the many efforts of our team to serve our guests and each other, day in and day out. With that, I'll turn things over to John.John Mulligan: Thanks, Christina, and good morning, everyone. So Brian talked about the last few years being unpredictable. To put a finer point on that, if you had told me in late 2020, during the height of the pandemic, that 2022 would be the most challenging operating environment in my career, well, I would have assumed you were joking. Yet shifting consumer preferences, supply chain volatility and rising inflation created a set of conditions that called for flexibility, responsiveness and resilience. Our environment remains volatile, and we expect 2023 will have its own unique set of challenges. But if I've learned anything over the past three years, it's never underestimate the power of a purpose-driven team and the culture they create.2022 offered more examples of Target teamwork than I can count, but two will stick with me for quite a while. Five months ago when Hurricane Ian devastated communities across Florida, our team sprang into action. It didn't wait for me or Brian or anyone else on the leadership team to tell them what to do. Instead, they gathered input from those on the ground and told us what they needed. Pop-up resource centers that provided laundry, food, gas, restroom, showers and Wi-Fi-enabled laptops to 700 team members in their families. Extra inventory to stock local stores with essentials guests would need to weather the storm, and financial support, $5 million to fund local relief efforts and up to $3 million in matching donations to our team member giving fund, which provides assistance to team members affected by natural disasters.It was about the same time that our inventory action plan was in full swing. You'll remember, we announced bold measures last summer to quickly take action to rightsize our inventory in response to shifting consumer demands. This is a big ask of our team, one that required them to move quickly and aggressively to reduce existing inventory and cut back on receipts for the back half of 2022. And the team responded as they always do with heart and hustle. They worked through 8 distribution centers worth of inventory in a matter of months, putting us in a strong position heading into the critical holiday season. That's our culture in action, bottom-up ingenuity, centered on caring for our team and our guests. And it's that culture that fuels our strategy and growth.For years now, we've shared our vision of using our stores as fulfillment hubs to get closer to our guests. It was an idea that was novel when we first introduced it, but it's been widely adopted as others expand their view of what stores can do. I'm an engineer to my core. So it gives me great satisfaction to see the way Target built our stores as hub strategy from the ground up and how our operating model gets stronger with each passing year. We don't have a rigid road map. Instead, we use a highly repeatable process to test concepts, refine them, test them again until we can replicate them with confidence, efficiency and scale. And then and only then do we ask ourselves what's next? And how can we make this even better? And the whole process begins again.Let's take Drive-Up. You can trace the origins of Drive-Up to the launch of our store pickup service a decade ago. It took a few years to get store pickup where we wanted. And when we did, we were able to take it one step further with Drive-Up. We launched Drive-Up as a test in our Minneapolis market in 2017. By the following year, the service was available in more than 1,000 stores around the country, and it reached all 50 states in 2019. With the foundation in place and operating at scale, we started to explore new capabilities. In 2020, we made fresh and frozen groceries available. In 2021, we added adult beverage and expanded our app to give guests a more customized experience. Last year, we began testing Starbucks at Drive-Up. And today, we're announcing the next phase of our Drive-Up services with drive up returns, which started as a pilot last year and will be available across the chain by the end of the summer.Not only is this a huge one for our guests who can now do even more at Drive-Up, but it brings more efficiency to our returns process, with more resale opportunities and fewer expenses for mail and returns. We're combining the strength of our digital self-service returns process with our industry-leading Drive-Up experience to meet our guests where they are. This is what it means to be a truly omnichannel retailer, giving our guests the flexibility, ease and convenience to shop the way that works best for them and scaling capabilities across every facet of our business. online, in-store, Drive-Up, it doesn't matter how they choose to shop with us. We're here to make their Target run better than ever. Looking back, the evolution of Drive-Up may seem like it was a natural progression, easy to predict and implement.But you're bringing to market new ideas in an environment that is anything but stable, you have to be ready to adjust course and explore alternatives. Our team has gotten really good at moving in step with the needs of our guests. That flexibility and a commitment to the fundamentals that make or break a retailer, things like hiring the right people, offering the right products and delivering the right experiences to our guests, underpin our store as hub strategy and contribute to our larger story of growth. Same-day services like Drive-Up are a great example. They grew nearly 7% last year as more shoppers appreciate the convenience and speed with which they can check off everything on their list. And because we own our same-day capabilities, pickup and Drive-Up are much more economical and flexible than other forms of digital fulfillment.In fact, our average fulfillment cost per unit has come down 40% over the past four years as our same-day services have grown to account for over half of our digital sales. Again, these results don't happen overnight, and they aren't achieved in a vacuum. They are the product of steady investment and listening to our guests. Take our stores, which sit at the heart of our stores as hub strategy and play a dual role of shopping destination and fulfilment hub. Our stores are not only beautiful, with open floor design, plenty of natural light and design elements that reflect the communities they serve. They're built to keep inventory moving through our system and support Target's trajectory of growth. Late last year, we introduced a new store prototype in Katy, Texas.From the front entrance to the back room, this 150,000 square foot store is a stunner. Beautiful design elements reflect the local environment and community. Features like natural refrigerants, electric vehicle charging stations and rooftop solar empower our Target Forward sustainability ambitions and get us closer to our goal of net zero emissions by 2040. And a backroom 5x bigger than our average store allows us to ramp up same-day fulfillment, while preserving a seamless experience for our guests and our team. We plan to open about 20 stores this year in a mix of sizes from the shores of the outer banks in North Carolina to the heart of Inglewood, California. We're also planning to invest in about 175 stores throughout the year, ranging from full remodels to the addition of shop-in-shop experiences like Ulta Beauty and retrofitted fulfillment spaces to support our same-day services.Our ongoing investment in our suite of stores is just one way we're building for the future. What might be less evident to our guests is how we're building facilities behind the scenes to make their experience even better. We built upstream capacity by opening flow centers in Chicago and New Jersey, with several more slated to open over the next few years. And a new food distribution center that opened in Maryland this past October expand support for our growing food and beverage business. This additional capacity gives us more flexibility to manage inventory and keep our stores stocked with the items guests want when they want them. We're also making investments downstream. Earlier this month, we announced the expansion of our sortation center network to more than 15 facilities by the end of 2026.These facilities have transformed how we move inventory with speed and precision to guests' doorsteps. We started with a prototype less than two years ago to see how we might bring more efficiency to how we sort, batch and route packages. Today, we have nine sortation centers open across the country, allowing us to deliver packages to guests within two days. Up to 40% are delivered one day when using our last-mile delivery capabilities was shipped. And because Shipt is fully integrated into our last-mile operations, we benefit from significantly lower delivery costs. To give you a closer look at how these sortation centers have become core to our business, we ask leaders from Target and Shipt to give you a brief tour and talk about how our test and learn approach applies to last-mile delivery.Let's take a look.John Mulligan: As you heard from Dori, Sad and Comau, we've learned a lot over the past few years, using every opportunity to improve speed, cost and quality. And in regards, our sortation centers are just hitting their stride. We delivered more than 25 million packages through sortation centers last year, and we expect to double that amount in 2023 with the help of our local and national carriers. Together, the investments we're making create a more nimble sourcing, inventory management and fulfilment capability at Target, and they continue to help us navigate tough times, prepare for the unpredictable and fuel steady growth, all thanks to our incredible team. We've made huge strides in recent years to connect with our guests through our stores. The momentum continues to build, and I look forward to sharing progress with you and our guests in the quarters to come. Michael, I'll turn it over to you.See also 15 Biggest Airplane Manufacturing Companies in the World and 15 Biggest Payment Companies in the World.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here&gt;&gt;&gt;Here are the key points:For the 489 S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported Q4 results, total earnings are down -5.8% from the same period last year on +5.8% higher revenues, with 70.8% beating EPS estimates and 70.3% beating revenue estimates.Looking at 2022 Q4 as a whole, aggregate S&amp;P 500 earnings are currently expected to be down -5.6% on +5.8% higher revenues. Excluding the Energy sector’s strong contribution, Q4 earnings for the rest of the index would be down -9.5% on +4.9% higher revenues.For 2023 Q1, S&amp;P 500 earnings are currently expected to be down -9.0% on +2.0% higher revenues. This is down from -4% on January 6th and -2.9% in mid-December 2022.Earnings estimates for full-year 2023 have been coming down as well. From their peak in mid-April 2022, the aggregate total for the year has been cut by -12.4% for the index as a whole and -14.5% excluding the Energy sector’s contribution.The 2022 Q4 reporting cycle has effectively come to an end, with results from traditional retailers as the only remaining point of interest. With Walmart WMT, Target TGT, Home Depot HD and a number of other major retailers already out with their results, we have a good sense of how the Q4 earnings season unfolded even for the Retail space.The market liked the Walmart and Target reports, even though they provided weak(ish) guidance. The favorable reception for the results reflected appreciation for management execution in a tough operating environment. This is particularly so with Walmart, on the back of good inventory management and continued market share gains that partly drove the strong comparable sales growth during the holidays.Story continuesThe market likely sees the weak guidance from Walmart and Target as reflective of conservatism on management’s part. We don’t see anything wrong with this interpretation, particularly since we find ourselves in the so-called soft-landing camp. Simply put, Walmart’s guidance reflects a degree of moderation and weakness in the consumer that is somewhat at odds with a less-worrisome macroeconomic outcome.Regular readers know that we have a distinct stand-alone sector for the Retail sector, unlike the (official) Standard &amp; Poor’s GICS that houses retailers in the Consumer Discretionary and Consumer Staples sectors. We feel that our dedicated Retail sector classification allows us a more nuanced appreciation of evolving trends, but you will justifiably call our views on the subject as biased.The Zacks Retail sector is a fairly broad grouping that not only includes the likes of Walmart and Home Depot, but also digital players like Amazon AMZN and restaurant operators. All of these digital and restaurant players have already reported their Q4 results, with mostly the traditional players still to come at this stage.We have included a full scorecard of the Zacks Retail sector in the body of this report.The Earnings Big PictureFor the current period (2023 Q1), S&amp;P 500 earnings are currently expected to decline -9.0% from the same period last year on +2.0% higher revenues.As has been the case over the few quarters, estimates for 2023 Q1 have been steadily coming down.Please note that the magnitude of cuts to Q1 estimates is relatively lower compared to what we saw in the comparable periods for the last few quarters.As noted earlier, the current aggregate earnings total for the index approximates to an index ‘EPS’ of $215.75, up slightly vs. last week’s $215.65, but down big from $242.98 in mid-April, 2022.Expectations for the Coming PeriodsEarnings this year are now expected to be down -0.3%. This can hardly be called out-of-sync with a flat or even modestly down economic growth outlook. Don’t forget that headline GDP growth numbers are in real or inflation-adjusted terms while S&amp;P 500 earnings discussed here are not.As mentioned earlier, 2023 aggregate earnings estimates on an ex-Energy basis are already down by more than -14% since mid-April 2022. Perhaps we see a bit more downward adjustments to estimates over the coming weeks, after more companies report Q4 results and provide guidance along the lines of what we saw with Microsoft. But we have nevertheless already covered some ground in taking estimates to a fair or appropriate level.This is particularly so if whatever economic downturn lies ahead proves to be more of the garden variety rather than the last two such events. Recency bias forces us to use the last two economic downturns, which were also among the nastiest in recent history, as our reference points. But we need to be cautious against that natural tendency as the economy’s foundations at present remain unusually strong.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

They're remaining cautious as inflation weighs on consumers. Kohl's and Lowe's out with their earnings this morning. They're both aligning on the same theme of more caution ahead.Let's dive into the retail earnings and the state of the consumer with Jharonne Martis, Refinitiv's director of consumer research. Jharonne, good to see you. Speaking of retail, what a cool dress you have on.Let's talk about the caution that we're hearing, right, because it's not just Lowe's and Kohl's this morning. We got it from Home Depot. We got it from Walmart. We got it from Target. Given that the numbers right now look pretty good for some of these companies, why so much caution? What's going to go wrong as the year goes on?JHARONNE MARTIS: As you mentioned, Julie-- good morning. Yes, it's not just Lowe's. It's also Ross. It's Target. It's a number of companies who are warning us not to expect too much from them, and this is mainly because the theme this earnings season is inflation. About 146 retailers have already reported, and over 90% have mentioned inflation during their earnings call, and they're warning us not to expect too much from them. They've been very conservative on their guidance for the first quarter.In fact, for every positive guidance we've received, we've received seven negative guidance preannouncements, and this is the highest negative to positive-- the weakest negative-to-positive ratio that we've seen in over a year now, mainly because of the uncertainty of the macroeconomic factors and where inflation might be headed for the rest of the year. As a result, earnings expectations have been lowered for the full year for 2023 and also for the first quarter.Story continuesBRAD SMITH: For some of these companies, and especially for Target and Walmart, Jharonne-- and great to see you-- it's really about the discretionary categories that they've taken a hit in. Where do you see either further pricing mechanisms that they're going to have to roll out and that perhaps continuing to impact some of their margins just in order to clear out old inventory in the apparel, electronics, the home categories as well?JHARONNE MARTIS: So there's different dynamics to your question, Brad. Good morning. So first off, because of the inflation, the value proposition is key to the consumer. The consumer will only open up their wallets if they feel that they're getting a good price or a good discount. So in a collaboration with Centraprise and Refinitiv discovered that the average promotion rose in the month of January, which is what helped bring in a lot of that traffic that we're telling-- that we're seeing that retailers are telling us that they saw in the month of January.But already companies like Urban Outfitters are giving us a glimpse of February, and we're seeing that the traffic already decreased. So number one, yes, there's going to be a lot of promotions in order to move that inventory, which we're already seeing is hurting gross profit margins.Then there's the value proposition. Consumers are trading down, and as a result, we're seeing that the dollar stores are benefiting the most. Groceries, Target, and Walmart are the main sectors that are helping offset a lot of the weakness of discretionary spending.But then also we're seeing that the dollar stores knocked it out of the park today, and this is because the low-end consumer is gainfully employed. There's high demand for their employment. They feel good about their job security. And as a result, the dollar stores are expanding their stores in a time when a lot of the other retailers are struggling. As a result, the dollar stores posted some of the strongest same-store sales we've seen, even before prepandemic levels.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, which makes sense given what we're seeing from the consumer, although we are seeing those Dollar Tree shares slip a little bit. One company that sort of stands out here as not showing strength despite being, one could argue, on the value end of the spectrum is Kohl's, right? The company's same-store sales fell 6.6%. That's more than estimated. The forecast for the full year, I mean, even given that we've had a lot of negative forecasts, this one is pretty bad. $2.70 a share tops for the full year in earnings per share is what the company is expecting. Analysts are looking for $3.20.We know Kohl's, Jharonne, has had some issues, right? The company's CEO left. It's under activist pressure. What do you see it doing to sort of get consumers back?JHARONNE MARTIS: Well, in fact, it's interesting because this is a sector-- we've been talking about the death of the department stores for quite some time now. It's not just Kohl's. It's more of the fact that the department stores have fallen out of favor.However, when we look deep into that sector, there is one department store that stands out of all of them, and that's Dillard's. And the reason I'm bringing up Dillard's is because this is a retailer that has smashed earnings expectations and has done much better than the other ones because it's controlled its promotions. It's been less promotional during the holidays and as a result was able to do better when it comes to margins compared to the other department stores. And also it's been able to steal a lot of-- some of that market share between Macy's and Nordstrom's as it's trying to maintain some of its exclusivity with better brands and hasn't suffered as much as the other ones.So in order for Kohl's-- I think it's more of a department-store issue. Less promotions would definitely help a lot of the profits at these stores. But in general, they've been out of favor for some time-- in fact, even the mall stores.And as we're seeing, it's also a very bad macroeconomic situation right now where the consumers have shifted their spending. They're moving away from discretionary and sticking to staples. As a result, it's not the best scenario for the department stores in 2023.BRAD SMITH: And what about for stores that dabble in the business of buying in bulk? We've got a company in Costco that's going to be reporting earnings this week. Is there anything that you're seeing among consumers that would say that's exactly where they're going? They're going for the 24 pack of anything from the toilet paper all the way to the paper towels at a time to really offset or at least hedge against where they might be seeing inflationary pressures elsewhere on a per unit cost.JHARONNE MARTIS: Absolutely. I was at Costco this weekend, and let me tell you, those lines were incredible as the consumer continues to gravitate and stick to those where value is everything for the consumer right now. They're looking for any way to save a penny.And as a result, Costco not only does well because of the value but it really has that loyal consumer that continues to renew that membership. And because of the macroeconomic situation since the pandemic, it has consistently continued to gain more membership, and that is key, especially in this macroeconomic climate.We're also seeing that because the value proposition is so important that the families are telling their other family members, and as a result, they're luring in also new shoppers. So they're getting word of mouth. The value proposition is there, luring in consumers. And obviously they're in strong demand. And they're giving discounts also at the pump, which we're seeing that the retailers that are offering more discounts at the pump, like Sam's, are continuously outperforming the other discounters. So as a result, Costco is well poised to do well.JULIE HYMAN: We are looking forward to those numbers. Thanks so much for talking to us, Jharonne. Jharonne Martis is Refinitiv director of consumer research. Appreciate it.]"

ROST reported robust fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results, wherein the top and bottom lines beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate. The company’s results benefited from positive customer response to its improved merchandise and strong value offerings despite the competitive environment. Also, earnings improved year over year, while sales declined. Sales were hurt by the ongoing inflationary pressure on its low-to-moderate income group customers.Ross Stores’ earnings of $1.31 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.23 and our estimate of $1.19. Earnings also improved 26% from $1.04 reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.Total sales of $5,214.2 million dropped 3.9% year over year but surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,130 million and our estimate of $5,108.5 million. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2022, comps improved 1% compared with growth of 9% in the year-ago quarter. Comps benefited from higher average basket size due to flat traffic trends compared with the last year.In the holiday season, the shoes category remained the key growth driver, with Florida being the top-performing region. Sales trends continued to improve at the dd’s DISCOUNTS format, similar to the Ross chain of stores. However, dd’s DISCOUNTS’ sales continued to trail Ross’ due to ongoing inflationary pressures, which are having a huge impact on dd’s low-income customers.Shares of the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have gained 16.3% in the past year against the industry’s decline of 4%.Ross Stores, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Ross Stores, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseRoss Stores, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Ross Stores, Inc. QuoteQ4 InsightsThe cost of goods sold (COGS) of $3,926.2 million increased 4% year over year. As a percentage of sales, COGS was 75.3%, marking a year-over-year increase of 15 basis points (bps). The increase resulted from higher distribution expenses, offset by higher merchandise margin and lower buying expenses. Distribution costs rose 90 bps, owing to the unfavorable timing of pack-away-related expenses and deleverage from its new Houston distribution center. However, higher expenses were somewhat offset by a 5-bps occupancy deleverage and a 20-bps decline in domestic freight.Increased distribution expenses were offset by an 85-bps decline in buying costs due to lower incentive compensation. Also, the merchandise margin increased 15 bps in the quarter, owing to lower ocean freight, more than offset by higher markdowns.Selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses of $729.3 million declined 3.5% year over year. SG&amp;A, as a percentage of sales, contracted 105 bps year over year to 14%. The decrease resulted from lower incentive costs.The operating margin of 10.7% expanded 90 bps from 9.8% in fourth-quarter fiscal 2021. The increase can be attributed to the lower freight and incentive costs, partly negated by unfavorable timing of packaway-related costs.Story continuesStore UpdateAs of Jan 28, 2023, Ross Stores operated 2,015 outlets, including 1,693 Ross stores across 40 states, the District of Columbia and Guam, and 322 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores in 21 states.In first-quarter 2023, the company expects to open 19 stores, comprising 11 Ross and eight dd's DISCOUNTS stores. In fiscal 2023, it expects to open 100 stores, including 75 Ross and 25 dd’s DISCOUNTS. These openings do not include the plans to close 10 existing stores in fiscal 2023.FinancialsRoss Stores ended fiscal 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $4,551.9 million, long-term debt of $2,456.5 million, and total shareholders’ equity of $4,288.6 million.As of the end of fiscal 2022, consolidated inventories declined 10.6% from the fiscal 2021 comparable period, reflecting a significant moderation from the first half of fiscal 2022. Average store inventory was slightly down in the quarter than the 2021 holiday period. Pack-away merchandise represented 40% of the total inventories, in line with the prior year.The company bought back 2.1 million shares of common stock for $231 million in the fiscal fourth quarter. In fiscal 2022, it repurchased 10.3 million shares for an aggregate value of $950 million under its two-year $1.9-billion authorization approved in March 2022. ROST is on track to repurchase the remaining $950 million under the existing plan in fiscal 2023.Recently, Ross Stores increased its quarterly cash dividend 8% to 33.5 cents per share. The dividend is payable Mar 31, 2022, to shareholders of record as of Mar 14, 2022.For fiscal 2023, the company expects to spend capital expenditure of $810 million as it continues to make investments in stores, supply chain and merchant processes to support long-term growth and increase business efficiencies.OutlookThe company provided a conservative view for fiscal 2023, given the ongoing uncertainty in the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. For fiscal 2023, it expects comps to be relatively flat, whereas it posted a 4% decline in fiscal 2022. ROST envisions sales growth of 2-5% for the 53 weeks ending Feb 3, 2024.Based on the sales view, the company estimates the operating margin for fiscal 2023 to be 10.3-10.7%. The operating margin view incorporates the effects of the resetting of the baseline incentive compensation, higher wages, lower freight costs and the deleveraging effects of flat comps. The operating margin is also expected to benefit from the 53rd week to the tune of 20 bps.The company anticipates earnings per share of $4.65-$4.95 for the 53-weeks ended Feb 3, 2024, whereas it posted $4.38 in fiscal 2022. The extra 53rd week is expected to aid fiscal 2023 earnings per share by 15 cents.The company anticipates a net interest income of $115 million for fiscal 2023. Depreciation and amortization, including stock-based amortization, are expected to be $570 million. The fiscal 2023 tax rate is anticipated to be 24-25%, while shares outstanding are expected to be 339 million.For first-quarter fiscal 2023, the company expects comps to be relatively flat for the 52 weeks ending Jan 27, 2024, whereas it reported 7% comps growth in the prior-year quarter. The comp performance is likely to reflect the continued impacts of the elevated inflation on its low-to-moderate income customers. Sales are expected to increase 1-4% year over year in the fiscal first quarter.The company envisions the operating margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 to be 9.6-9.9%, whereas it reported 10.8% in the prior year. The decline is expected to result from the deleveraging effect of comps performance, unfavorable timing of packaway-related costs and elevated wages. However, the company expects merchandise margin to benefit from lower freight costs.Earnings per share are envisioned between 99 cents and $1.05 for the fiscal first quarter. The company reported earnings of 97 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.ROST anticipates a net interest income of $28 million for the fiscal first quarter. The tax rate is expected to be 24-25%, while shares outstanding are estimated to be 341 million.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are three other top-ranked stocks to consider — Tapestry TPR, Costco Wholesale COST and Arhaus ARHS.Tapestry, which offers lifestyle products in the United States and International markets, currently has a Zacks Rank #2.

They're both aligning on the same theme of more caution ahead.Let's dive into the retail earnings and the state of the consumer with Jharonne Martis, Refinitiv's director of consumer research. Jharonne, good to see you. Speaking of retail, what a cool dress you have on.Let's talk about the caution that we're hearing, right, because it's not just Lowe's and Kohl's this morning. We got it from Home Depot. We got it from Walmart. We got it from Target. Given that the numbers right now look pretty good for some of these companies, why so much caution? What's going to go wrong as the year goes on?JHARONNE MARTIS: As you mentioned, Julie-- good morning. Yes, it's not just Lowe's. It's also Ross. It's Target. It's a number of companies who are warning us not to expect too much from them, and this is mainly because the theme this earnings season is inflation. About 146 retailers have already reported, and over 90% have mentioned inflation during their earnings call, and they're warning us not to expect too much from them. They've been very conservative on their guidance for the first quarter.In fact, for every positive guidance we've received, we've received seven negative guidance preannouncements, and this is the highest negative to positive-- the weakest negative-to-positive ratio that we've seen in over a year now, mainly because of the uncertainty of the macroeconomic factors and where inflation might be headed for the rest of the year. As a result, earnings expectations have been lowered for the full year for 2023 and also for the first quarter.Story continuesBRAD SMITH: For some of these companies, and especially for Target and Walmart, Jharonne-- and great to see you-- it's really about the discretionary categories that they've taken a hit in. Where do you see either further pricing mechanisms that they're going to have to roll out and that perhaps continuing to impact some of their margins just in order to clear out old inventory in the apparel, electronics, the home categories as well?JHARONNE MARTIS: So there's different dynamics to your question, Brad. Good morning. So first off, because of the inflation, the value proposition is key to the consumer. The consumer will only open up their wallets if they feel that they're getting a good price or a good discount. So in a collaboration with Centraprise and Refinitiv discovered that the average promotion rose in the month of January, which is what helped bring in a lot of that traffic that we're telling-- that we're seeing that retailers are telling us that they saw in the month of January.But already companies like Urban Outfitters are giving us a glimpse of February, and we're seeing that the traffic already decreased. So number one, yes, there's going to be a lot of promotions in order to move that inventory, which we're already seeing is hurting gross profit margins.Then there's the value proposition. Consumers are trading down, and as a result, we're seeing that the dollar stores are benefiting the most. Groceries, Target, and Walmart are the main sectors that are helping offset a lot of the weakness of discretionary spending.But then also we're seeing that the dollar stores knocked it out of the park today, and this is because the low-end consumer is gainfully employed. There's high demand for their employment. They feel good about their job security. And as a result, the dollar stores are expanding their stores in a time when a lot of the other retailers are struggling. As a result, the dollar stores posted some of the strongest same-store sales we've seen, even before prepandemic levels.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, which makes sense given what we're seeing from the consumer, although we are seeing those Dollar Tree shares slip a little bit. One company that sort of stands out here as not showing strength despite being, one could argue, on the value end of the spectrum is Kohl's, right? The company's same-store sales fell 6.6%. That's more than estimated. The forecast for the full year, I mean, even given that we've had a lot of negative forecasts, this one is pretty bad. $2.70 a share tops for the full year in earnings per share is what the company is expecting. Analysts are looking for $3.20.We know Kohl's, Jharonne, has had some issues, right? The company's CEO left. It's under activist pressure. What do you see it doing to sort of get consumers back?JHARONNE MARTIS: Well, in fact, it's interesting because this is a sector-- we've been talking about the death of the department stores for quite some time now. It's not just Kohl's. It's more of the fact that the department stores have fallen out of favor.However, when we look deep into that sector, there is one department store that stands out of all of them, and that's Dillard's. And the reason I'm bringing up Dillard's is because this is a retailer that has smashed earnings expectations and has done much better than the other ones because it's controlled its promotions. It's been less promotional during the holidays and as a result was able to do better when it comes to margins compared to the other department stores. And also it's been able to steal a lot of-- some of that market share between Macy's and Nordstrom's as it's trying to maintain some of its exclusivity with better brands and hasn't suffered as much as the other ones.So in order for Kohl's-- I think it's more of a department-store issue. Less promotions would definitely help a lot of the profits at these stores. But in general, they've been out of favor for some time-- in fact, even the mall stores.And as we're seeing, it's also a very bad macroeconomic situation right now where the consumers have shifted their spending. They're moving away from discretionary and sticking to staples. As a result, it's not the best scenario for the department stores in 2023.BRAD SMITH: And what about for stores that dabble in the business of buying in bulk? We've got a company in Costco that's going to be reporting earnings this week. Is there anything that you're seeing among consumers that would say that's exactly where they're going? They're going for the 24 pack of anything from the toilet paper all the way to the paper towels at a time to really offset or at least hedge against where they might be seeing inflationary pressures elsewhere on a per unit cost.JHARONNE MARTIS: Absolutely. I was at Costco this weekend, and let me tell you, those lines were incredible as the consumer continues to gravitate and stick to those where value is everything for the consumer right now. They're looking for any way to save a penny.And as a result, Costco not only does well because of the value but it really has that loyal consumer that continues to renew that membership. And because of the macroeconomic situation since the pandemic, it has consistently continued to gain more membership, and that is key, especially in this macroeconomic climate.We're also seeing that because the value proposition is so important that the families are telling their other family members, and as a result, they're luring in also new shoppers. So they're getting word of mouth. The value proposition is there, luring in consumers. And obviously they're in strong demand. And they're giving discounts also at the pump, which we're seeing that the retailers that are offering more discounts at the pump, like Sam's, are continuously outperforming the other discounters. So as a result, Costco is well poised to do well.JULIE HYMAN: We are looking forward to those numbers. Thanks so much for talking to us, Jharonne. Jharonne Martis is Refinitiv director of consumer research. Appreciate it.]"

(Operator Instructions) Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results, including sales and earnings forecasts, new store openings and other matters that are based on the company's current forecast of aspects of its future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. Risk factors are included in today's press release and the company's fiscal 2021 Form 10-K and fiscal 2022 Form 10-Qs and 8-Ks on file with the SEC.And now I'd like to turn the call over to Barbara Rentler. Chief Executive Officer.Story continuesBarbara RentlerJoining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President and Chief Operating Officer; Adam Orvos, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Group Vice President, Investor Relations. We'll begin our call today with a review of our fourth quarter and 2022 performance, followed by our outlook for 2023. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.As noted in today's press release, during a very competitive holiday season, our fourth quarter sales and earnings results exceeded our guidance due to customers' positive response to our improved assortment and stronger value offerings. Earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1.31 on net income of $447 million. These results compare to earnings per share of $1.04 on net earnings of $367 million for the 13 weeks ended January 29, 2022. Sales for the fourth quarter of 2022 were $5.2 billion with comparable store sales up 1% on top of a 9% increase for the same period in 2021. For the 2022 fiscal year, earnings per share were $4.38 on net income of $1.5 billion compared to $4.87 per share on net earnings of $1.7 billion in 2021. Sales for 2022 were $18.7 billion, with comparable store sales down 4% versus a robust 13% increase in the prior year. Fourth quarter operating margin was 10.7% compared to 9.8% in 2021. This improvement was mainly driven by lower freight and incentive costs that were partially offset by unfavorable timing of packaway-related expenses.Now let's turn to additional details on our fourth quarter results. For the holiday selling season, shoes was the best-performing merchandise area, while Florida was the strongest region. Similar to Ross, dd's DISCOUNTS sales trends improved compared to the prior quarter but continue to trail Ross' results primarily due to ongoing inflationary pressures that are continuing to have a larger impact on dd's lower-income customers. Inventory levels moderated significantly from the first half of 2022 with consolidated inventories down 11% versus last year. Average store inventories during the quarter were down slightly compared to 2021 holiday period, while packaway merchandise represented 40% of total inventories similar to last year. We also believe we are well positioned to take advantage of the numerous buying opportunities in the marketplace.As noted in today's release, the company repurchased a total of 2.1 million and 10.3 million shares of common stock, respectively, for an aggregate purchase price of $231 million in the quarter and $950 million for the fiscal year. These purchases were made pursuant to the 2-year $1.9 billion program announced in March of 2022. We expect to complete the $950 million remaining under this authorization in fiscal 2023. Our Board also recently increased our quarterly cash dividend by 8% and to $0.335 per share to be payable on March 31, 2023, to stockholders of record as of March 14, 2023. Our stock repurchase and increased dividend program reflects our continued commitment to enhancing stockholder value and returns as well as our confidence in the strength of our balance sheet and projected future cash flows.Now Adam will provide further details on our fourth quarter results and additional color on our outlook for fiscal 2023.Adam M. OrvosThank you, Barbara. As previously mentioned, comparable store sales rose 1% for the quarter on top of a 9% gain in the prior year. This slight increase was due to growth in the size of the average basket as traffic was relatively flat compared to last year. As Barbara discussed earlier, fourth quarter operating margin of 10.7% was up 90 basis points from 9.8% in 2021. Cost of goods sold grew 15 basis points versus last year due to a combination of factors. Distribution expenses rose 90 basis points primarily due to timing of packaway-related costs and deleverage from the opening of our Houston distribution center earlier in the year, while domestic freight and occupancy delevered by 20 and 5 basis points, respectively. Partially offsetting these costs with higher merchandise margin, which grew by 15 basis points as the benefit from lower ocean freight costs more than offset somewhat higher markdowns. Buying expenses also improved by 85 basis points due to lower incentive compensation. SG&amp;A for the period levered by 105 basis points, again, primarily due to lower incentive expense.Now let's discuss our outlook for fiscal 2023. As Barbara noted in our press release, the macroeconomic and geopolitical environments remain highly uncertain. As a result, we believe it is prudent to remain conservative when planning our business. While we hope to do better for the 52 weeks ending January 27, 2024, we are planning comparable store sales to be relatively flat. If sales perform in line with this plan, we expect earnings per share for 2023 to be in the range of $4.65 to $4.95 compared to $4.38 in fiscal 2022. It is important to note that fiscal 2023 is a 53-week year. Incorporated in this guidance range is an estimated benefit to earnings per share of approximately $0.15 from the extra week.Our guidance assumptions for the 2023 year include the following: Total sales are planned to grow by 2% to 5% for the 53 weeks ending February 3, 2024. Comparable store sales for the 52 weeks ending January 27, 2024, are planned to be relatively flat. Based on these sales plans, Operating margin for the full year is expected to be in the range of 10.3% to 10.7%. This reflects the resetting of the baseline for incentive compensation, higher wages, the deleveraging effect on flattish same-store sales and lower freight costs. Also incorporated in this operating margin guidance is an estimated benefit of about 20 basis points from the 53rd week.For 2023, we expect to open approximately 100 new locations comprised of about 75 Ross and 25 dd's DISCOUNTS. As usual, these openings do not include our plans to close or relocate about 10 older stores. Net interest income is estimated to be $115 million. Depreciation and amortization expense inclusive of stock-based amortization is forecast to be about $570 million for the year. The tax rate is projected to be about 24% to 25% and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately $339 million. In addition, capital expenditures for 2023 are planned to be approximately $810 million as we make further investments in our stores, supply chain and merchant processes to support our long-term growth and to increase efficiencies throughout the business.Let's turn now to our guidance for the first quarter. Elevated inflation continues to impact our low to moderate income customer. As such, we are also planning comparable store sales to be relatively flat for the 13 weeks ending April 29, 2023. This compares to a 7% decrease and a 13% gain in the first quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively. If sales perform in line with this plan, we expect earnings per share for the first quarter of 2023 to be $0.99 to $1.05 versus $0.97 last year. The operating statement assumptions that support our first quarter guidance include the following: Total sales are planned to be up 1% to 4% versus last year's first quarter. We would then expect first quarter operating margin to be 9.6% to 9.9% compared to 10.8% last year. The expected decline reflects the deleveraging effect of same-store sales perform in line with our plan, unfavorable timing of packaway-related costs and higher wages. Further, merchandise margin is forecast to benefit from lower freight costs. We plan to add 19 new stores consisting of 11 Ross and 8 dd's DISCOUNTS during the period. Net interest income is estimated to be $28 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 24% to 25% and diluted shares are forecast to be about $341 million.Now I will turn the call back to Barbara Rentler for closing comments.Barbara RentlerThank you, Adam. To sum up, over the past 3 years, we have faced a wide range of unprecedented challenges from the COVID pandemic, supply chain disruptions as well as ongoing inflationary headwinds. These factors have not only negatively impacted our own business, but also our customers' household budgets, their discretionary income and their shopping behaviors. As a result, our shoppers today are seeking even stronger values when visiting our stores. In response, our merchants are fine-tuning our assortments with an increased focus on delivering the most competitive bargains available while continuing to adjust our product mix based on our customers' evolving preferences. Looking ahead, we have significantly increased our focus on strictly controlling inventory and operating expenses throughout the company. We strongly believe that these measures will enable us to maximize our potential for both sales and profit growth in 2023 and beyond.At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.Lorraine Corrine Maikis HutchinsonI wanted to ask about freight, both of the components within gross margin. How much recovery do you have baked into your guidance for this year versus pre-COVID levels? And then how much opportunity remains for the next year and the year after?Adam M. OrvosYes. So Lorraine, this is Adam. Thanks for the question. related to merchandise margin, Q1 and fiscal 2023 will clearly benefit from lower ocean freight costs as we anniversary the significantly higher cost from last year. While these costs will drop, they'll likely still be higher than pre-pandemic levels in the short term. But on the ocean side, they've clearly dropped dramatically and we'll harvest a significant portion of the increase we've faced over the last 3 years. On the domestic side, because of wages -- elevated wages and still higher fuel cost than pre-pandemic, we'll harvest back some of the domestic freight, but not as tangible in 2023 as it will be on the ocean side.Lorraine Corrine Maikis HutchinsonSo you'd say some opportunity will remain for fiscal '24?Adam M. OrvosProbably not prudent to go that far ahead, but it clearly will be a tailwind on both sides for us in 2023. And depending on how much they move in 2023. That I'll kind of see what's left for 2024.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.Matthew Robert BossCongrats on a nice quarter. So Barbara, on fourth quarter same-store sales inflecting back to positive territory, maybe can you just speak to the cadence of traffic that you saw during the quarter? And then on the outlook for flat comps in both 1Q and for the year relative to historically a 1% to 2% starting plan. Have you seen a material change in customer behavior post-holiday? Or is this more just taking a prudent stance given the volatility that you cited?Michael J. HartshornMatthew, it's Michael Hartshorn. On the guidance for the first quarter, as we said in our commentary, with the lasting inflation and highly uncertain macro economy ahead of us, we firmly believe it's prudent to be conservative in planning the business. Internally, this puts us in a chase mode to start the year, both from an inventory open-to-buy perspective and in managing the underlying cost in the business. It's a playbook that we're familiar with. We know well and believe it will allow us to, as we said in the commentary, maximize both the top line and the bottom line in an uncertain environment, and we'll have to see how it plays out for the year. In terms of traffic data, as we said in the commentary, traffic was relatively flat in the quarter, and that was relatively consistent across the fourth quarter.Matthew Robert BossGreat. And then maybe just a follow-up on gross margin. So if we exclude the freight recovery, how are you thinking about underlying merchandise margins within this year's guide? Meaning, is there any impact we need to think about with some of the changes in mix that you cited? Maybe how best to think about price. I mean, what I'm really trying to get at is beyond this year, do you think there's any structural underlying change to double-digit earnings growth in this model if we can get back to that 3% to 4% comp algorithm?Michael J. HartshornLet me talk a little bit about the long-term operating model. We certainly, with ocean freights coming down, we'd expect to see a big benefit this year. Longer term, the margin improvements will be highly dependent on sustained strong sales growth, but also, as we mentioned, to a large extent, the persistence and the inflationary costs in the business. We, again, expect to see ocean freight costs preceding this year, but they still remain above pre-pandemic levels and a number of transportation lanes. So that could be a benefit beyond 2023.We also expect to see lower domestic freight rates this year, and that's embedded in our guidance. But we see these pressures easing over a longer horizon and is somewhat dependent on fuel costs. Wage costs have risen, but are growing at a slower pace than they did during the pandemic. We expect from a wage perspective that it will be an ongoing pressure, but we are finding ways to be more efficient in the business that's offsetting some of those costs. So all of those taken together, we believe we can grow our EBIT margins and profitability over time, but it will be very important to drive top line sales growth in that equation.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager with Baird.Mark R. AltschwagerIn terms of the competitive backdrop, some of the bigger general merchandise retailers look leaner on inventory, especially apparel and discretionary categories heading into the spring. Just curious how that's incorporating into your thinking on comps and potential for some recapture of market share cycling last year?Barbara RentlerSure. I think -- then pulling back on general merchandise potentially gives sense gives us an opportunity to grow those businesses since it's such a big part of our business. But I really think regaining, capturing market share, however we want to say that, it really depends on driving sales, and we think that the best way to drive sales is for us to continue to focus on value for our customer. I mean that's really what helped us perform in the fourth quarter is really making sure that we're delivering the best brand of organ possible throughout the entire store. And that really is our focus. That compounded with the fact that there's a lot of merchandise in the marketplace, which will enable us to do that. I think that's really what will help us gain back that market share, whether it's coming from a big box or it's coming from other parts of retail departmental stores whatever it is. I think that's really the key for our success go forward to drive top line sales.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citigroup.Paul Lawrence LejuezAre you seeing any signs of a trade-down customers showing up in your stores? I know you said transactions traffic was flat, but curious if the customer base is changing at all or maybe you're seeing some higher income folks show up, maybe some of the lower income folks shop less. I'm also curious how you're thinking about the drivers of comp in F '23 from a traffic versus ticket perspective.Michael J. HartshornPaul, on the trade-down customer, there isn't what we see in our data, a material shift in spending trends across the different income demographics. So at this point for us, we don't see any evidence that the trade down -- that there is the trade down customers impacting our business. On how we're thinking about the business going forward. We don't typically plan the business based on the components of the transaction. As Barbara said, our focus is on value and off-price value will lead to a better traffic, it will lead to a higher basket if you offer great deals to the customer, and that's how we're thinking about the business going forward.Paul Lawrence LejuezGot it. And can you just share what your home versus apparel comps were in 4Q? Also curious about California, Florida, Texas performance.Barbara RentlerSure. The home sales were slightly above the chain average. And then overall, apparel, non-apparel performance was relatively similar. And the thing that part of what's really drove home is that Home has the highest penetration of gifting and that part of our business performed well.Adam M. OrvosAnd Paul, on the geography side, Florida, as we mentioned, it was the strongest market. Regarding our other large markets, California performed slightly above the chain average and Texas tracked in line with the change average. With all that said, we did not see a lot of deviation in the numbers by geographic area.OperatorThe next question is from the line of Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse.Michael Charles BinettiCould you unpack how you're thinking about the merch margin, excluding the freight here for the year, I guess, the product margin. Just trying to think -- just trying to marry up what you guys are seeing on inventory buys and how pricing can lead us to the product margin this year? And then I guess, pretty simple one, Michael, when you guys think about the puts and takes on -- or Michael or Adam, I should say, puts and takes on the margins and the buckets that you pointed to resetting the incentive comp, the higher wages, the flat same-store sales impact and the lower freight cost. Can you speak to how the upside would flow through on 1 point of comp this year? I know you always give us some -- the framework of about 15 basis points, I think, for memory, what's better in the composition of the model this year? What's worse than normal on a 1 point of upside in the comp?Michael J. HartshornMichael, you got it exactly right. 1 point of comp is approximately 10 to 15 basis points of EBIT margin expansion. So that hasn't changed.Adam M. OrvosAnd Michael, I'll jump in. So like on operating margin, the moving parts in 2023. So first of all, we're planning the flat comp, which will cause some amount of deleverage. As you mentioned, we have to reset our incentive cost at target levels. So 2022 was clearly an underperforming year for us, and that was on top of a 2021 where we significantly overperformed our plan. So for 2023, we will reset that baseline at target levels. Michael mentioned earlier, we've seen wage increases, both in our stores and our distribution centers. And while that's easing we've not been able to fully mitigate those increases within the stores by driving other efficiencies. And then my earlier comments on freight, we expect good news on both sides but more dramatic improvement on the ocean side.Barbara RentlerAnd then in terms of buying, Michael, I know you know there's a lot of merchandise out in the marketplace. But the way we're way we're looking at that now is we are really highly focused on value and giving our customers the best value possible. And -- so that very much depends on our mix on the buys, what we're doing and really driving broad-based across the company. I can't emphasize this enough, the best value possible that we can because that really -- our customer is under such inflationary pressures that it definitely is impacting on her spend and so her discretionary spend. And so that's really how we're thinking about that, making sure that our values are correct and that we have a good, better, best strategy and that she really feels great about what she buys and that it's compelling to come to the store. And so those AUR since it would take us down the path of AUR is not a direct opening price point strategy. It really is good, better, best strategy based on brands that we have out there so that she can really get the value that she's come to expect from us.Michael Charles BinettiBarb, could I chase that with a question on how you think about what are the biggest opportunities that you see to go after some market share this year to help -- if there is an opportunity to drive comp above flat, maybe it's from the ability to compete better, anything that stands out to you early in the year?Barbara RentlerI think -- well, I think there's a few things. Just internally, we had our own internal issues, obviously, last year within our assortments. So correcting those issues right now is important to us just from a balance and mix perspective. Based off of the carrier issues and the things that went wrong last year, I think that's probably first and foremost, getting that corrected and then really rightsizing again, our values that we're offering the customer and understanding what our pricing strategy really is and hitting all 3 customers.Then outside of that is if we execute better, history would tell us and we chase, which is what we do best, in a time where there's a lot of merchandise in the market, which there is, we should be able to drive sales and take market share. And that market share, as you know, can come from any bucket of merchandising now since everyone is -- whether it's big boxes or everyone is in the game now. So I think that's kind of the formula for us to correct our issues from last year to get our value straight and so that the customer really is getting a great deal maximizing those closeouts in the market. And listen, remember, we have a very large merchant team. We have 900 merchants. And so -- and strong relationships in the market. So now is the time for us to maximize on that and to really give the customer what she's come to expect from us and to get ourselves set. And if we do those things, then I think we'll get ourselves on the track we want to be on and continue to grow and gain market share.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Alex Straton with Morgan Stanley.Alexandra Ann StratonIt sounds like sales recovery is key to returning to pre-COVID margin and the earnings algorithm, but are you exploring ways to kind of offset that while top line growth is underperforming that typical algorithm? Maybe put differently, what specific levers do you have in COGS or SG&amp;A to offset some of the freight and wage headwinds you're seeing this year? I know you mentioned some efficiencies, but any examples there -- levers broadly would be helpful to hear.Michael J. HartshornSure. You'll see in our capital spend this year, we have about $810 million included in that and one of the biggest increases there are technology investments that we're making. And some examples of that would be automation in our distribution centers. It would be looking at store level activities and providing technology to make those more efficient in all of our stores, for instance, how our associates mark down goods, how they receive in the back room and making sure we can continue to have associates focusing on customer facing and activities. So those are a few of those examples. And we have -- as we have over the years, have a road map of efficiencies that will continue to work on as an organization and drive into the P&amp;L.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.Jesse SobelsonThis is Jesse Sobelson on for Ike. I believe at the beginning of last year's first quarter, the buying environment was just beginning to turn into a tailwind for you guys. So how does the environment look today versus this time last year and then versus maybe 6 months ago?Barbara RentlerSure. The buying environment right now is very good. I mean there's a lot of merchandise. It's very broad-based. It's across all different classifications and types of products. So the buying environment is probably as good as it gets right now. I would say that, that environment has been there, though for the last few months and started at the beginning of last year, just timed perhaps differently depending upon what type of product it was and when it came in, all going back to the carrier issue, right? So everyone was kind of -- vendors were kind of late in receiving their goods because people couldn't really control the way the freight came in. So it's been here for a while. I would think at this point in time, a lot of stores have promoting to get their inventories in line in-store, but the vendor community still has a lot of merchandise that they'd like to move through and take them forward to newness to the next year. So I think it's I think it's very good now. I think it's been good, and I think it will be good for a while as the vendors are trying to work through that and understand what that looks like and then understand what kind of inventory position they want to take go forward as opposed to having a result and that coming from the carrier issues that everybody kind of felt at the same time. So...OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih with Barclays.Adrienne Eugenia Yih-TennantGreat. First, just a housekeeping. Is it fair to use $200 million to $250 million in sales for that 53rd week? And then Barbara, I think, maybe this for you. What is the issue with sort of the packaway timing. And I know packaway ended up at 40% but that's still below kind of run rate norm. And I'm just thinking if the environment is super conducive, would you not want to kind of have that short stay because I know you guys do it more on a 4-month or less or whatever shorter duration. And then last one is for the shrink. I think you do it once a year, but what shrink as a percent of sales in a normal backdrop, where is it today? Sorry to interrupt.Barbara RentlerOkay. No problem. So the packaway is 40%, overall deals that we feel very, very good about. And you have to remember that in the beginning of last year, and you'll see this as we go along, we had all those late goods that were home goods that we took into our DCs, which would have increased part of our packaway. The 40% that we have in there right now, we feel very good about. And buying packaway is an art, you can buy a lot of packaway time you want, right? But the packaway you put in there, you have to feel it's great product at great values. And right now, with the buying environment being very favorable with really, quite frankly, broad access to some really key brands, you're going to be very judicious about what you put in packaway and how you time that and what that looks like. So I'd say we feel good about the position we're in today. We have a tremendous amount of liquidity and we really feel like we're in a good place.Michael J. HartshornAdrienne, on shrink. So our strength, we don't disclose what it is externally, but it is a place where we constantly invest, whether it's security tags or no equipment in the stores. If you've been in our stores, you see we have people in front of the store and our shrink was slightly higher this year as we closed out the year.Adam M. OrvosAnd Adrienne...Barbara RentlerYes, go ahead.Adam M. OrvosWell, I was just going to jump in on the 53rd week. So a little bit higher than what you said. You can think about it as an additional week, somewhat pro rata, but then downward calibrated a little bit that it's, call it, in January, February week and lighter than an average week.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett.Charles P. GromCurious if stores in higher demographic markets performed better and store in lower income demographic markets. And a second follow-up, there's a lot of talk about SNAP cuts next month and lower tax refunds this year versus last. Curious how much of a potential headwind that could be for you guys over the next couple of months.Michael J. HartshornYes, we'll have to see. On the tax refunds, they just started to come out last week, and that does have an impact, especially for our dd's business, but we'll have to see how that plays out. We certainly where we're coming into it, the tax refunds could be lower. So we'll have to see how it plays out. But certainly, that is a customer that can be impacted by both the tax refunds and the SNAP benefits. On your other question, I think you asked a question around demographics. And I think I answered this earlier with Paul, we have not seen a material shift in spending across different income demographics.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs.Brooke Siler RoachBarbara, it sounds like you continue to see opportunities to rightsize the value that you offer the consumer to go after that market share that's available to you and that you're still looking to optimize that value. Can you talk a little bit more about the actions that your buying team can take to ensure that you're offering that value? And can you contextualize that with the higher rate of markdowns that you also saw in the quarter?Barbara RentlerSure. Well, obviously, when there's a lot of merchandise in the marketplace, the buyers are out looking for really great deals. So it starts with being in the market, having good relationships and really getting the deals at the prices that the customer wants and then offering that value to the customer. So I think that's critical for what's going on in the world today. It's always been critical for us delivering branded bargains. And I think today it's even more important than it's been before. In terms of just -- rightsizing the value just as a concept of rightsizing the value. I think that's really from putting things out there and watching things turn, watching things -- watching the customer vote and then making the adjustments based off of what she's telling us, whether it's in the assortment and the products that she want or whether it's in the retail that we put it in. And Brooke, what was the second question?Brooke Siler RoachThe second question was just how to think about the time line of getting that from a markdown perspective. It sounds like making those adjustments does require some markdown. And so does the markdown have to increase year-on-year as you move through 2023?Barbara RentlerWe took -- okay, I understood. So we took somewhat slightly higher markdowns in the fourth quarter. And we made sure that when we came out of the fourth quarter that we really came out of everything clean that we took everything. And if the value wasn't right, we didn't wait, we took markdowns, they were somewhat higher, they weren't that much higher, they were somewhat higher. And so if you're rightsizing your values going forward, you wouldn't expect to be taking additional markdowns. The key is to drive receipts, which drives sales. So if we have the right values and return quick enough, we'll drive receipts, which will drive sales, which will put us in a healthy position.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey with the Telsey Group.Dana Lauren TelseyAs you think about the real estate portfolio in the stores, we obviously have heard about some of the space availabilities from the Bed Bath or a Party City. Is this an opportunity for you? And does it all change the cadence of store openings or the locations or regions for either 2023 or 2024 in your outlook?Michael J. HartshornDana, certainly, Bed Bath, Beyond and Party City, like they have been historically, any time there's retail bankruptcies that's provided us opportunities for new store locations. I would say at this point, it hasn't changed our outlook. We will review potential new site on a store-by-store basis. And if it's appropriate for Ross and dd's location, we can certainly add it to our portfolio. But as we think about 2023, as we said in the commentary, we think it's about 100 new locations, about 75 Ross and 25 dd's.Dana Lauren TelseyGot it. And then, Barbara, just on the category mix, what was the weakest? And what do you see as opportunities on the category side as we go through 2023?Barbara RentlerThe business pretty much performed at the same level. I mean, obviously, some things are better. I mean home and gifting was very good, shoes was very good. If I look at shoes from a 2-year basis, the year before we had carrier issues, which also helped us to drive some sales this year. I think the key is to get the category mix balance to what the customer wants. And I think last year with the carrier issues and with some of the things that went on in our assortments, that we didn't have that. So I think now it's really identifying what she wants, making those move to ensure that we are delivering the products that she's moving towards as things continue to evolve in her assortment and just being on target with that, making sure we're making moves quick enough, fast enough and the advantage when there's a lot of goods in the marketplace, it allows you to do more of these things and oftentimes, sometimes be able to make some bolder moves.So I think that's kind of how I'm thinking about it. I'm thinking about just getting our inventories and classifications in line and then more fine-tuning to what -- if we were talking about this a few months ago, we would be saying people now want career pants versus casual, right? But I'm thinking more broader that with all the carriers that went on and delivery issues and everything else, that things were not exactly the way we would like them to have been even if we wanted them to be there. It just -- it wasn't balanced. So I think that's our number 1 thing is getting ourselves back in line. We made a lot of those moves into the fourth quarter and getting ourselves repositioned to where we want to be. And then going again hand-in-hand with making sure we come in clean -- into the year clean from an inventory position and then giving ourselves the flexibility to go in the market and buy it the way the customer wants it and sees it.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel with BMO Capital Markets.Simeon Avram SiegelCould you discuss what like-for-like AUR look like versus mix shift driven AUR maybe? And then a dumb question. I think interest income came in nicely higher this quarter. And if I heard correctly, I think you're expecting a pretty nice jump or a nice number this year as well. Is that just a function of higher rates? And does it impact your capital return strategy? And maybe just given how large the cash balance is, any broader thoughts on your use of cash with all the moving pieces?Michael J. HartshornSure. The interest income is entirely driven by our cash balances. That's invested in government-backed securities. So as interest rates have risen, we're getting a benefit there. In terms of how we're thinking about use of cash, and I guess just general capital allocation, we will, as we always do, first invest in the business to support profitable growth. We also plan to pay down COVID-related debt that begins to mature over the next few years in '24 and '25 as when those first tranches mature. And then we'd expect to grow our shareholder payouts as the business grows, as I said, deliberately over time, and we do that in a very deliberate and reliable manner over time.Barbara RentlerAnd then in terms of our AUR, our AUR has been relatively flat despite all the different shifts and moving parts in the business. So some of that comes from valuing some areas differently or products differently in other businesses coming up because obviously, shoes has a higher AUR than some of our other businesses. So that's really where we stand today, how we're thinking about it.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Jay Sole with UBS.Jay Daniel SoleGreat. I'm wondering if you can elaborate a little bit on some of the higher wages that you mentioned as a driver of the EBIT margin in the first quarter this year. Can you just talk about the impact on what you're seeing at the store level versus like, say, a warehousing level versus at a corporate level, that would be helpful.Michael J. HartshornSure. I mean it's been a competitive market across all 3 of those for some time. What we saw during COVID is the biggest pressure we had was in the distribution center, line item and that we've seen the pressure there slow down considerably. And for the stores, we continue to take a market-by-market approach to staffing them and increasing wages where appropriate. In addition, as you know, there's growing statutory minimum wages for us in almost half of our store base, and that includes both statewide and local municipality minimum wages. But overall, it's really driven at this point by those minimum wages -- wage increases. I would say we feel good about the workforce in totality and are confident about what we have in place for the year.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Laura Champine with Loop Capital.Laura Allyson ChampineCrossing my fingers, you'll answer this one, but are you currently trending in line with your first quarter guide?Michael J. HartshornWe wouldn't. Our practice is, Laura, to not comment on inter-quarter trends.Laura Allyson ChampineUnderstood. Is the guidance for the full year comp to be flat would that assume that traffic is roughly flat this year?Michael J. HartshornWe -- again, we don't plan the business around traffic or transaction. Our view has always been if we provide the great branded bargains to the customer, that will be a combination of, one, bringing more customers to the store and two, when they're in the store, increasing the size of the average basket. What's happened over the last several years is that basket has grown and even into last year, on top of the stimulus year the customer is buying more when they're coming to the store.Laura Allyson ChampineLet me see if I can get this one. The gross margin, and this is last -- the gross margin commentary that you've made, is that consistent with taking more markdowns this year for the year as a whole compared to last year?Adam M. OrvosLaura, we don't guide really at that component level of merchandise margin, but obviously, our markdown levels will be highly dependent on if we deliver our sales plan and by the right goods. The biggest moving part as we said, in merchandise margin will be the ocean freight cost reductions that we're seeing in the marketplace.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Aneesha Sherman with Bernstein.Aneesha ShermanSo the comp guidance for the full year implies a 4-year stack of 10 a CAGR of just over 2%, which is quite a bit lower than your historical pre-COVID performance. Are you still -- do you still believe in the medium term, algo being kind of a little bit higher than that around the 3% comp algo? Or is there something structural about the comps that you think will decelerate even beyond this year? And then, Michael, you talked about the sensitivity of margins to comp, but with higher wages now embedded into your cost structure, has that sensitivity changed? Or is it still a similar sensitivity as what you've talked about in the past?Michael J. HartshornAneesha, on the guidance, it's hard to comment on structural in this environment. As we guide the year, it's really a function of us wanting to be very conservative in a blasting inflationary environment and a macro economy that we'll see how that plays out later in the year. So I don't think there's anything to read into that at this point. Obviously, we hope to beat the guidance. We think it's a good way to run our business in an uncertain environment. In terms of the long-term algorithm, it certainly doesn't change as I said earlier, that a beat to comp is 10 to 15 basis points upside. And then longer term, we think if we can grow the 3% to 4% comp as we did historically prior to COVID that we'll be able to leverage the P&amp;L.OperatorAnd our final question comes from the line of Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies.Corey TarloweYou mentioned that shoes had done pretty well a few times. Is there any way to parse out maybe whether it was in formal or casual, what did better? And then I know availability is quite robust, but across your good, better, best strategy, is there any particular segment within those 3 that's maybe you're seeing a little bit better availability. And then just lastly, on CapEx. Historically, you're usually around, I think, like $500 million or so in CapEx. And now I think in this year, you're expecting to do $800 million and in this coming year as well, another $800 million. So could you just parse out maybe what the incremental spend is really going to be? I know you talked a little bit about automation, but just curious what else there is in there.Barbara RentlerSo let me start with shoes. So the shoe business is pretty broad based. I would say that athletic performed slightly better than brand shoes, but the shoe business, again, the shoes industry had issues delivering, we remember that in 2021 with the whole carrier issue. So it is pretty broad-based and meeting customers' demands that they want not just athletic, but other brands shoes to wear. That's the first thing. In terms of a good, better, best, the availability is pretty broad-based in all 3 buckets. So I think that's a little unusual, but that is what -- that's kind of going on out there right at this moment.Adam M. OrvosAnd Corey, on CapEx. So our $810 million will roughly be 40% new in existing stores, 40% distribution centers and about 20% technology and other investments. And I would say with our new store opening plan of 100 new stores, that's -- those levels are consistent with pre-pandemic levels from a mix standpoint, the distribution line, probably a little bit inflated as we ramp up capacity to support our long-term growth and then the technology side is a ramp-up as we're making investments not only from a customer convenience standpoint in the stores, but also building capabilities and additional tools in the merchandising organization.OperatorAnd at this time, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And now I would like to turn the call back over to Barbara Rentler for closing remarks.Barbara RentlerThanks joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores.OperatorThat concludes our conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a great day.]"

In the same way, growth investors often end up investing in expensive stocks. Going by Warren Buffett, these two approaches are joined at the hip.Accordingly, some investors sought to join the bridge between value and growth with a hybrid strategy of investment. Their theory suggests that to make a long-term investment more effective, the principles of both value and growth strategies need to be combined.GARP (growth at a reasonable price) investment, often known as a special case of value investment, is gaining popularity. What GARPers look for is whether the stocks are somewhat undervalued and have solid sustainable growth potential (Investopedia).Several stocks, which have surged significantly in the recent past, show an overwhelming success of this hybrid investing strategy over pure-play value and growth investments. Here we will discuss the success of five such stocks. These include Meta Platforms, Henry Schein, Analog Devices, HSBC and Arch Capital Group.A Few More Words on GARPOne of the fundamental metrics for finding GARP is the price/earnings growth ratio (PEG). Although it is categorized under value investing, this strategy follows the principles of both growth and value investing.The PEG ratio is defined as (Price/ Earnings)/Earnings Growth RateIt relates the stocks P/E ratio with the future earnings growth rate.While P/E alone only gives an idea of stocks that are trading at a discount, PEG, while adding the growth element to it, helps to identify stocks that have solid future potential.A lower PEG ratio, preferably less than 1, is always better for GARP investors.Say for example, if a stock's P/E ratio is 10 and the expected long-term growth rate is 15%, the company's PEG will come down to 0.66, a ratio that indicates both undervaluation and future growth potential.Story continuesHowever, the question that often arises is whether the market has an adequate number of companies that are growing earnings while trading at reasonable valuations? Going by a CFA Institute Blog by Nicolas Rabener, “on average, 38% of all stocks exhibit a PEG ratio below 1, which is more than enough for security selection.”Unfortunately, this ratio is often neglected due to investors' limitations in calculating the future earnings growth rate of a stock.There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though. It does not consider the common situation of changing growth rates, such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth rate followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term.Hence, PEG-based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration.Here are five out of the 18 stocks that qualified the screening:Meta: Meta is the world’s largest social media platform. The company’s portfolio offering evolved from a single Facebook app to multiple apps like photo and video sharing app Instagram and WhatsApp messaging app owing to acquisitions.

The funding comes as part of Visa Foundation’s five-year, $200 Million Equitable Access Initiative launched in April 2020, a strategic commitment to support gender diverse and inclusive SMBs around the world. Visa Foundation will direct the grants to AfriLabs, the largest and most diverse community of technology hubs, innovators, and entrepreneurs in the African ecosystem, and Graça Machel Trust, a women founded and-led Pan African nonprofit raising the profile of women’s economic empowerment and gender-lens investment on the continent.The combined $1 Million in funding will prioritize the growth of gender diverse and inclusive small and micro businesses (SMBs) in the region. Through the Equitable Access Initiative, Visa Foundation as of January 2023 has committed $162 Million in grants and investments to 60 grantees and investees in more than 60 countries and supported 3.4 million small businesses globally, including in Africa.According to the World Bank, while Africa boasts of the highest growth rate of female-run businesses in the world, women only receive one percent of funding from VCs. Women business owners continue to face challenges that are unique to them—ranging from patriarchy, cultural norms and unconscious bias that impacts women’s ability to access markets, finance, technology and networks. The global pandemic further exacerbated these challenges as women-led SMBs were hardest hit.Story continues""Visa Foundation is working around the world with partners to eliminate barriers to capital by investing in those who have been historically excluded from economic opportunity,"" said Graham Macmillan, president, Visa Foundation. ""We’re excited to support growing women entrepreneurs in Africa through these impactful organizations that address the stark gender investment gap across the region.""Through the Visa Foundation grant, AfriLabs will fund its RevUp Women Initiative which supports early-stage, women-led startups in Africa. The initiative entails capacity-building training and mentoring to 500 beneficiaries, and 10 business owners will be selected to receive a $10,000 investment each through the Catalytic Africa matching fund. The first cohort of beneficiaries will be selected from Nigeria, Kenya, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and South Africa. The call for applications opens on February 27, 2023. According to Anna Ekeledo, AfriLabs Executive Director, ""We are pleased with the Visa Foundation's support for the initiative because it aligns with our inclusion strategy and sets the tone for our larger vision, part of which is to support 50,000 women-led enterprises by 2026.""With its funding, Graça Machel Trust will grow its flagship enterprise development program ‘Women Creating Wealth’ in Uganda, Kenya, and South Africa to reach 100 women-led, small-to-medium sized businesses. The ‘Firestarters’ initiative builds on the current investor readiness programme the organization has in place that helps ‘missing middle’ women entrepreneurs scale their businesses and galvanize action around access to capital at the country, regional and continental levels. ""We are proud to partner with Visa Foundation to break down some of the structural barriers faced by women entrepreneurs in Africa,"" said Melizsa Mugyenyi, CEO, Graça Machel Trust. ""It’s an honor for our programs to be recognized by a leading organization like Visa Foundation, with a like-minded mission of spotlighting gender-lens investment and women’s empowerment.""To learn more about Visa Foundation and its Equitable Access Initiative visit visafoundation.org.About Visa FoundationVisa Foundation seeks to support inclusive economies where individuals, businesses and communities can thrive.

In that report, analysts expect Visa to post earnings of $1.97 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 10.06%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $7.74 billion, up 7.72% from the prior-year quarter.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $8.43 per share and revenue of $32.24 billion, which would represent changes of +12.4% and +10%, respectively, from the prior year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Visa. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank.

It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

254,c1a634ee-af8d-3f32-b5ab-7293616e1c07,V,2023-03-02,Here is What to Know Beyond Why Visa Inc. (V) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-visa-inc-140002190.html,1677679202,STORY,['V'],"[Visa (V) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this global payments processor have returned -4.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -2.5% change. The Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, to which Visa belongs, has lost 3.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Visa is expected to post earnings of $1.97 per share, indicating a change of +10.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $8.43 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +12.4%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.56 indicates a change of +13.5% from what Visa is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Visa.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for V _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Visa, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $7.74 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +7.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $32.24 billion and $35.58 billion estimates indicate +10% and +10.4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVisa reported revenues of $7.94 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.4%. EPS of $2.18 for the same period compares with $1.81 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.68 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.38%. The EPS surprise was +8.46%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Visa is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Visa. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Despite the significant increase in inventory over last year's record lows, home prices are still growing, albeit at a slower pace of 7.8% over last February, a sign of still-high hopes from home sellers entering the market.What it means for homebuyers, sellers, and the housing marketIn a market with conditions that don't particularly favor buyers or sellers, both will likely have to make compromises to make a deal happen. As mortgage rates continue to fluctuate and increase the cost of buying a home, it's important for sellers to price their home appropriately to attract buyers in the market. For buyers, it's critical they make the best offer they can on a home that fits their needs and budget. Realtor.com®'s mortgage calculator can help home shoppers estimate monthly payments quickly and easily as rates change from week to week.""The number of homes for sale on the market is up significantly from a year ago, even though fewer homeowners have listed their home for sale in recent months. High home prices and mortgage rates continue to cut into buyer interest and homes are taking more than three weeks longer to sell than last year,"" said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist for Realtor.com®. ""With a smaller pool of buyers today and more competition from other homes on the market, homesellers will likely need to adjust their price expectations in the market this spring.""""For many, shopping for a new home often begins or picks up as we head into the warmer months, which is right around the corner,"" said Clare Trapasso, executive news editor at Realtor.com®. ""Potential buyers looking to take advantage of more homes to choose from and a less competitive pace also have more negotiating power than they did a year ago. So if a home has been on the market a while without receiving any offers, they may want the seller to contribute to their closing costs, make expensive repairs, or even buy down their mortgage rate.""Story continuesFebruary 2023 Housing Metrics – NationalMetricChange over Feb. 2022Change over Feb. 2019Median listing price7.8% (to $415,000)+40.1 %Active listings67.8 %-47.5 %New listings-15.9 %-23.9 %Median days on market+23 days (to 67 days)-17 daysShare of active listings with price reductions+7.6 percentage points (to 13.3%)-2.7 percentage points More options despite fewer sellers entering the marketThe supply of homes for sale continued to rise in February at a record annual pace, driven mostly by low interest from buyers facing high home and mortgage costs rather than an influx of new homes for sale to the market. Despite a significant increase in the number of homes for sale in recent months as existing home sales and demand slow, there are still fewer homes available to buy nationwide on a typical day than there were a few years ago.In February, the U.S. supply of active listings for sale rose at a record annual pace for the sixth month in a row, up 67.8% compared to last year, but it is still well below pre-pandemic levels (-47.4% compared to the February 2017-2019 average). Both newly-listed homes (-15.9%) and pending listings, or homes under contract with a buyer (-24.7%), declined year-over-year.Across the 50 largest metros, the number of homes for sale was up 86.0% compared to last February, with the most growth in active listings in the South (+141.4%).Among the 50 largest U.S. metros, 49 markets saw active inventory gains in February compared to last year, but only Las Vegas, Austin, Texas, and San Antonio saw higher levels of inventory compared to typical February 2017–2019 levels. Hartford, Conn. (-8.8%) was the only metro to see inventory decline on a year-over-year basis.Six metros saw the number of newly listed homes increase over last year, led by Raleigh, N.C. (+14.8%), Dallas (+10.3%) and San Antonio (+10.2%). The largest yearly decline in newly listed homes were in western metros, including San Jose, Calif. (-43.3%), San Francisco (-39.4%), and Seattle (-36.8%).Home price growth continues to level off as more sellers drop their asking priceWhile home prices were up in February compared to last year, year-over-year asking price growth has remained in the single digits for three months in a row, suggesting that home prices are continuing to moderate and cool down from last year's record highs. While mortgage rates are down from their November highs, rates rebounded this month and with higher home prices compared to last February, the typical monthly mortgage payment is roughly $630 more than it was a year ago. As a result of these cost pressures, the slowdown in the demand for homes means more than twice as many sellers cut their asking price in February compared to last year.The U.S. median listing price was $415,000 in February, up from $406,000 in January, and 7.8% higher than a year ago.Among the 50 largest U.S. metros, the biggest annual listing price gains were in Midwest metros (+11.9%, on average). The metros with the biggest asking price increases were Milwaukee (+48.8%), Memphis (+42.7%), and Virginia Beach (+16.3%); however, in these metros the mix of inventory also changed and more larger, expensive homes are for sale today.In February, 13.0% of active listings had their price reduced, up from 5.4% a year ago. Southern metros (+10.3 percentage points) saw the largest increase in the share of listings with price reductions.Listing prices declined in eight markets, led by Austin (-8.0% year-over-year), New Orleans (-7.0%), and Pittsburgh (-6.9%). In those markets, the median price-per-square-foot also declined on a yearly basis, signaling that price declines weren't from a rise in smaller homes for sale but by sellers adjusting their expectations and sales price.Homes take three weeks longer to sell than last yearThe housing market has cooled considerably since the height of the pandemic, when buyer demand outmatched the record low supply of homes for sale and bidding wars were common. In February, homes took more than three weeks longer to sell than they did at this time last year, despite an uptick in buyer sentiment in January. The continued slower pace of home sales signals a return to a more balanced housing market and what was considered normal before the pandemic, and it gives buyers more time to decide if a house is right for them.The typical home spent 67 days on market in February, 23 days longer than this time last year, but still 20 days faster than in February 2017-2019, on average.Relative to the national pace, time on market was lower across the 50 largest U.S. metros in February (56 days, on average) and was 19 days slower than the February 2022 pace.Compared to last year, 47 out of 50 metros saw an increase in time on market with larger metros in the West seeing the greatest increase (+26 days). Austin, Texas (+52 days), Raleigh, N.C. (+51 days), and Las Vegas and Denver (+38 days) saw the greatest increases in time on market.Only one market saw shrinking time on market and two were unchanged from last year: Hartford, Conn. (-2 days), Cincinnati, Ohio (+0 days), and Buffalo, N.Y. (+0 days).February 2023 Housing Metrics – 50 Largest U.S. Metro AreasMetro AreaMedian Listing PriceMedian Listing Price YoYMedian Listing Price per Sq. Ft.

Each received a $10,000 grant in December 2022.The funds come at an important moment after Hurricane Ian, which is estimated to be one of the costliest natural disasters of 2022, left many businesses destroyed or without the resources to rebuild. According to some estimates, up to 25 percent of small and midsize businesses could be forced to permanently close without immediate financial support.“We’re proud of our commitment and our partnerships to help small and medium size businesses continue on their path to recovery long after Ian’s initial impact,” said Aparna Khurjekar, Chief Revenue Officer, Business Markets and SaaS at Verizon Business. “Small businesses are the bedrock of the local communities we serve, and by helping them recover, we’re able to see these communities thrive once again.”“Verizon Business’s donation in the wake of Hurricane Ian has provided our community’s small businesses with critical relief as recovery efforts continue,” said Sarah Owen, President and CEO of Collaboratory. “There’s a long road ahead of us, and along with caring companies like Verizon Business, Southwest Florida will rebuild into a more resilient region.”“Small businesses are the backbone of Florida’s economy, so when tragedy strikes or natural disasters hit, like when Hurricane Ian severely impacted Southwest Florida, it’s important that companies, nonprofits, and neighbors throughout the state come together and help them recover. That’s exactly what’s been done here with this $250,000 donation from Verizon, distributed with the help of Florida TaxWatch and Collaboratory,” said Dominic M. Calabro, President and CEO of Florida TaxWatch. “Florida TaxWatch is honored to partner with Verizon and Collaboratory to advance small business resiliency and ensure that they survive and thrive in Southwest Florida.”Story continues""We are inspired by the resilience of our small business community in Lee County as they continue to rebuild and recover following Hurricane Ian. While the storm caused significant disruption, we are committed to the goal of not just bouncing back, but coming back stronger than ever before and applaud Verizon for their assistance in making this a reality,” said Brian Hamman, President &amp; CEO of the Greater Fort Myers Chamber of Commerce. “Our Chamber of Commerce stands with these businesses, offering our support and resources as we work together towards a brighter future for our community.""Small business owner Captain Ozzie Lessinger, who is one of the recipients of a $10,000 grant, said the money has been transformative not just for his fishing business, but for the entire local economy.""The fishing guide community has been hit extremely hard by Hurricane Ian,” he said. “This grant is making a huge difference for my business, and Verizon’s support of our industry is very much appreciated.”For more information, visit Verizon.com.About VerizonVerizon Communications Inc.

GoelThank you, Stacie, and welcome, everyone. Revenue for the year grew 13% over 2021, yet again outpacing the global digital ad market forecast of 8.6% growth. Omnichannel video grew 42% year-over-year and CTV alone tripled over last year as the format continues to evolve towards programmatic. These high-growth, highly profitable channels drove adjusted EBITDA margins of 38%. We generated over $87 million in net cash from operating activities and $38 million in free cash flow. Altogether, a compelling financial profile combined with ongoing targeted investments for long-term growth. The fourth quarter undoubtedly had its challenges. Performance was slightly below expectations as sharp declines in ad spend across the industry, particularly in December, impacted our business. In our case, we saw the largest sequential drop over November in the last 10 years. This primarily impacted the display portion of our business, which declined 11% over last year and continues to pressure overall growth. While omnichannel video continues to gain share at a rapid pace, display remains roughly 2/3 of our business. Revenues for our omnichannel video business in the fourth quarter continued to grow 25% year-over-year and connected TV and over-the-top streaming more than doubled over Q4 last year. These high-growth areas remain intact, and we have reorganized resources to move quickly to innovate and execute across these areas. While these long-term growth drivers will diversify our revenue over time, we believe that when ad spend growth reaccelerates, display will recover as well. While visibility is limited due to the uncertain economic environment, our business model is unique with respect to our ability to consistently generate cash and maintain 30%-plus annual adjusted EBITDA margins while also investing in future growth opportunities. We are efficient as a company and technology platform. We are highly nimble and innovative, leading in our category, and we have a strong balance sheet, coupled with a long track record of profitability. As a result, we will use the current challenging economic environment to build even deeper relationships with our customers and make highly focused innovation investments that we believe will position us for outsized gains when digital ad spend growth inevitably turns upward. Moreover, we have taken significant steps to operate within the current environment, protect our cash flow and set ourselves up for higher margins in the future. We ended 2022 with an estimated market share of 4% to 4.5%, significantly up from when we went public just over 2 years ago. We are well on our way to our stated goal from the time of our IPO of 20% market share, and we intend to use the downturn to further accelerate our gains. Stepping back, the opportunity for open Internet advertising has never been greater. Advertisers and publishers continue to seek alternatives to the walled gardens. This tailwind, along with the structural changes, including ongoing antitrust activities, will only expand our total addressable market as an independent technology provider. Moreover, consumers are increasingly seeking ad-supported content experiences to offset other household budgetary priorities. As the ecosystem grows more complex, the need for greater efficiency is driving publishers and buyers toward technologies that help them better compete. The challenges of today's macro environment will pass. And we believe the investments we make today will have exponential impact as we continue to increase the value proposition and stickiness of our platform and expand our addressable market. We have a sizable, global TAM that includes high-growth ad formats such as CTV, online video and mobile. In addition, we recently entered new markets like France, Spain, South Korea and nondomestic China. We expand our addressable market even further. We see strong signs of success in these new markets with nearly 90 customers signed in 2022 alone, such as French media company, Amaury Media, Spanish mass media company Vocento, the CTV content and ad business of electronics giant TCL, known as TCL Ffalcon and Korean addressable TV leader, SKBroadband. We have 1,600-plus publishers we already work with and continue to acquire new marquee customers such as Roku and TiVo in CTV and Kroger in Retail Media. In the slower economic environment, our priority is to deepen our relationships with existing customers and build the technical pipes or integrations with our customers for inventory and data access, so that we are in an advantaged position when ad spend growth picks up. Publishers are actively looking to add the right partners that can help them increase their revenue in these uncertain times. I have spent significant time in the last several months with a number of customers, and my view is that today's economic environment is likely to accelerate programmatic growth as publishers see greater operational efficiencies to the alternatively high cost of managing a traditional insertion order-based business. In fact, we closed 50% more new customer additions and upsells in January 2023 as compared to January 2022. Once we sign a new customer, our focus turns to expanding that relationship through our sticky portfolio of solutions such as our wrapper, mobile app SDK, identity and data solutions which further embed us into publisher monetization and workflows. Once integrated, customers continue to grow with PubMatic. In 2022, we had high publisher logo retention of 97% and benefit from a high net dollar base retention rate of 108%. We spent the last 2 years investing in our sales and customer success team. We believe we have strong market coverage in place to continue to execute and drive market share gains. We enter 2023 having significantly reduced the pace of hiring, focusing instead on a very select number of high-priority roles. At the same time, ad buyers are looking for more data-driven decision-making and measurable results. Major ad buyers are looking to consolidate their budgets with fewer partners in order to drive operational efficiency and effectiveness. The majority of ad spend comes from top agencies and advertisers. These powerhouses typically have multilayer decision-makers across multiple regions and require vast market coverage and expertise. We believe we are well positioned to gain share for 2 reasons. First, we've made the investments in our go-to-market coverage over the last 2 years, and our teams are already executing. Second, our differentiated technology, including workflow and data solutions, provide buyers with greater control over their ad budgets and ultimately, higher return on ad spend. Activity from SPO grew to over 30% in Q4 2022, up from 21% in 2020. We continue to expand our relationships with major holding companies like GroupM and Havas and recently with independent agencies like Horizon. We are 1 of only 2 independent global and omnichannel platforms at scale, and so it's quite possible that this economic environment will accelerate our SPO penetration in 2023. Let me turn now to our focus as it relates to product innovation. In 2022, we increased the number of products and features released by 30% over 2021 to almost 400, including Connect, OpenWrap for CTV and mobile app, Private Marketplaces, CTV monetization, agency-specific solutions and infrastructure upgrades. Looking to 2023, the key pillars of our focus for this year are supply path optimization and retail media. We are accelerating our cadence of product releases in these 2 areas based on product and engineering investments made over the last couple of years and our acquisition of Martin last fall. Our first priority is expanding our SPO offering. We have been hard at work integrating Martin technology, and we are receiving great feedback from agencies and advertisers and how we can help them further drive return on ad spend, measurement and operational efficiency. We will make a series of product releases for buyers on our platform over the course of this year with a particular focus on CTV and online video monetization. Our second priority is Retail Media, which is one of the fastest-growing categories within our addressable market. Over the past several quarters, we have been readying existing capabilities in on-site monetization, data management and audience targeting, specifically for retail media customers. Over the course of this year, we will make a series of product launches that brings automation, scale and efficiency to this market. There is no doubt that we are in a challenging economic environment with muted digital ad spend growth in the near term. Based on our prior experience in such downturns, however, we expect to come out of this period even better positioned. We believe this environment favors scaled companies like PubMatic that are efficient, highly innovative, nimble and profitable. Our focus on acquiring new customers and deepening integrations with existing customers as well as rapidly innovating in SPO and retail media will be well rewarded when ad spend growth reaccelerates. Importantly, we have built a durable business, and we entered this period with a very strong financial profile, generating healthy free cash flow and no debt. This attractive profile provides us with an opportunity to expand our priorities with respect to capital allocation. We operate in a large and growing market, and so we will continue to appropriately invest in the business to drive market share gains, both organically and via acquisition from time to time. In addition, we are announcing a share repurchase program that allows us to return more value to shareholders. And finally, I want to add that we have aligned our investment strategy and continue to optimize for maximum productivity in anticipation of a less robust economic environment in the second half of the year compared to what many are assuming. If the economy rebounds at a faster rate, we will adjust our plans appropriately to capture the opportunity. And now let me turn it over to Steve to provide additional detail.Steven PantelickThank you, Rajeev, and welcome, everyone. As noted by other digital ad companies, December spending across the ecosystem was uncharacteristically soft. As a result, our fourth quarter revenue was $74.3 million, down 1.7% year-over-year, driven by an 11% decline in display, which is about 2/3 of our revenues. This result was below our expectations. Importantly, our high-growth areas continue to shine. Revenue from omnichannel video grew 25% year-over-year, driven by CTV revenue, which more than doubled. At the outset of the fourth quarter, our outlook assumes continued weakness in display but not the severe industry-wide deceleration that occurred in December. Our display revenues were down 15% versus the prior December. We are taking actions to mitigate the display impact to our business. Despite these challenges, we continue to outpace the overall market and was up 13% year-over-year to a record $256.4 million. This growth was on top of 2021's growth of 53%. Significantly, we are seeing the benefits of our investments in long-term growth drivers like omnichannel video, which grew 42% year-over-year on top of 2021's growth of 79%. These investments and others have enabled us to more than double our revenues from 2019. 2022 was our seventh straight year of GAAP net income and tenth straight year of adjusted EBITDA. And notably, our business generates significant cash flow. 2022 was our ninth straight year of positive cash from operations. And since 2016, we have generated approximately $150 million in free cash flow. This consistent performance stands out amongst our peer set. Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $32.6 million, a 44% margin. We generated $19.4 million in net cash from operating activities and $7 million of free cash flow. Full year adjusted EBITDA was $98 million, a 38% margin. We generated $87.2 million in net cash from operating activities and $38.3 million of free cash flow or 15% free cash flow margin. In the last 2 years alone, we have generated $88 million of free cash flow, and that is after investing $60 million in platform infrastructure with an expected average lifetime of over 5 years. These financial results are driven by our strong publisher and buyer relationships, our diversified omnichannel platform and our owned and operated infrastructure. We have built an effective land and expand go-to-market organization and our pipeline continues to build in 2023. We focus on expanding publisher relationships and drive healthy multiyear net dollar retention rates. On a trailing 12-month basis, publisher net dollar retention was 108%, representing a robust balance between new and existing publishers. Turning to our buyers. Our supply path optimization efforts over the last several years have resulted in an increased overall ad spend and greater spend retention. Similar to our publisher strategy, once we land new SPO relationships, we successfully ramped them across formats and geographies. Viewed through the same retention lens as publishers, the net spend retention rate for SPO buyers with at least 3 years of spending has been about 124% each year. Since we pioneered SPO 4 years ago, we have retained nearly 100% of SPO ad buyers, highlighting the stickiness of our platform and the increased value we bring to them. The diversity of our platform is a key strength. Our omnichannel video revenue span across desktop, mobile and CTV devices and was 34% of revenues in Q4, up from 22% of revenues in Q1 2021. From a device perspective, mobile advertising revenues across all formats increased to 57% of revenues in Q4 2022, up from 53% of revenues in Q1 2021. We are also well diversified across ad verticals, which contributes to our resiliency. For example, in Q4, we saw Automotive and Food &amp; Drink both grew 25% year-over-year. This growth helped offset weakness in Shopping, Technology and Personal Finance, which in aggregate declined 13% year-over-year. Overall, our top 10 ad verticals were flat in the fourth quarter compared to last year. Another source of strength is our geographic diversity. In Q4, EMEA revenues increased 11.5% year-over-year, partially offsetting the decline in the U.S. Earlier in the year, Americas growth helped balance softness in EMEA and APAC. For the full year, all regions expanded revenues by double digits. Now turning to our operational strength, which gives us several significant levers in our business that allow us to maintain 30% plus annual adjusted EBITDA margins, generate healthy cash flows and invest for continued long-term growth in an expanding addressable market. First, by owning and operating our infrastructure, we have significant leverage and operational control, a key competitive differentiator for us. Since 2019, we have invested approximately $90 million to expand our impression capacity and platform capabilities. This has allowed us to grow our market share. For example, over the last 3 years, we increased the number of impressions we processed by over 400% to capitalize on our expanded publisher relationships. In 2023, our focus is on leveraging prior investments and driving increased optimization through the software and hardware layers. These efforts will further increase capacity while reducing our CapEx by more than 50%. We anticipate seeing a margin benefits in the second half. We also expect our optimization efforts will lead to further margin expansion next year. Second, we operate a highly efficient and productive development organization in India. We estimate that we are saving over $30 million per year, building software using our India team versus deploying those resources onshore. Over 80% of our tech hiring in 2022 was in India, which rolled out 30% more product releases last year. And third, with our long-term focus on profitability, we take a nimble approach to managing our business. In the second half of 2022, we moved quickly to adjust our expense structure and investment plans once it became clear that overall ad spending growth was trending down. These actions contributed about $10 million to our bottom line by the end of 2022. Our operating plans for 2023 call for a significant reduction in the pace of hiring as compared to 2022. Q4 GAAP OpEx was $34.8 million or 13% increase year-over-year. Excluding stock-based compensation costs and acquisition-related costs, operating expense growth was 4%. Full year GAAP OpEx was $134.3 million or a 22% increase year-over-year. Excluding stock-based compensation costs and acquisition-related costs, operating expense growth was 16%. Q4 marked our 15th straight quarter of GAAP net income and was $12.8 million or 17% net margin. Full year net income was $28.7 million or 11% net margin. Q4 non-GAAP net income, which adjusts for unrealized gain or loss on equity investments, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other expenses and related adjustments for income taxes, was $18.7 million or 25% of revenue. Full year non-GAAP net income was $52.2 million or 20% margin. Q4 diluted EPS was $0.22 and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.33. 2022 diluted EPS was $0.50 and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.92. Turning to cash. Since our IPO 26 months ago, we have generated more than $180 million in cash from operations. We have used this cash for working capital, investments in long-term organic growth and the acquisition of Martin. At the end of 2022, we had $174 million in cash and marketable securities and no debt. Our priority is to drive shareholder value. There is no shortage of opportunities in our huge industry with years of growth ahead, and you will see us continue to drive growth and gain market share, both organically and from time to time via M&amp;A. In addition, our Board of Directors has approved the repurchase of up to $75 million of our Class A common stock through the end of 2024. Now turning to our 2023 outlook. There is considerable uncertainty about the trajectory for your digital ad spend this year due to the pronounced December weakness and persistent overhang of macro headwinds across the globe. Display, in particular, continues to see pressure. These trends and challenging conditions have led to a wide range of industry forecast for 2023. Given these circumstances, we have built our investment plan, assuming a low to mid-single-digit rate of growth for digital advertising in 2023. We anticipate continued softness in the first half followed by tempered improvement in the second half. Overall, the plan we have in place is expected to deliver 3 important outcomes: one, generate similar free cash flow as we get in 2022; two, position us for revenue acceleration when ad spend stabilizes; and three, establish a new level of efficiency in our cost structure that will lead to margin expansion by the end of 2023 and beyond. For Q1 2023, we anticipate revenue to be in the range of $50 million to $52 million. December weakness continued into January, with display revenue down 13% over January 2022. Online video also started the year off slowly and was down in January year-over-year. CTV continued its strong trajectory and grew double digits. Overall, omnichannel video grew year-over-year. From a regional perspective, EMEA thus has grown double digits year-over-year, while both the Americas and APAC were down. Over the last several weeks, we have seen trends improve sequentially over January. If these trends continue, we anticipate that Q2 revenues will sequentially increase by approximately 10%, in line with our historical 10-year average. In light of this, we have taken actions to drive our incremental productivity across every aspect of our business. We expect to reduce CapEx by over 50% compared to 2022 and reduce our discretionary spend plans. In addition, we have reorganized our go-to-market and technology teams to apply incremental resources towards the fastest-growing areas in video, including CTV, supply path optimization and retail media. GAAP cost of revenue in Q1 will grow sequentially from Q4 by approximately $1.4 million due to the full quarter impact of year-end 2022 CapEx and inflation cost increases passed through by our colo providers that took effect in January. Over the coming quarters, as a function of proactive steps on productivity and cost saving measures, we anticipate keeping sequential cost increases in the low single digits. We expect Q1 GAAP OpEx to increase approximately $7 million versus Q4. This increase absorbs the Q4 run rate of expense, incremental Martin expense plus an additional cost related to our January Global Sales Conference. We anticipate Q2 OpEx will be lower than Q1 by about $1 million with sequential increases in the low single digits thereafter. Excluding stock-based compensation and Martin acquisition-related costs, Q1 non-GAAP OpEx will be $4 million higher versus Q4. Given our revenue guidance and our cost structure, which is largely fixed in the near term by design, we expect our Q1 adjusted EBITDA to be between $4 million and $6 million or approximately 10% margin at the midpoint. As a reminder, historically, our first quarter is impacted by prior year investments carried forward during a period of low seasonal ad spend. We expect profitability to improve as the year progresses, driven by the full effect of our cost reductions, optimizations and typical seasonal increases in ad spend. We anticipate Q3 and Q4 adjusted EBITDA margin levels to be above 30%. For the full year, we expect adjusted EBITDA margin to be over 30%. We also expect CapEx to be $13 million to $16 million for the full year, more than 50% lower than 2022. As I mentioned earlier, we have built our plan, assuming low to mid-single-digit growth in digital ad spend this year. As a leading technology platform, we expect to continue to outpace the market rate of growth and gain share as a result. Accordingly, to the extent that industry growth rates are higher than our current assumption, we would expect to grow faster. In addition, the recently announced closure of several sell-side platforms gives us even greater opportunity for incremental share gains over time, which are not included in our current 2023 expectations. We have strong publisher and buyer relationships, a diversified omnichannel platform and a durable business model. We anticipate that the work we are doing now to increase productivity and leverage prior investments will result in margin expansion and increased cash flows later this year and well into 2024. With that, I'll turn the call over to Stacie.Question and Answer SessionStacie Clements(Operator Instructions) With that, I'll start the queue off with Jason Helfstein, Oppenheimer.Jason Stuart HelfsteinI'm just going to ask one. Can you elaborate on your deal with Roku you mentioned in the release? Does this cover all of their own inventories such as the Roku Channel? How fast can this ramp and just broad dots because it would unlock a significant amount of inventory for you?Rajeev K. GoelJason, this is Rajeev. So I can take that. So I can't go into too many details on the -- some of the specific aspects of what you're asking. But we see an opportunity to work with Roku across a wide variety of inventory, whether it's their own inventory on Roku Channel or inventory they own on other channels in addition to already working with other content owners channels, inventory that flows through Roku. So I think all multiple aspects are open, and we think it can be a really significant relationship in 2023.Stacie ClementsAnd our next question comes from Justin Patterson from KeyBanc.Justin Tyler PattersonI guess, it came up towards the end of your comments, Steve, but would love to hear your thoughts and Rajeev, just around -- opportunities around vendor consolidation. Obviously, there have been some bankruptcies. We are seeing publishers like Yahoo! shut down the SSP side of the business. I think that was about 13% of your revenue last year. So would love to hear how you're thinking about just vendor consolidation as an opportunity over the course of the year.Rajeev K. GoelYes, I can kick that off. And Steve, feel free to add anything. So as you mentioned, right, Yahoo! announced that they plan to close their own SSP. I think on the same day, we also saw EMX, a much smaller player, declared bankruptcy. And those are obviously 2 items that grab headlines, but there's plenty of other kind of consolidation stories happening in the background.So specifically as it relates to Yahoo!, there's 2 parts of Yahoo!'s SSP. There's owned and operated inventory and then there's third-party inventory. But as it relates to the third-party publisher inventory, we analyze their publisher base and there's a very high degree of overlap with publishers that we already work with. And so Yahoo!'s SSP, conventional closure will eliminate a path for buyers to those publishers via the Yahoo! SSP, and we expect the ad spend that runs through that path will be redistributed to other SSPs, and we would expect to gain share as a result. And then the other piece is the Yahoo! owned and operated inventory, which is the bigger share. And we've consistently been a strong monetization partner for Yahoo!. And Yahoo! has publicly said that they will rely more on third-party SSPs going forward. And so I would expect that their closure will open up more opportunity for us to work with Yahoo!, could be in wrapper solution, data solutions or PMP platform and their owned and operated inventories, primarily mobile web and mobile app, which are 2 areas of strength for us. So just keep in mind, though, that Yahoo! is not planning to shut this down until the end of the year. And so in both cases, we expect share gains that's not built into our expectations for 2023. Now more broadly, I think what we see very clearly is whether it's via SPO or some of these recent SSP closures is that the industry is consolidating down to fewer bigger platforms, and we certainly see ourselves as a winner in that process, as recognized by our historical share gains and what we expect to see in the future. And I think this kind of economic environment will really only accelerate the consolidation that we've all felt should be happening in the sell side of the ecosystem and has already occurred in the buy side.Stacie ClementsOur next question comes from Shweta Khajuria at Evercore.Shweta R. KhajuriaOkay. Let me try 2, please. One is, could you talk about more specifics around the investments you're doing for SPO as well as retail media. So you did talk about several topics. But what specifically are you investing towards? And what are you doing there? And then for Steve, for Q4, was political any meaningful impact at all? I know it's not that big for you, but could you quantify that? And second, how do you think about margin expansion, key leverage areas and sustainable margins going forward beyond '23?Rajeev K. GoelSure. So yes, Shweta, let me start with your question around investments in SPO and retail media. So as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, given the macroeconomic environment, we are getting more focused in terms of our innovation investments and these are 2 specific areas. So as it relates to SPO building on the prior question from Justin, we just see more opportunity for spend consolidation to happen on fewer bigger SSPs and we obviously have been driving that trend with SPO. We plan to continue to drive that. And so really, what we're focused on is what are the high-value and high-growth ad formats, things like online video and CTV where we can better connect the publisher and the buyer. And so that can be through bringing the seller and the buyer closer together, less latency, fewer hops of inventory, better measurement and verification of what a buyer -- what type of inventory they're buying, their ability to curate specific audience sets or media sets on our platform, so that they know exactly what they're buying and the price that they're paying for it. So we see just a whole slew of innovation opportunities to help us get closer or help the publisher and the buyer get closer together and remove friction from the transaction process. Now as it relates to retail media, there's both an on-site and an off-site focus that we have. So with on-site, obviously, there's many retailers that are running ads on their websites, both display or video ads as well as sponsored listings. And then from an offsite perspective, they usually want to extend those audiences off-site, and we see opportunity to play in all of those areas, in addition to data management, identity management, which is an area that we've been building in over the last couple of years. And so we think some of the use cases are becoming more clear, specifically in the retail media space.Steven PantelickGreat. Shweta, nice to reconnect. So with respect to the first question around political spend, you're right, it doesn't amount to a lot on our platform in the fourth quarter, it was a couple of million dollars, I would say, describe it as slightly below our expectations, but we had not assumed a significant uptick in any case, relatively de minimis. And as I shared in my comments, the big driver of our Q4 results was display and really, December was a big step down from a trend perspective and largely driven by lower CPMs. Some of you'd expect when it's a demand-driven challenge with lower bidding activity, lower prices, et cetera. Now stepping back, we have been very proactive over the last couple of quarters in anticipation of the trends that we saw emerging, and we took steps in '22 to reduce costs in key areas. And in effect, repurpose them, reprioritize to the high-growth areas that Rajeev has described. And we feel really good about the progress we've made there. And we've also commented on the significant reduction in CapEx in '23 that we're planning, which will be long-term driver of our margin. And so when you step back and think about where we are as a company and the industry, we've been through multiple economic cycles like this. And what we've learned is that ad spending from a programmatic perspective always comes back bigger and more of a part of the future of digital ad spending. And so we're taking this time right now to selectively invest in areas that we think will have long-term growth potential as well as make those adjustments to the model. And so I fully expect over time, we'll be able to expand our gross margin, getting more productivity out of our infrastructure; number two, related to some of the changes we made around prioritization of head count that will have some benefit over the next couple of quarters. But ultimately, the opportunity ahead of us is significant. And so we do anticipate a challenging next couple of quarters, but we're laying the groundwork for margin expansion later this year and into '24 along a variety of parameters.Stacie ClementsOur next question comes from Matt Swanson, RBC.Matthew John SwansonYes. I think maybe I'll try to focus on the secular growth drivers. It seems like macro is kind of anybody's guess still. So on the CTV side, it's been great to see the expansion of publishers throughout the year. But could you maybe give us some color on what that revenue distribution looks like within that number? Is it 90% from 10 publishers or evenly distributed between just kind of some dynamics of how we should be thinking about that number?Rajeev K. GoelYes, sure. It's definitely not evenly distributed. And I think, as you know well, right, in the media industry, there tends to be a degree of concentration. But I would say that our strategy has been to go after a programmatic approach to CTV. And so what that's meant is actually some of the smaller publishers are the first to embrace that. Publishers that are not incumbents that don't have big TV businesses or legacy sales forces. And so it's pretty well distributed. And then over time, and certainly, one of the things that we see, particularly in this economic environment is a much bigger embrace of programmatic monetization among some of the leading broadcasters, right? So as obviously, their revenues are coming under pressure, they're thinking about what can they do differently. And time and again, what we've seen is that programmatic is more efficient, it's more transparent. It delivers more ROI to advertisers. And so I think we're going to see very much an acceleration towards programmatic this year and next year, and that will, in part, be with some of the biggest players. And so I would expect that actually concentration might move up over time among some of those bigger media players, but we're approaching it from a perspective of bringing quite broadly diversified.Matthew John SwansonYes. No, that's really helpful context, especially into 2023, that maybe the absolute number becomes a little less important in some of the qualitative context around the size of the new ads. I guess on the other side, thinking about some of the secular growth drivers, we've done our SPO, but I think that expansion rate was super helpful, though -- Rajeev or Steve, I don't know who wants to take it. But if there any color you can give us on kind of the specific drivers of that number? Like is it just volume-based? And how do you kind of more broadly think that number trends over time?Steven PantelickYes. We are very excited about that metric. And the -- a couple of things that are very positive about it. One, the metric that we shared regarding the retention. So once we've signed up an SPO buyer, we have close to 100% retention over multiple years. And so that really underscores value exchange. It conveys the stickiness of the efforts that we're doing with SPO buyers. And the metric that I shared was around spend. So it's dollar-based. And it's very positive in that we're seeing consistent upticks from those SPO buyers over time. And so that's one factor. The other factor is that we're constantly adding new buyers into the SPO initiative. And of course, we talked to you about the areas that we are continuing to invest in around SPO. So as we've shared in the past, SPO is absolutely a strategic imperative for us. We were a pioneer. And now when we can look back at those metrics and see that our assessment and our investments that we've made are paying off, gives us confidence that this will be -- continue to be a long-term tailwind for us. And it was terrific to see that the share of overall spend was over 30% for full year '22, and we expect that to grow in '23.Stacie ClementsAnd our next question comes from James Heaney at Jefferies.James Edward HeaneyJust a couple on guidance. I really appreciate the commentary on January and February trends, but curious if the Q1 guide assumes conditions remain relatively stable or continue to improve sequentially. And then as it relates to the rest of the year, you're saying you're expecting to grow -- to outgrow the industry's low to mid-single digits. So does that imply we're just going to see a big step up in the second half and what gives you the conviction that, that plays out?Steven PantelickSure. Well, nice to reconnect, James. So from our perspective, we're taking a look at the trends for January, February, and they have stabilized, as I shared my comments, February improved versus January, and we anticipate that stability continuing into March. By and large, our expectation is that advertisers have already locked and loaded their plans for the quarter. So the guidance we gave doesn't assume any further, let's call it, acceleration or improvement nor decel. So we're feeling like we're representing sort of what we think is going to happen. Now stepping back and looking at the full year, I mean, clearly, there's a lot of different data points out there, different participants, different forecasts. And so we built a plan predicated on an assumption around single to mid-digit growth. And we anticipate in the first half, there's going to be challenging conditions, and there will be some incremental improvements in the second half. And the improvements we believe will be a part of sort of advertisers getting more comfortable with the macro environment and understanding where they're getting return on dollars. And we know that historically, programmatic advertising delivers high ROI, and I think that you'll start to see advertisers recognize that and deploy dollars. I think you'll also see more dollars move from social over into digital and into our area of open Internet. And so we don't expect like a huge inflection point, but some tempered improvement in the second half. And that, of course, overlays with the normal seasonality that just exists in our industry where you have the higher second half seasonal spending.Stacie ClementsOur next question comes from Andrew Boone at JMP.Andrew M. BooneI'll keep it to one. Can you talk a little bit about the underlying take rates for the business? I understood that SPO is going to be a headwind there. But on more of a like-for-like basis, are you guys seeing any change in the actual economics as it relates to the business?Steven PantelickThe great news, Andrew, is that we are not. I mean when I sign contracts, and I've reflected on this over the last, let's call it, 9 months year. The revenue share rates that we are achieving are on par, if not better, than prior trends. So we feel really good about the value that we are delivering. And so from our perspective, the investments that we're making in terms of valuable formats around omnichannel video focusing on working with the big head of the market publishers and establishing these deep relationships with buyers is really underpinning sort of our ability to continue to maintain the economics that we've had for some period of time.Stacie ClementsAnd our next question comes from Andrew Marok at Raymond James.Andrew Jordan MarokI'd like to drill down a little bit on the geographic revenue trends. Given that EMEA actually grew double digits year-over-year in 4Q despite still experiencing what I think are fairly similar macro headwinds in the rest of the world. Anything really to call out there as to why that fared better than the U.S. and APAC, particularly?Steven PantelickSure. A couple of things. First, we've been investing in our EMEA business for some time. Rajeev commented on a couple of new markets that we entered on the continent. And it's an environment where they faced a lot of challenges, let's call it the end of '21, early '22, and they've been really figuring out how to operate successfully in that market. So that's sort of on a macro level.But on the specific level, one of the things that we saw is that, frankly, display did not get as impacted as it did in the Americas. And that sort of wasn't the drag that it was. Just as a frame of reference, when we last spoke in early November at our last earnings call, at that point, we had assumed that display was going to be slightly worse than what we saw in October, November for the balance of the quarter. That was low to mid-single-digit decline. What actually occurred was minus 15% in December. EMEA buck that trend, and that's a function, I believe, of sort of just in terms of timing, but also establishing some new relationships in market. And so overall, what really is important to us is that we have a global business that in any one period of time, where there's challenges, let's say, in 1 area, there is the possibility of an offset, and that's exactly what we saw in the fourth quarter of '22, and that's what we're seeing right now in the first quarter of '23. EMEA is doing very well right now on a year-over-year basis. And of course, there's the other component of the typical rollout of incremental products on a global basis, going from the Americas to EMEA, and EMEA starting to ramp up around CTV, online video. So we have a confluence of factors again, underpinning our approach and the reasons that we are confident in our ability to deliver the kinds of financial targets that we have for ourselves in the long run.Andrew Jordan MarokGreat. That's really helpful. And then one more quick one, if I could. Kind of on the commentary around the trajectory of revenue growth trends as we walk through '23. Obviously, retail media is an investment area, likely to be a focused investment area, at least in the first half of the year. But how much of that easing of revenue growth trajectories and things like that in the second half of the year, does retail media contribute to?Steven PantelickSo we very much see retail media as an emerging area. So we have not baked in a significant incremental revenues from retail media. So to the extent to which that accelerates, that will be an upside.Stacie ClementsAnd our next question comes from Eric Martinuzzi from Lake Street.Eric MartinuzziYes. I wanted to dive into the uses of capital. First, on the buyback, just to -- if I could better understand the logic behind the $75 million number, is that just kind of a split balling on 2 years' worth of the free cash flow? And then I had a follow-up question on the CapEx.Steven PantelickNo. I mean we obviously went through a very judicious disciplined effort to come up with the number in consultation with the Board. I mean at the end of the day, our job is to be good stewards of the capital that we have and deliver shareholder value. And so we took a look at our ability to generate cash, our ability to grow and still invest and not miss out on opportunities. And we looked at this as a multiyear plan. And so we found that this number, $75 million was a good balance to accomplish that. And at the end of the day, we are trying to figure out the right mechanics, and we feel really good about sort of our ability to grow and our cash position allowed us to deliver value to our shareholders as well via this repurchase program.Eric MartinuzziOkay. And then on the CapEx, I think last year, 2022, $36 million. This year, you're talking $13 million to $16 million, what do we miss out on with such a dramatic pullback in the capital -- equipment per capital?Steven PantelickYes, it's a great question. And the answer is we don't believe we're missing out on anything. And I'll tell you why. So over the last couple of years, we've been as a function of growth and the opportunity that we saw ahead of us, we were very aggressive in terms of building out our infrastructure to the tune of close to $80-plus million over a number of years. And we now have infrastructure to handle all the opportunities that we have ahead of us and then room to grow. And so what we've decided to do is to continue to leverage those prior investments through various optimizations on the software side and the hardware side. And we will have incremental capacity as a result of that without the large price tag of just using hardware. And we're going to see how it goes. And if it's something that goes well for us, then we're going to emulate that and continue to do that in the future. And so really, what you see is a company that is very successful in owning and operating its own infrastructure and taking more opportunities to pull levers. And it turns out that there's a huge opportunity that will have a clear path to revenue in '24 and beyond that would have a CapEx taken along with it. We'll take a hard look at that. But right now, we're feeling really good about the incremental capacity that we have in our system, the optimization that we can do to that to deliver more upside opportunity today. And that really goes to the point that I made earlier regarding our margin expansion. If this is successful, and we'll be able to continue to get more and more impact from our existing infrastructure.Stacie ClementsAt this time, we're coming up to the top of the -- or to the hour. I am going to turn the call back over to Rajeev for closing remarks.Rajeev K. GoelThank you, Stacie. Well, we are energized by our ongoing market share gains. Ad spend growth will inevitably accelerate and our strategy is to make measured investments that will best position us for outsized growth when that happens. We're focused on deepening our relationships with existing customers while adding new ones and making focused product investments in supply path optimization, including CTV as well as retail media. The plan we have in place is expected to deliver 3 important outcomes: generate similar free cash flow as we did in 2022, position us for revenue acceleration when ad spend stabilizes and establish a new level of efficiency in our cost structure that will lead to margin expansion by the end of 2023 and beyond. Thank you to our analysts and investors for your continued support. We look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming investor events, including the JMP Securities Technology Conference in San Francisco on March 7, the KeyBanc Emerging Technology Conference in SF on March 8 and the Lake Street Virtual NDR on March 15. Feel free to reach out directly to those firms or through Stacie and [Keenan] with Investor Relations. Thank you all for joining us today.]"

In the most recent test measuring performance of the major wireless carriers throughout Louisville, Verizon not only wins for overall network performance, but is unbeaten in every single category measured including accessibility, speed, reliability and performance in texts and calls. Today’s results show remarkable speeds for Verizon customers in Louisville with Verizon’s median download speed increasing 211% in the market and Verizon’s median upload speeds increasing by more than 40% since last year*.“Whether our customers are enjoying connecting with friends and family while on the move, connecting their smart homes through one of our home internet products or using our service in Louisville for small business or enterprise applications, we know customers count on us,” said Dean Brauer, Vice President of Engineering and Operations for Verizon. “Our team has been working hard in Louisville to deliver these results, and we are not slowing down.”Network enhancements in LouisvilleOver one million residents in Louisville have access to Verizon’s 5G Ultra Wideband service deployed on Verizon’s C-band spectrum allowing customers to do everything from downloading huge documents and seamlessly streaming movies in HD audio and video, to playing console quality games and conducting video chats and video conferencing calls with clear sound and video while on the move. In addition to the widespread deployment of 5G using C-band spectrum, Verizon engineers also added 5G using mMWave, Verizon’s premium high-band spectrum designed to provide 5G for high density areas, to 79 small cell sites throughout the market to complement the 400 sites which previously provided 5G service with mmWave.Story continuesIn addition to all the 5G additions to cell sites in the area, Verizon engineers constructed three new macro cell sites providing additional coverage and capacity to the very busy area of Shepherdsville, KY along I-65 and the Fern Creek area along I-265.Guests enjoying the pageantry of Churchill Downs, the family entertainment at the Kentucky Fair and Expo Center, the buzzer beaters at the KFC YUM! Center, or the heart-pounding end zone plays at Cardinal stadium will now be able to enjoy better performance on their mobile devices while attending events. Verizon engineers enhanced in-building systems at each of those venues adding capacity to all and 5G service in some of those locations.Lastly, the addition of 5G service and the many additional wireless solutions allow far more data to travel on the wireless network in Louisville, and that exponential increase in data carried into and out of the cell sites serving the community need upgraded fiber optic cable links.  Fiber optic cables are used to move data between cell sites and connect those sites to the rest of the network.  Verizon has increased the capacity on the fiber connections in many cell sites in the Louisville area so they can carry 10 times the amount of data.Services from the network customers rely onFor customers in Louisville, the additional coverage and capacity means more customers now have access not only to reliable, fast mobile service, but also Verizon Home Internet service, a different kind of home internet with truly unlimited broadband service and no data caps. It’s ideal for anyone who wants super fast connectivity to stream, game or even work remotely. Additionally, through Verizon Frontline, first responders in the Louisville area will also be able to experience the benefits of these network enhancements.

In the most recent test measuring performance of the major wireless carriers throughout Lancaster, Verizon not only wins for overall network performance, but is unbeaten in every single category measured including accessibility, speed, reliability and performance in texts and calls. Today’s results mark the 10th testing period in a row over the course of five years Verizon’s network is unbeaten in Lancaster.""These results reinforce what many of our customers already know: Verizon consistently provides Lancaster the best network experience,"" said Julie Slattery, Vice President of Engineering and Operations for Verizon. “We know customers rely on our service and our engineers are working daily to ensure customers have the experience they need and expect from us.”Network enhancements in LancasterThese top marks are a result of months of deploying new enhancements in the network for those who live in and visit the Lancaster area. Network engineers have been busy deploying 5G Ultra Wideband service throughout Lancaster, adding the service to more than 50 cell sites in the last few months.In addition to adding 5G service to the market, engineers have been busy expanding wireless service, erecting multiple macro and small cells throughout the market. This additional coverage provides service near Oregon Pike around Rte 30 and Rte 272, in the town of Conestoga, in Manor Township along Charlestown Road, eastern side of the town of Lititz, PA, along Rte 372 and Rte 272 south of Buck, PA and near Rohrerstown Road and Rte 741.These deployments used recently acquired C-band spectrum. Until this year in Lancaster, Verizon has been restricted to using 60 MHz of the spectrum they secured, but by the end of this year, customers in Lancaster will be able to take advantage of 100 MHz of C-band, almost doubling the spectrum available for 5G Ultra Wideband. That additional spectrum will turbo charge the service, offering significantly higher speeds, much greater capacity to accommodate more customers and more robust services.Story continuesEven as engineers provide wireless service in more places, they are also enhancing the service by deploying leading edge, modernized technology in the area. Engineers have upgraded the hardware in many of the cell sites providing service throughout Lancaster adding capacity for more data to be used by customers, providing power efficiency, and providing virtualization. This technology milestone allows Verizon to rapidly respond to customers’ varied latency and computing needs, and provides greater flexibility and agility in the introduction of new products and services. The move to a cloud-based, virtualized architecture with standardized interfaces in every part of the network leads to greater flexibility, faster delivery of services, greater scalability, and improved cost efficiency in networks.Lastly, the addition of 5G service and the many additional wireless solutions allow far more data to travel on the wireless network in Lancaster.

The mission of the group is to celebrate LGBTQIA+ employees and allies at Tapestry by building an inclusive community across all brands; encouraging, supporting, and mentoring others at work; connecting our identity with brand products that speak to us; and supporting our local communities through philanthropic volunteering.In the February 2023 issue of LOUDLY, Prouder Together's newsletter for Tapestry employees, Jesse DeBusk, Coach Store Manager, caught up with the lead supervisor and social media influencer for Coach, located in Portland, Oregon, Curtlynn Gonzalez (she/her). Together, Jesse and Curtylynn discussed everything from their favorite things about Tapestry, Zero Discrimination, and Trans Visibility Day, and took a deep dive into Curtlynn's life as a drag performer. Safe to say, Curtlynn is a fantastic representative of the brand and a phenomenal advocate for people of trans experience.Learn more about life at Tapestry here: https://www.tapestry.com/responsibility/our-people/What's your story?""I was born in Los Angeles, the youngest of 10 children. Growing up I wanted to be on Broadway for as long as I can remember. I was always an eccentric kid, randomly dancing and being the loudest in the room. When I turned 14 I decided to come out to my parents and was kicked out of my home. With some help from my sibling, I made it up to Portland where I was placed in Foster Care as my parents made it clear to me and to the courts that they did not want an LGBTQIA+ child. Being in multiple different foster homes and putting myself through high school wasn't easy but made my journey oh so rewarding. I am now 26 years old and am so proud of the obstacles I've overcome, and am so grateful to be living in my truth and getting to share my story.""What's your favorite part about your city/ community?Story continues""I am very fortunate to live in a city where diversity is celebrated and encouraged. And while Portland has its fair share of issues, it has always been a city with an openness to new ideas and a safe place for LGBQIA+ people.""What have been the most joyful parts of your transition journey for you?""Living in my truth unabashedly has been so healing to me because like any endeavor, you don't truly know what it's like until you're there, all you show up with is excitement, expectations, and often fear. For me, one of the most joyful parts of my transition journey has been seeing what truly loving myself has done to my smile. I used to not show many teeth when cracking a smile and now I can't help but smile wide from ear to ear. Seeing my fears be answered with love and support has been incredible.""What were/are the challenges you faced as you began your transition?""When I began my transition, EVERYTHING felt like a challenge, but like all challenges, they come with a sense of excitement and reward when overcome. Some of the challenges I faced were people misgendering me and people struggling to remember/use my new Chosen name, subsequently using my DEADNAME. For those that do not know, a dead name is the birth name of someone who has opted to change their name as part of THEIR gender transition. In many cases, this name stays their legal name, but it no longer resonates or feels comfortable to them.""What are some of the things that allies and those within the LGBTQIA+ Community could do to better support transgender employees at work?""When a child says they're in pain, we don't question whether they're telling the truth, we simply believe them and help how we can. Similarly, Transgender people are among some of the most vulnerable within our community, so it is that much more important to listen to us when we're asking for help. We often don't get the same support outside of our regular support systems. Show up for us and play your part in creating a space where ALL feel welcome and all feel supported.""Who is your biggest role model? ""My biggest role model is my Drag Mom, Sheniqua Volt. She is a BIPOC Transgender woman who has been doing drag for over 20 years. She taught me to walk tall and confident and to be proud of what I bring to the table as the woman that I am.""What are some of the microaggressions transgender people face in the workplace?A lot of the microaggressions transgender people face at work often revolve around our appearance and our bodies. Transgender people, even transgender women are not monolithic. Not everyone is going to vie for the same transition journey. Some may choose to medically transition, and some don't, for myriad reasons from personal choice to lacking financial access.What makes you proud to be a part of Tapestry?""The thing that makes me the proudest of working for Tapestry is getting to have the confidence to show up to work every day and never having to worry about what my company or my direct coworkers think of me as a Person of Trans Experience. When I started here I remember I was given a pin that said ""Open To All"" and that truth could not have been more accurate. Getting to show up as my authentic self every day had a huge impact not just on me but within our community. Getting to host a Pride happy hour last year and seeing the impact and exposure we had was iconic. I have had the privilege since coming out to meet many members of the LGBTQIA+ within our store many of which are in awe at seeing a woman like me at work just living my best life. That's the greatest gift of all.""A big thank you to Curtlynn for her willingness to educate and share her story!

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Motley Fool's 5 High Growth Stock Picks. According to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. strategists, the significant outperformance of cheaper, value stocks over growth stocks from the previous year is expected to reverse soon as the pace of economic recovery slows down. The value trade, which was a popular investment strategy in 2022, is beginning to lose its appeal. As a result, JPMorgan’s team led by Mislav Matejka suggested that investors may need to consider reducing their exposure to value stocks compared to growth stocks in the next one or two months. They recommend going ""outright underweight value versus growth,"" as stated in a note. Mislav Matejka further wrote in a note: “Our core view is that in the second half, market will be moving back to the recession trade, but even if the opposite scenario gains traction, value might not be the best place to be.”After significantly outperforming growth stocks last year by the largest margin since the dotcom bubble in 2000, the performance of value stocks has begun to slow down in comparison. Although value stocks received a boost from rising bond yields and inflation, investors are becoming more cautious due to concerns about a potential hawkish policy. This may lead to a decrease in support for the value trade as bond yields reach their peak. The current pace of economic activity is likely to reach its peak and could start to decline soon. Additionally, the stall in inflation expectations implies that the value factor may not perform as well relative to growth in the future.Motley Fool Asset Management prioritizes investing in high-quality companies with strong growth potential. The company regularly evaluates its current portfolio holdings and adjusts them based on prevailing stock market trends, with the aim of optimizing gains and minimizing losses. Some of the top high growth stock picks of Motley Fool include Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Atlassian Corporation (NASDAQ:TEAM), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).

Payment volume grew 21% in local currency (excluding Russia) as consumer spending remained resilient and the international travel recovery continued as border restrictions were lifted.

The company’s cloud-based human capital management and payroll software solutions help businesses manage through broad labor shortages and provide solutions to retain talent. However, as excess slack in the labor market has begun to be absorbed, investments in human resources solutions have declined. Additionally, we believe Paylocity continues to have a compelling long-term growth runway as it attracts new customers and gains market share against large, mature competitors.”8. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)3-year Revenue Growth: 54.9%Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is a California-based customer relationship management technology firm. It is one of Motley Fool’s top high growth stock picks. The hedge fund raised its stake in Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) by 209% in the fourth quarter of 2022, holding 70,533 shares worth $9.35 million. As of March 1, Wall Street analysts expect Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) to report a profit, excluding one-time items, of $1.36 per share, on revenue of $7.99 billion. During the prior-year quarter, the company earned 84 cents a share, on $7.33 billion in revenue.On February 24, BMO Capital analyst Keith Bachman raised the firm's price target on Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) to $185 from $172 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares ahead of its earnings. According to the analyst's research note, continued strong margins may be a significant factor in driving the stock higher as growth stabilizes at a high-single-digit rate. Additionally, the firm believes that Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)’s large size gives it an advantage over other SaaS vendors in terms of brand recognition, sales, and cost management.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 117 hedge funds were bullish on Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), and Harris Associates held the largest stake in the company, with 8.14 million shares worth $1 billion. Aristotle Atlantic made the following comment about Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We sold Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) to reduce our weighting in the Information Technology sector. Salesforce held their investor day, and the company reiterated their organic Fiscal Year 2026 revenue target of $50 billion. This target remains more back-end loaded based on current slowing macroeconomic conditions and requires new annual contract growth well ahead of what the company has been averaging for the past few years. We are skeptical that the company will be able to achieve this revenue target organically and see Merger &amp; Acquisitions (M&amp;A) being key to achieving the growth. While we believe Salesforce has shown good success in growing its non-CRM clouds, we do see more competitive pressures emerging for the Marketing and Customer Service Clouds, specifically on the pricing side during a global economic slowdown.”7. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)3-year Revenue Growth: 55.0%Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the top high growth stocks in Motley Fool Asset Management’s Q4 portfolio. The hedge fund owns 448,001 shares of the tech giant, worth nearly $40 million and representing 4.48% of the total 13F securities. The average 3-year revenue growth for Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) between 2020 and 2022 came in at 55%. On February 9, Wells Fargo analyst Brian Fitzgerald noted that the Bard rollout has been disappointing. However, there is an opportunity for investment in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) due to the excitement around Generation Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI), which has potential for deployment without disrupting search monetization. Additionally, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a leader in conversational AI technology and there is a misunderstanding of what drives search share. As a result, the firm recommends purchasing Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares, assigning the stock an Overweight rating and a target price of $150.According to Insider Monkey’s Q4 data, 152 hedge funds were bullish on Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), compared to 156 funds in the prior quarter. Chris Hohn’s TCI Fund Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 54.5 million shares worth $4.8 billion. Diamond Hill Large Cap Strategy made the following comment about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Other bottom contributors included media and technology giant Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), apparel and footwear company V.F. Corporation and utility operator Dominion Energy. We believe Alphabet’s shares underperformed on concerns of a weakening macroeconomic environment. The company also reported weaker-than-expected earnings and revenue for Q3 2022. Longer-term, we expect Alphabet’s search engine advertising, YouTube advertising and other initiatives to continue driving revenue growth. As such, we used the share price weakness this quarter to add to our position.”6. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)3-year Revenue Growth: 61.7%NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a California-based provider of graphics, semiconductors, and networking solutions in the United States, Taiwan, China, and internationally.

Muse, an analyst at Evercore ISI, increased the price target on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) from $245 to $300 while maintaining an Outperform rating on the shares. This decision comes after NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) beat expectations for the January quarter and provided an even more positive outlook for the April quarter. The firm expects data center revenues to accelerate throughout the entirety of 2023, which should be positively received given concerns about decelerating data center demand and the potential for a total revenue guide down for April, the analyst wrote in a research note. According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 106 hedge funds were long NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), compared to 89 funds in the earlier quarter. Like Tesla, Inc.

Since our initial purchase in 2013, NVDA has seen its stock decline 50% one other time, back in 2018. The best-performing businesses and stocks do not go up and to the right. Mr. Market gets moody, and even one of the highest quality companies in the world is not immune. Drawdowns of this magnitude are challenging to stomach, even though the stock is up 50x in less than ten years. While we consider ourselves old school value investors, we continue to hold this fantastic company even though, optically, it does not appear cheap. Our confidence in Jensen remains, and while gaming is no longer in hyper-growth mode, the Data Center segment continues to grow. AI, Automotive, and other small but rapidly growing industries are the next leg of the story. Chris Mayer discusses the position in greater detail with commentary from our CIO, Peter O’Keefe.

It was the first trial of opioid claims brought by individual plaintiffs, rather than government entities.""We are pleased with the jury's decision, which confirms that a law meant to apply to street dealers of illegal drugs cannot be used in a misguided attack"" on distributors of federally licensed drugs, Cardinal said in a statement.McKesson called the verdict ""the right outcome based on the law and evidence.""A lawyer for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The 21 plaintiffs include children whose parents died of overdoses, a woman whose grandson was born with opioid addiction symptoms and died at one month old, and a woman who was raped as a teenager but received no help from her opioid-addicted mother.Plaintiffs said the distributors fueled illegal opioid use by filling illegitimate pharmacy orders and failing to report suspicious opioid purchases to law enforcement, as required by the federal Controlled Substances Act.Litigation by more than 3,300 state, local and tribal governments against opioid manufacturers, distributors and pharmacies has resulted in more than $50 billion in settlements.Unlike those lawsuits, which accused companies of creating a public nuisance by failing to stem the flow of illegal opioids, the Georgia plaintiffs brought their claims under the state's Drug Dealer Liability Act, which allows people injured by illegal drug use to sue dealers.More than half a million people died from overdoses in the United States in the period from 1999 to 2020, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency has said opioid overdoses surged further during the COVID-19 pandemic, increasing 38% in 2020 over the previous year and another 15% in 2021.

Hereditary Cancer testing volume registered strong growth in the fourth quarter. GeneSight, within Hereditary Cancer testing, had yet another strong performance with volume improvement. The company ended the reported quarter with no outstanding debt, which is encouraging.On the flip side, significant gross margin contraction and operating loss as a result of mounting cost pressure are concerning.

While the stock has lost 7.6% over the past four weeks, there is light at the end of the tunnel as it is now in oversold territory and Wall Street analysts expect the company to report better earnings than they predicted earlier.How to Determine if a Stock is OversoldWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.Why a Trend Reversal is Due for MCKThe heavy selling of MCK shares appears to be in the process of exhausting itself, as indicated by its RSI reading of 26.79. So, the trend for the stock could reverse soon for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.This technical indicator is not the only factor that calls for a potential rebound for the stock. There is a fundamental indicator as well. A strong agreement among sell-side analysts covering MCK in raising earnings estimates for the current year has led to an increase in the consensus EPS estimate by 4.6% over the last 30 days. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.Story continuesMoreover, MCK currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. This is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential turnaround in the near term.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is currently pegged at $553.8 million.Healthcare revenues are expected to lie within $340 million to $345 million, whereas non-healthcare revenues are likely to be within $210 million to $220 million for the quarter.Adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter is projected to be within 81-86 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at 92 cents.Our TakeMasimo exited the fourth quarter of 2022 with better-than-expected results. The robust uptick in the top line and its healthcare business is encouraging. The company recorded robust order shipments during the reported quarter, which is encouraging. The expansion of the company’s installed base is also impressive.Masimo has also been deriving benefits from its acquisition of Sound United, owner of iconic brands such as Bowers &amp; Wilkins, Denon and Marantz, raising our optimism. A strong product pipeline, which includes planned launches of Masimo’s next-generation earbuds with adaptive acoustic technology, the Freedom watch with the Android operating system and B1 sleep and fitness bands, are also promising. A slew of favorable studies on Masimo’s products and enhancement to its telehealth capabilities are also promising.On the flip side, the company continues to operate in an unstable macroeconomic environment, including supply-chain challenges and currency headwinds, which raises our apprehension. The contraction of both margins in the quarter does not bode well. Masimo faces fierce competition from MedTech bigwigs, which is another area of concern.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksMasimo currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Becton, Dickinson and Company BDX, popularly known as BD, McKesson Corporation MCK and Hologic, Inc.

According to the International Energy Agency, hydrogen garnered significant interest. In fact, it stated in 2019 that clean hydrogen “…is currently enjoying unprecedented political and business momentum, with the number of policies and projects around the world expanding rapidly.”Arguably, even the top hydrogen growth stocks to buy can’t live off narratives alone. Fortunately, the hard numbers bode very well for the underlying industry. According to Grand View Research, the global hydrogen generation market reached a valuation of $129.85 billion in 2021. Further, analysts project that the sector will expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.4% from 2022 to 2030.Here’s the kicker. At the culmination of the forecasted period, the hydrogen industry should command total revenue of $225.55 billion. Given recent geopolitical flashpoints, this assessment could be understated. Therefore, it’s well worth your time to consider hydrogen growth stocks to buy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNLLSFNel$1.55SHELShell$60.63APDAir Products &amp; Chemicals$280.98BEBloom Energy$21.32FCELFuelCell$3.21BLDPBallard Power$5.53PLUGPlug Power$14.18Nel (NLLSF)An image of hydrogen fuel silos standing against a blue skySource: Audio und werbung / ShutterstockHeadquartered in Oslo, Norway, Nel (OTCMKTS:NLLSF) is a global company providing solutions for the production, storage and distribution of hydrogen from renewable energy sources. Despite its seemingly risky nature – being traded in the over-the-counter market – NLLSF represents a solid performer. For example, in the trailing year, shares gained nearly 18% of equity value. For the new year, it’s up nearly 19%.To be fair, Nel will require tremendous investor patience, even among hydrogen growth stocks, which generally present a riskier profile. For instance, on a trailing-year basis, both its operating and net margins rank well below breakeven. Naturally, other associated metrics such as return on equity and return on asset swims in red ink as well.Story continuesOn the other hand, it’s not a purely speculative idea. In particular, it features a robust balance sheet. Its cash-to-debt ratio stands at 22.16, beating out 81.63% of its peers. Finally, covering analysts peg NLLSF as a consensus hold. Still, their average price target stands at $1.72, implying over 8% upside potential.Shell (SHEL)logo on a gas station in Iceland.Source: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.comA giant among global big oil firms, Shell (NYSE:SHEL) obviously made a name for itself in the hydrocarbon industry. However, the company’s also diving into the hydrogen ecosystem. Per its website, the company will build the Holland Hydrogen I, which will be Europe’s largest renewable hydrogen plant once operational in 2025. In the trailing year, SHEL gained nearly 17% of equity value.Despite its relevancies and solid market performance, Shell offers an objectively discounted investment. Currently, the market prices SHEL at a trailing multiple of 5.28. As a discount to earnings, Shell ranks better than 64.66% of the competition.Operationally, the company fires on all cylinders. Its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 9.2%, above nearly 70% of its peers. Further, its net margin is just above 11%, outpacing over 63% of rivals.Turning to Wall Street, covering analysts peg SHEL as a consensus moderate buy. In addition, their average price target stands at $65.76, implying over 9% upside potential. Thus, it makes for a reliable entry among hydrogen growth stocks to buy.Air Products &amp; Chemicals (APD)Air Products (APD) logo on the Arts Quest building, Air Products is a sponsor of Air Products Town Square at Arts Quest in Bethlehem, PASource: Andy Borysowski / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Allentown, Pennsylvania, Air Products &amp; Chemicals (NYSE:APD) has a principal business which involves selling gases and chemicals for industrial uses. Therefore, it represents a fundamentally reliable and presently relevant candidate for hydrogen growth stocks. Subtly confirming this point, APD gained nearly 19% of equity value in the trailing year.To be fair, APD did encounter a hiccup recently. Since the January opener, APD shed nearly 9% of market value. However, according to Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value (FMV), Air Products rates as modestly undervalued.Operationally, the company really comes alive. Presently, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 12.3%, outpacing 70.38% of sector rivals. On the bottom line, its net margin pings at 17.61%, blowing past 86.33% of the industry. In addition, its return on equity reached 16.55%, reflecting a high-quality business.Lastly, Wall Street analysts peg APD as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $330.91, implying over 18% upside potential.Bloom Energy (BE)BE stock Bloom Energy logo on a buildingSource: Sundry Photography / ShutterstockBased in San Jose, California, Bloom Energy (NYSE:BE) manufactures and markets solid oxide fuel cells that produce electricity on-site. According to its public profile, Bloom’s fuel cells are subsidized by government incentive programs for green energy. As of 2020, Bloom had installed about 600 megawatts worth of fuel cells. Over the trailing year, BE gained over 12% of equity value.Further generating investor excitement, BE moved up almost 17% since the Jan. opener. However, finding more justification for bidding up Bloom will require some patience and faith. Let’s be blunt: its financials could use a lot of work.Operationally, its three-year revenue growth rate went 1.8% below parity. It’s not unusual for the underling industry but obviously, it’s not a great development. Also, its profit margins rank well into the crimson depths. Plus, its Altman Z-Score (also in negative territory) reflects a distressed enterprise.Still, Wall Street believes it’s one of the hydrogen growth stocks to buy. Analysts peg BE as a consensus moderate buy with a price target implying over 30% upside potential.FuelCell Energy (FCEL)Hydrogen Stocks Man hold a fuel dispenser with hydrogen on gas station. h2 combustion engine for emission free eco friendly transport.

Further, its public profile states that the company’s technology is an alternative to traditional combustion-based power generation and is complementary to intermittent sources of energy, such as solar and wind turbines. Since the Jan. opener, FCEL gained over 27% of equity value.However, FCEL ranks among the riskiest hydrogen growth stocks to buy. For example, in the past 365 days, shares stumbled almost 36%. Financially, it’s not difficult to understand why. In particular, its three-year revenue growth rate sits over 32% below parity. Also, its net margin fell well into negative territory.If that wasn’t enough, Gurufocus.com warns that FuelCell represents a possible value trap. With that said, the company benefits from a reasonably robust balance sheet. For instance, its cash-to-debt ratio is 4.39, outpacing nearly 70% of its rivals.Presently, Wall Street analysts peg FCEL as a consensus hold. However, their average price target stands at $3.95, implying almost 17% upside potential.Ballard Power Systems (BLDP)a symbol with H2 (hydrogen) on it and a fill-up tankSource: Alexander Kirch / Shutterstock.comOne of the most popular speculative names among hydrogen growth stocks, Ballard Power Systems (NASDAQ:BLDP) is a developer and manufacturer of proton exchange membrane fuel cell products for markets such as heavy-duty motive, portable power, material handling as well as engineering services. Since the January opener, BLDP gained nearly 22% of equity value.However, that’s not the whole story. In the trailing year, shares hemorrhaged nearly 40%. Therefore, BLDP is only for those who want to swing for the fences – and can accept the consequences should that wager go awry. Chances are, it probably will.Gurufocus.com also warns that Ballard Power represents a possible value trap. At the moment, the company suffers from declining salles growth and negative margins. However, on the positive front, Ballard features a strong cash-rich balance sheet. As well, the market prices BLDP at 1.46-times book value, coming in lower than nearly 63% of its peers.As a clear warning, Wall Street analysts peg BLDP as a consensus moderate sell. However, its last individual buy rating (from B. Riley Financial’s Christopher Souther) forecasted a price target of $9, implying over 56% upside potential.Plug Power (PLUG)Hydrogen logo on gas stations fuel dispenser, symbolizing H2 combustion engine for emissions-free eco-friendly transport.Source: Alexander Kirch / Shutterstock.comFocusing on the development of hydrogen fuel cell systems, Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) consistently attracted speculative interest among those seeking viable hydrogen growth stocks to buy. Ultimately, the company aims to replace conventional batteries in equipment and vehicles powered by electricity. Since the Jan. opener, PLUG stock gained over 20% of equity value.Like some of the other hydrogen growth stocks, Plug Power will require significant patience. As a pure-play hydrogen idea, it may incur wild volatility. For instance, during the trailing year, shares tumbled 33%. Naturally, that’s not going to inspire confidence.And neither will the financial profile, with Plug Power suffering from deeply negative profit margins. On the top line, circumstances ring relatively much better. Its three-year revenue growth rate is 4.2%. However, it’s barely above the median performance for the industry.Despite significant challenges, covering analysts peg PLUG as a consensus strong buy. As well, their average price target stands at $29.42, implying nearly 101% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

(Jay L. Clendenin / Los Angeles Times)Standing at the podium at a fire station in Florida's Lake Buena Vista — home to Walt Disney World — Gov. Ron DeSantis this week declared victory in his ongoing fight against Disney. ""Today the corporate kingdom finally comes to an end,” he said.By ""corporate kingdom,"" DeSantis was referring to the sprawling theme park’s long-standing system of self-governance, an arrangement established more than 50 years ago that helped land the entertainment giant in Florida and make it the Sunshine State's largest private employer.Under legislation DeSantis signed Monday, the state of Florida took control of the Reedy Creek Improvement District, which essentially operated as Disney's private municipal government in the area containing Walt Disney World and other parks. The move is widely seen as retaliation against Disney after the company, facing internal pressure, criticized a Florida education law known by critics as ""Don't Say Gay"" because of its restrictions on classroom instruction on gender identity and sexual orientation in kindergarten through third grade.The district formerly known as Reedy Creek now has a new name and a board whose members are picked by DeSantis. Under the previous system, the Reedy Creek board was essentially selected by Disney.For DeSantis, who has been using the Burbank entertainment company as a foil on cultural issues, the move is a public relations coup among conservatives as politicos widely expect him to run for president in 2024. It came just as DeSantis was about to publish his book, ""The Courage to Be Free.""But what did Disney actually lose from its battle with DeSantis?Although the new law delivers some significant changes, the most crucial one is the canceling of a previous mandate that would have resulted in the total dissolution of the district. That earlier law, which DeSantis and state legislators rushed across the finish line in a sprint last spring, would have left taxpayers in Orange and Osceola counties, the two counties Disney straddles, saddled with debt owed by the district.Story continues“That was something that a lot of people were worried about,” said Jacob Schumer, an attorney specializing in Florida local government and tax laws who has written about the bond-debt issue. “Nothing is going to change. The disaster that was gonna hit the county and the taxpayers around here other than Disney — it’s not going to affect them.”Representatives of Disney and of DeSantis did not immediately answer requests for comment.But the law does change who controls the government overseeing Disney's kingdom in the state, which could be a harbinger of looming battles as tension mounts between the company, which has increasingly embraced progressive social issues, and the conservative state that has taken up leading a crusade against what it describes as “woke ideology.”The new roster of board members, whom DeSantis named Monday, includes Bridget Ziegler, a conservative education activist and co-founder of the right-wing group Moms for Liberty; Ron Peri, chairman of the Gathering USA, a Christian ministry; and three attorneys, including the president of the Federalist Society’s Orlando chapter.“He appointed cultural warriors, Christian national-types. That’s not an overstatement,” said Richard Foglesong, a political scientist and the author of “Married to the Mouse: Walt Disney World and Orlando.""In recent years, Disney has overhauled its products and amusement parks, drawing the ire of conservatives.Visitors to the Magic Kingdom’s fireworks show are now met with a gender-neutral greeting, a departure from previous welcomes addressing “ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls.” The company has also revamped older attractions criticized as insensitive, including the Jungle Cruise and Pirates of the Caribbean, and is transforming Splash Mountain into a new “Princess and the Frog”-themed ride after years of complaints about the racism prevalent in “Song of the South,” the 1946 film that inspired the ride.The appointees — whom Foglesong likened to appointees to airport authorities or a public works department — don't have say over Disney's products. But they could leverage their positions in Florida’s ongoing culture war clash with Disney in any future requests the company makes for roads, new projects or other ventures.“That’s a combustible mix, it seems to me, to have people who are censors who are working as supervisors for an arm of the Walt Disney company,” Foglesong said.The law also changed the special district’s name from the Reedy Creek Improvement District to the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District. In addition, the bill removed some other periphery privileges, such as prohibiting Disney from building a nuclear power plant or an airport at the resort, which the company was unlikely to ever use.“I think [Disney is] more threatened now than I imagined they would be,” Foglesong said, pointing to the slate of appointees. The New College of Florida in Sarasota, where DeSantis is embarking on a mission to overhaul the small, progressive school into a model of conservatism, is a cautionary tale, he added.But in other ways, it’s mostly business as usual, at least for now, experts say. Many essential privileges that made Reedy Creek unique remain intact, including the ability to issue bonds. “Those are the special things about what Reedy Creek did,” Schumer said.Reedy Creek was born in part from the lessons that brothers Walt and Roy Disney learned from operating Disneyland in Anaheim, which opened in 1955. Their ambitions were curtailed by government red tape, having to work with the city for public services and on zoning issues.As the brothers looked to expand Disney’s footprint — only 10% of the people who came to Disneyland in California came from east of the Mississippi River — they wanted to have their own self-regulating system. The company eventually settled on Florida and worked with lawmakers to establish the Reedy Creek Improvement District in 1967. The theme park opened a few years later in 1971.The district, spanning about 40 square miles in Orange and Osceola counties, provides everything from fire protection and emergency medical services to water systems, flood control and electric power generation. Its boundaries include four theme parks, two water parks, a sports complex, 175 miles of roadway, the cities of Bay Lake and Lake Buena Vista, utility centers, more than 40,000 hotel rooms and hundreds of restaurants and retail stores, according to its website.What's ahead for Disney remains to be seen. DeSantis has called upon the board to propose additional changes in authorities and exemptions in a year and again in five years, Foglesong noted.“Maybe down the road, [DeSantis] will be able to take another bite of the apple and take away powers and exemptions that the Disney company still has,” Foglesong said.Times staff writer Ryan Faughnder and the Associated Press contributed to this report.

""There's a new sheriff in town, and accountability will be the order of the day.""DeSantis, who rebranded the district previously known as Reedy Creek to the ""Central Florida Tourism Oversight District,"" hand-selected the five board members who will now oversee Disney's municipal services. Previous board members were selected by Reedy Creek, which was fully controlled by Disney.""The good question now is what will be the impact of the new board that he appointed,"" Richard Foglesong, Disney historian and author of the book ""Married to the Mouse: Walt Disney World and Orlando,"" told Yahoo Finance Live in an interview on Tuesday.""We have a five-member board of supervisors that consists principally of cultural warrior types, Christian nationalist types. ...I think there is an issue here,"" he warned.Disney's new oversight boardDeSantis' board includes Bridget Ziegler, a conservative member of the Sarasota County School Board and co-founder of Moms for Liberty; Martin Garcia, an attorney who runs investment firm Pinehill Capital Partners, which donated $50,000 to a DeSantis-aligned political committee; and Ron Perri, chairman and CEO of The Gathering USA, a ministry ""of evangelism, discipleship and mission opportunities for men.""""The Disney company is the major manufacturer of culture in the United States,"" Foglesong said. ""When you have people appointed to a board who can appropriately, fairly by their own description, be called cultural warriors and Christian nationalists. ...I think that's a combustible mix.""Foglesong noted there should not be much change to Disney's day-to-day operations given a full dissolution did not occur: ""[Disney] had special powers, and it still has those powers.""Story continuesPeople gather at the Magic Kingdom theme park before the ""Festival of Fantasy"" parade at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, U.S. July 30, 2022. REUTERS/Octavio JonesDeSantis previously suggested he would fully strip Disney of its special tax privileges, throwing the district's $997 million worth of bond debt and some $163 million in annual tax payments into question — a sizable fear among local taxpayers.However, DeSantis stressed Disney is still responsible for its municipal debts and that local governments would not raise taxes.Disney did not respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment, although the company told other outlets last month it would not fight the governor's takeover.Why it matters and how we got hereThe 40-square mile area, known for years as the Reedy Creek Improvement District, allowed Disney to operate as a self-governing entity since its inception.Disney, in addition to paying property taxes to Orange and Osceola counties, paid taxes directly to Reedy Creek. In turn, the district used that money to fund Disney's various theme park projects and operations, including infrastructure upkeep.That means Disney controlled all of its utilities and infrastructure, set building codes, operated its own emergency services and fire departments, and could expand and grow whenever it wished — all without local or state government interference, until now.In addition to the newly named board, the bill will end some of Disney's other privileges, such as its exemption from adhering to Florida building codes, along with its exclusion from state regulatory reviews and approvals.Republican Florida Governor Ron DeSantis speaks during his 2022 U.S. midterm elections night party in Tampa, Florida, U.S., November 8, 2022. REUTERS/Marco BelloThe battle over Disney's special privileges began in April of last year — largely seen as a politically-targeted response over the company's reaction to the so-called ""Don't Say Gay"" bill.The bill states: “Classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.”At the time, then-CEO Bob Chapek, who initially decided not to speak publicly on the matter, opted to work behind the scenes in a failed attempt to soften the legislation.The executive eventually reversed course following intense backlash, publicly denouncing the act during the company's annual shareholder meeting on March 9, 2022, in addition to directly apologizing to employees in a company memo.Chapek's mishandling of the situation has been categorized as one of the many catalysts for his ousting, as Bob Iger returned to the CEO chair in November.Alexandra is a Senior Entertainment and Media Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Using new Skydio Drone Dock technology, ComEd crews will test remote drone monitoring solutions that will enable safe, cost-effective on-site and on-demand surveillance capabilities without dispatching trucks of crews to perform in-person inspections.""At ComEd we are always looking for ways to improve our customers’ experience and advance our storm recovery efforts. Smarter equipment monitoring is one way to proactively prevent outages and support overall grid performance,"" said Terence Donnelly, president and COO of ComEd. ""The expansion of our drone program builds upon the innovative work we have done over the last decade to strengthen and modernize our system.""The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which regulates commercial drone operation, permits organizations like ComEd to request operational waivers that allow pilots to remotely operate drones without a visual line of sight. These operational waivers will allow FAA-certified ComEd pilots to use enhanced drones to support routine equipment inspection, enabling utility crews to focus on priority grid repair and improvements.Remote monitoring by drone will support overall grid performance by increasing ComEd’s ability to rapidly inspect equipment throughout the electric company’s service territory. This will help reduce operations and maintenance costs, while helping identify potential problem areas and prevent power outages before they occur. Remote, off-site flying capabilities will also maximize ComEd’s drone pilots’ efforts by limiting the time they are physically needed in the field.To support ComEd’s nation-leading resiliency, routine monitoring of equipment is crucial to ensuring all grid assets are operating as intended. ComEd uses drones in a variety of ways, including to inspect power lines and following storms to assess damage and enable crews to more quickly and efficiently restore power. Drone pilots regularly join frontline workers in the field to assist with line and equipment inspection. In 2022, ComEd also began using drones to support vegetation management.Story continuesThe drones included in ComEd’s Drone Dock program will be equipped with a high-resolution camera and thermography tools. These features will allow the drones to capture extensive data, digital images and video from all angles of grid equipment, which will then be reviewed to help preemptively address future equipment failure based on equipment conditions and environmental factors.The docking station, manufactured by Skydio, provides a remote housing unit and launch pad for the drones when not in use. Currently, the technology is installed at ComEd’s Chicago Training Center while ComEd pilots are trained to use the new technology; the installation of additional docks is expected later in 2023 at secure locations throughout ComEd’s service territory.Commonwealth Edison Company (ComEd) is a unit of Chicago-based Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ: EXC), the nation’s leading competitive energy provider, with approximately 10 million customers. ComEd provides service to approximately 4 million customers across northern Illinois, or 70 percent of the state’s population.

Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings. . With that, I'll turn the call over to Pierce Norton, President and Chief Executive Officer. Pearce?Pierce Norton: Thanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning. On today's call is Walter Hulse, our Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Development, and Kevin Burdick, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer. Also available to answer your questions are Sheridan Swords, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids and Natural Gas Gathering and Processing, and Chuck Kelley, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Pipelines. Yesterday, we announced strong fourth quarter and full year '22 performance. We met our 2022 financial guidance expectations despite weather-related events and a significant operational incident. We also achieved our ninth consecutive year of adjusted EBITDA growth in 2022.Through the efforts of our workforce and the resiliency of our assets, we have provided exceptional value for our stakeholders and have positioned ONEOK to continue delivering growth in 2023. I believe the term resiliency is a great description descriptor of 2022 and will continue to be a focus of our operations going forward. Our people, assets and earnings continue to prove their resiliency flexibility and stability. With yesterday's earnings announcement, we also provided 2023 financial and volume guidance expectations. Higher natural gas processing and NGL volumes and strong fee-based earnings are expected to contribute to higher earnings in 2023 as we continue to focus on both growing our core business and innovating for future opportunities.Story continuesThere are key differentiators of ONEOK's business that have proven critical to our past success and offer us confidence in the future. These differentiators provide stability, resiliency and unique opportunities for growth. First, our solid and growing base business, which features strategically positioned assets in some of the most productive U.S. shale basins connected with some of the largest and most well-capitalized producers in the U.S. who provide stable and growing supply to our systems. Our margins in our core businesses are approximately 90% fee-based with minimum direct commodity price exposure because of our proactive hedging strategy; second, our strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit ratings, which provides significant financial flexibility.We've reduced our leverage to below 3.5x and significant -- a significant milestone for us. We provided investors with more than 25 years of dividend stability and growth not cutting our dividend during the COVID challenge years and recently announced a dividend increase. Third, our proven track record of intentional and disciplined growth. We continue to benefit from significant operating leverage across our systems, enabling us to continue focusing on lower capital, high-return projects and investments to support producer growth across our operations. Our strong return on invested capital is a source of pride for ONEOK and is a key metric for evaluating our management's team performance annually. Our nearly 15% ROIC in 2022 highlights the scrutiny that we place on investments, the efficiency of our capital and the high quality of our projects earnings, and this disciplined growth also approaches and will continue.Finally, the continued demand of the energy products and services that we provide, which are vital to our national security and the quality of life, in which we believe will play an important role in a transforming energy future. U.S. natural gas and natural gas liquids remain abundant and reliable. The products that we move will continue to provide much needed energy domestically and globally. We enter 2023 from a position of strength driven by a year of solid financial and operational performance. And as you can see, there are many reasons why we are confident and optimistic about ONEOK's future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Walt for a discussion of our financial performance.Walter Hulse: Thank you, Pierce. As we detailed in yesterday's press release, we expect continued growth in our businesses in 2023 after achieving our 2022 financial guidance even with some challenging events. ONEOK's fourth quarter and full year 2022 net income totaled $485 million and $1.72 billion, respectively, representing increases of 28% for the fourth quarter and 15% for the full year compared with the same period in 2021. Adjusted EBITDA also increased year-over-year, totaling $967 million in the fourth quarter 2022 and $3.62 billion for the full year. Our strong financial performance was driven by increased producer activity, higher realized commodity prices, higher average fee rates and higher natural gas storage and transportation services.In January, we increased our quarterly dividend to $0.95 per share or $3.82 per share on an annualized basis, marking a return to dividend growth following 3 years of dividend stability. In November 2022, we completed a $750 million senior notes offering due in 2032, generating net proceeds of $742 million, which was primarily used to repay short-term debt. And just yesterday, we redeemed $425 million of 5% senior notes due September 23 with cash on hand. Our year-end net debt-to-EBITDA on an annualized run rate basis was 3.46x, in line with our previously discussed aspirational target of 3.5x or less. As it relates to Medford, we reached an agreement with our insurers in early January to settle all claims related to the incident for total insurance payments of $930 million, which included $100 million that was paid in 2022.We received the remaining $830 million in the first quarter of 2023, and applied approximately $50 million to an outstanding 2022 insurance receivable. We provided a table in our earnings release showing the line-by-line details. The remaining $780 million will be recorded as a gain in our operating income in the first quarter of 2023. As Pierce mentioned, with yesterday's earnings announcement, we provided 2023 financial guidance, including a net income midpoint of $2.41 billion and an EPS midpoint of $5.36 per share diluted share. We also provided and adjusted EBITDA midpoint of $4.575 billion. Our guidance includes the net effect of the onetime insurance settlement gain of $780 million and future method related costs, primarily third-party fractionation, which we estimate will total $240 million in 2023.We expect Medford related costs to be significantly lower in 2024 due to our ability to fully utilize the MB-5 fractionator to substantially reduce third-party fractionation costs compared with 2023. By taking the full settlement of $780 million, less the $240 million of expected third-party costs in 2023, you get a total approximately $540 million related to the settlement that has been assumed in our $4.575 billion adjusted EBITDA guidance midpoint for 2023. Excluding the effect of the settlement and the third-party costs of $540 million, this still amounts to more than $4 billion, double-digit earnings growth which we referenced on our last earnings call. We also expect double-digit earnings growth at the midpoint for both natural gas liquids and natural gas gathering and processing segments driven by higher volume expectations across our operations.Oil and gas, Industry, EnergyPhoto by Ronan Furuta on UnsplashKevin will provide more detail on each of the operating segments in a moment. Our 2023 guidance assumes producer activity associated with WTI crude oil prices in the range of what we are currently seeing in the market. We expect total capital expenditures of $1.38 billion, which includes growth in maintenance capital. This midpoint reflects the investments necessary to keep up with expected increase in producer activity, the completion of MD5 early in the second quarter of 2023 and also more than $300 million related to MD6 this year. Excluding the MD6 expenditures, our total CapEx would have been lower than 2022. Our 2023 CapEx guidance does not include the Saro Connector pipeline or any other projects that have not reached a final investment decision.Our routine growth capital accounts for higher number of well connects and our higher return projects such as natural gas storage expansions, pump stations and compression expansions to meet customer needs. Finally, as it relates to the 15% alternative minimum tax associated with the inflation Reduction Act, we expect the AMT to have an impact on our cash taxes beginning with the 2024 tax year. You can find details in our 10 -K when it is filed later today. I will now turn the call over to Kevin for a commercial update.Kevin Burdick: Thank you, Walt. We saw strong full year natural gas gathering and NGL volumes on our system in 2022 despite several weather events during the year, providing continued growth in our primarily fee-based earnings. NGL volumes were particularly strong in the Rocky Mountain region, increasing 12% year-over-year due to higher activity levels and increased opportunities to recover ethane from the region. Well connects across our operations increased 24% compared with 2021, and we saw a solid return of activity in the Mid-Continent driving a significant increase in well connections in the region and higher natural gas processing volumes on our system. We'll continue to see the benefits of this activity throughout 2023 as volumes ramp.Our Natural Gas Pipelines segment exceeded its 2022 financial guidance range on higher earnings from long-term storage services and higher rates from renegotiated contracts customers continue to see the value in our storage assets, and we continue to evaluate opportunities to expand these services. Turning to 2023. A Key drivers for our higher 2023 guidance includes stable producer activity, providing higher natural gas and NGL volumes across our systems, continued strength in fee-based earnings and rates and higher expected realized commodity prices due to hedges placed at higher price levels compared with 2022. At the midpoints, our 2023 volume guidance would result in a 7% increase in total NGL volumes and an 11% increase in total natural gas processing volumes compared with 2022.In the natural gas liquids segment, we expect volume growth to be driven by strong producer levels, a producer activity across our operations, a continuing the momentum we saw from producers in 2022. Higher average fee rates will also contribute to the segment's earnings as contract escalators continue to be realized throughout the year. NGL market dynamics point toward a continued improvement in global demand with China reopening and with lower natural gas prices, resulting in an attractive environment for U.S. pet chems. We expect this current market to drive increased activity from the U.S. petrochemical industry relative to global pet chems while the U.S. position being with the U.S. position being one of the lowest on the global cost curve.On our system, we expect the Permian Basin to stay in high ethane recovery in 2023 and for the Mid-Continent to be in partial recovery as natural gas prices fluctuate seasonally. We also expect to continue to see opportunities to incentivize ethane recovery in the Rocky Mountain region this year. We are on track to complete our 125,000 barrel per day MB-5 fractionator in Mont Belvieu early in the second quarter of 2023. And we recently announced MB-6 which we expect to be complete in the first quarter of 2025. Moving on to the natural gas gathering and processing segment. We expect volume growth again this year in both the Rocky Mountain and Mid-Continent regions, driven by producer activity levels, resulting in more well connections than in 2022.In the Rocky Mountain region, we expect processed volumes to grow 11% at the midpoint compared with 2022 and averaged nearly 1.5 billion cubic feet per day in 2023. Already this year, despite winter weather, we've reached a process volumes as high as 1.46 billion cubic feet per day in February, a new record for the segment. We completed construction on the 200 million cubic feet per day Demicks Lake III processing plant this month, providing our customers with needed capacity as well as operational redundancy. Activity levels in the Williston Basin remains strong, particularly considering we are just entering March. There are currently more than 40 rigs and 22 completion crews operating in the basin compared with just over 30 rigs and 13 completion crews at this time last year.Producers remain committed to the region, and we anticipate a few more rigs will return as we move into spring. At our guidance midpoint, we expect to connect 500 wells in the region this year a nearly 40% increase compared with 2022. We've already connected nearly 90 wells through February and have remained steady at more than 20 rigs operating on our dedicated acreage. Additionally, there remains a large inventory of around 500 DUCs basin-wide with approximately half on our acreage. Keep in mind that in the Bakken, producer economics are driven by crude oil and customers -- our customers are some of the largest and most well capitalized in the country. This means recent fluctuations in commodity prices and specifically lower natural gas prices have not had an impact on producer activity levels on our acreage.We also expect gas-to-oil ratios to remain strong and continue to trend higher in the future, which can drive volume on our systems even without increased producer activity. In the Mid-Continent region, we continue to see positive activity with approximately 10 rigs currently operating on our acreage and more than 50 across the region. We expect process volumes to grow 12% at our guidance midpoint compared with 2022 and average more than 700 million cubic feet per day in 2023. Rig activity across the basin will also continue to drive additional NGLs to our system. In the natural gas pipeline segment, we continue to expect strong demand for natural gas storage and transportation services in 2023. At the end of 2022, nearly 80% of our natural gas storage capacity was contracted under long-term agreements, and our pipeline transportation capacity was nearly 95% contracted.We expect similar levels in 2023. Work continues on a project that will expand our storage capabilities in Oklahoma by 4 billion cubic feet and we are currently evaluating reactivating previously idled storage facilities in Oklahoma and Texas. Construction also continues on our Viking pipeline compression electrification project. The Oklahoma storage expansion and Viking project are both slated for completion this year. Additionally, in late December 2022, a ONEOK subsidiary filed a presidential permit application with the FERC to construct and operate new international border crossing facilities at the U.S. and Mexico border. The proposed border facilities would connect upstream with a potential ONEOK intrastate natural gas pipeline called the Swaro Connector pipeline and with a new pipeline under development in Mexico for ultimate delivery to an export facility on the West Coast of Mexico.Since the announcement, there have been several positive developments related to the potential LNG export project. And a final investment decision on the ONEOK pipeline is expected in mid-2023. Pearce, that concludes my remarks.Pierce Norton: Thank you, Kevin, and thank you, Walt. We covered a lot today, and we have many reasons to feel confident in our 2023 guidance and our expectations for more growth this year. Everything that we've talked about today, from our 2022 performance to our future expectations and key differentiators for growth are all underscored by our commitment and focus on safety and environmental performance. Our company and our industry aren't immune to incidents, but I'm proud of how we have responded when challenges do occur and how we continue working to improve our performance going forward, focusing on safety and the health of our employees and the communities near where we operate. From our environmental perspective, we've made significant progress toward our greenhouse gas emissions reduction target, achieving reductions that equate to approximately 20% of our total 2030 reduction target.Our employees' dedication to meeting customers' needs while operating our assets in a safe, reliable and environmentally responsible manner continues to drive our strong operational growth and financial performance year after year, and we're set up well for continued growth in 2023.

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Canadian Solar (CSIQ) earns a Zacks Rank #2 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.98 a share, just 20 days from its upcoming earnings release on March 21, 2023.CSIQ has an Earnings ESP figure of 102.76%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.98 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.48.CSIQ is part of a big group of Oils-Energy stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Oneok Inc. (OKE) as well.Oneok Inc. which is readying to report earnings on May 2, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $2.34 a share, and OKE is 62 days out from its next earnings report.Story continuesOneok Inc.'s Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 51.21% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.55.Because both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, CSIQ and OKE could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Shares have lost about 13.1% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Helmerich &amp; Payne due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Helmerich &amp; Payne Q1 Earnings Beat EstimatesHelmerich &amp; Payne reported fiscal first-quarter 2023 adjusted net income of $1.11 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 81 cents per share. In the year-ago period, the company had incurred a loss of 45 cents per share. The outperformance reflects a significant uptick in activity.Meanwhile, operating revenues of $719.6 million topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $689 million and increased 75.6% from the year-ago level on the back of strong results from the North America Solutions segment. Precisely, sales from the unit totaled $ 627.12 million, well ahead of the consensus mark of $623 million.In good news for investors, Helmerich &amp; Payne is using the excess cash from a supportive environment to reward investors with dividends and buybacks. As part of this, HP’s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 25 cents per share to its common shareholders of record on Feb 14. The payout will be made on Feb 28. In addition to the regular dividend, HP declared a supplemental dividend of 23.5 cents per share.The company also expanded its share repurchase program to include 5 million shares in calendar year 2023, up from 4 million before.Segmental PerformanceNorth America Solutions: During the quarter, operating revenues of $627.2 million were up 83.9% year over year on higher activity levels, with the average number of active rigs rising from 183 to 188. The steep uptick in drilling works on the back of robust oil and gas prices, together with pricing improvements, meant that the segment turned around from the previous year’s operating loss of $28.9 million to a profit of $145.3 million.Offshore Gulf of Mexico: Revenues of $35.2 million increased 20% from the year-ago quarter as activity remained robust. Moreover, margins during the October-December period of 2022 expanded more than 10% year over year, resulting in the segment’s profit improving 23.4% (from the prior-year period) to $6.7 million.International Solutions: In contrast to the prior quarter's operating loss of $0.8 million, this segment saw operating profitability of $1.6 million. In the absence of an $8.1 million impairment charge in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the increase in operating income was driven by an increase in revenue days and lower expenses, primarily associated with delayed rig mobilizations.Story continuesFinancial PositionIn the reported quarter, Helmerich &amp; Payne spent $96 million on capital programs. As of Dec 31, 2022, the company had $229.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, while long-term debt was $542.9 million (debt-to-capitalization of 16.1).GuidanceThis Tulsa, OK-based company anticipates direct margin in the North America Solutions segment between $280 million and $300 million in the fiscal second quarter. It expects around 183-188 contracted rigs by Mar 31, 2023.Coming to the Offshore Gulf of Mexico segment, Helmerich &amp; Payne envisions direct margin within $8-$10 million for the fiscal second-quarter.Additionally, International Solutions’ direct margin is forecast to be between $7 and $10 million for the second quarter.For the fiscal year, Helmerich &amp; Payne still estimates capital outlay within $425-$475 million, while it hopes to shell out some $400 million as depreciation and $195 million in the form of general and administrative expenses.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates review.VGM ScoresCurrently, Helmerich &amp; Payne has a strong Growth Score of A, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the top 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Helmerich &amp; Payne has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Juniper Networks and Motorola are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that JNPR is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.JNPR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 13.63, while MSI has a forward P/E of 23.58. We also note that JNPR has a PEG ratio of 1.96. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. MSI currently has a PEG ratio of 2.62.Another notable valuation metric for JNPR is its P/B ratio of 2.23. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, MSI has a P/B of 335.44.Story continuesBased on these metrics and many more, JNPR holds a Value grade of B, while MSI has a Value grade of C.JNPR sticks out from MSI in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that JNPR is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Many well-known institutions have used Intel's SDK and provided favorable reviews.  It is hailed as a paradigm shift in quantum development since it is incredibly easy to use and enables the developer to operate closer to the hardware for optimized resource utilization.Intel, the world’s largest semiconductor company and primary supplier of microprocessors and chipsets, is gradually reducing its dependence on the PC-centric business by moving into data-centric businesses — such as AI and autonomous driving. It is gaining rapid strides in the data center business with integrated solutions that are highly competitive in prices. The company is also focusing on developing a complete product range targeting different segments of the market. Healthy traction from Mobileye’s technologies related to cameras, in-car networking, sensor chips, roadway mapping, cloud software, machine learning and data management are tailwinds.The drive to lower-cost computing devices is increasing the pressure on servers taking the load off these devices. As more information in various structures and formats are increasingly stored in the cloud, there is demand for a new breed of chips that are more efficient in terms of cost and energy but may not pack in quite as much compute power as in the past. Intel has made advancements in this area and it is now offering more integrated solutions that will likely be competitive on a cost-per-watt basis.

Comcast provided an $85,000 investment and state-of-the-art technology makeover for the space to take full advantage of the free internet connectivity already offered by the company through its Lift Zone program. The technology equipment installed in the Enhanced Lift Zone includes a 3D printer, 20 computers, webcams, TV displays to support group video lessons and more.Comcast also announced an additional $25,000 donation to Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Snohomish County for additional programing at the Grand Opening Ceremony.The contribution is part of a long partnership between the two organizations and will provide immersive tech and STEM-related activities for kids in Snohomish County. Lynnwood Mayor Christine Frizzell and Snohomish County Council Legislative Aide Josh Thompson joined the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Snohomish County, Comcast, and more than 50 local families at the unveiling ceremony yesterday at the Alderwood Boys &amp; Girls Club.According to a K12 Report Card from the Washington Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI), fewer students in Washington state schools have met English, Math, and Science standards since the pandemic. Further complicating this trend is that 20 percent of fourth-grade and 10 percent of eighth-grade students in Washington do not have access to the internet and a computer at home, according to a study from the National Center for Education Statistics.""Lack of internet access in the home limits access to education, and our new Enhanced Lift Zone from Comcast can play a critical role in supporting kids to help them with their schoolwork and activities in reading, writing, math, and science,"" said Marci Volmer, COO – The Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Snohomish County.

Comcast also plays an important role in connecting people to the internet outside the home, and our Lift Zones and Enhanced Lift Zones seek to address that need.""This effort is part of Project UP, Comcast's $1 billion commitment to reach tens of millions of people over the next 10 years with the tools, resources, and skills needed to succeed in a digital world. Project UP is Comcast's company-wide initiative to advance digital equity, which includes Internet Essentials, the nation's largest and most comprehensive broadband adoption program.Since 2011, Internet Essentials has connected more than 140,000 households in Washington, including nearly 14,000 households in Snohomish County, to high-speed internet at home, many for the first time. Internet Essentials' comprehensive design addresses three significant barriers to broadband adoption, including access to free digital literacy training in print, online, and in-person; the option to purchase a heavily subsidized, low-cost internet-ready computer; and low-cost, high-speed internet service for $9.95 a month, plus tax.For more information about Internet Essentials and Comcast’s commitment to education and digital equity, please visit https://corporate.comcast.com/education.

Vivo uses technology to fulfill its mission of bringing people closer together and moving to the cloud is a key tenant of this objective. In 2021, to help with the company's goals of reducing IT costs and accelerating product releases, Vivo decided to migrate all of the data and processes for product testing and development hosted in its data center in Campinas, São Paulo to the cloud. Vivo conducted a thorough analysis and chose OCI as the best cloud provider due to its ability to help meet customer demand and reduce IT costs without operational risks.""Moving to the cloud provides us with the agility we need to accelerate our business and helps improve our services to respond to market and customer needs faster than was previously possible,"" said Denise Inaba, CIO, Vivo.Currently more than 90 percent of the data from the Campinas data center has been transferred to OCI to support Vivo's mission-critical applications. A key part of Vivo's decision to select OCI was its compatibility with VMware through the Oracle Cloud VMware Solution (OCVS), which simplifies IT infrastructure by running telco applications in virtualized environments. This interoperability allows the Vivo IT team to maintain complete control over the OCI environment and the virtual machines (VMs) it hosts using VMware. Most of Vivo's technology environment is virtualized, with more than a quarter of its VMs running on OCI.Story continuesDecommissioning the datacenter will reduce Vivo's operational expenses by approximately 18 to 25 percent due to the elimination of physical assets, such as equipment and real estate. Besides cost reduction, this migration will allow Vivo to speed up the availability of innovative service offerings for its 112 million customers by 30 percent or more.  Additionally, Vivo will be able to improve its environmental impact because the workloads hosted in OCI's public cloud are run out of the Oracle Cloud São Paulo Region, which is powered by 100 percent renewable energy. As a result, Oracle and Vivo are demonstrating a commitment to helping the environment by helping to reduce Vivo's carbon footprint.""The telecommunications industry is incredibly competitive and to be successful organizations need every operational advantage they can find. By moving its operations to the cloud, Vivo is showing a forward thinking strategy that will help it meet the demands and expectations of its customers faster and more efficiently,"" said Moises Medeiros, vice president, Communications and Media, Oracle Brazil. ""With our local cloud regions in Brazil, we are giving Vivo the support it needs to innovate quickly by helping ensure it has the computing resources needed for product development close at hand while still benefiting from using a public cloud.""Vivo selected Oracle in May 2021.Additional Resources Learn more about Oracle Cloud InfrastructureLearn more about Oracle Cloud VMware SolutionLearn more about Oracle Cloud for TelcosAbout OCI's Distributed CloudOCI's distributed cloud offers customers the benefits of cloud with greater control over data residency, locality, and authority, even across multiple clouds.

(NYSE:FIS) Trading At A 23% Discount?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fidelity-national-information-services-inc-120312812.html,1677758592,STORY,['FIS'],"[Key InsightsUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Fidelity National Information Services fair value estimate is US$82.02Current share price of US$62.85 suggests Fidelity National Information Services is potentially 23% undervaluedOur fair value estimate is 1.9% lower than Fidelity National Information Services' analyst price target of US$80.46How far off is Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Fidelity National Information Services What's The Estimated Valuation?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.06bUS$4.20bUS$3.91bUS$3.99bUS$4.08bUS$4.16bUS$4.25bUS$4.33bUS$4.42bUS$4.51bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x8Analyst x4Analyst x1Est @ 2.06%Est @ 2.06%Est @ 2.06%Est @ 2.07%Est @ 2.07%Est @ 2.07% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.8% US$2.8kUS$3.5kUS$3.0kUS$2.8kUS$2.6kUS$2.4kUS$2.2kUS$2.1kUS$1.9kUS$1.8k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$25bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 9.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.5b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (9.8%– 2.1%) = US$60bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$60b÷ ( 1 + 9.8%)10= US$24bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$49b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$62.9, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 23% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Fidelity National Information Services as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.293. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Fidelity National Information ServicesStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the IT market.OpportunityExpected to breakeven next year.Has sufficient cash runway for more than 3 years based on current free cash flows.Good value based on P/S ratio and estimated fair value.Significant insider buying over the past 3 months.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Paying a dividend but company is unprofitable.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Fidelity National Information Services, we've put together three relevant elements you should explore:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

Easterbrook agreed in 2021 to pay the company $105 million to settle claims that he misled the board about his relations with employees. He apologized to his former co-workers and the board.Investors argued directors could have saved millions of dollars if they had conducted a thorough investigation of Easterbrook at the time he was fired, but that the directors refused to do so because they did not want to expose their own allegedly careless oversight.Laster said regardless of whether the directors could have handled the Easterbrook investigation better, they were protected if they acted in good faith.""The record shows that the Board actively enforced the Company’s policies and commitment to maintaining safe, respectful, and inclusive workplaces,"" the company said in a statement.A lawyer for the plaintiffs did not respond to a request for comment.Laster also said the directors could not be sued for ignoring a wave of sexual misconduct allegations, including lawsuits by employees, complaints to regulators and allegations that David Fairhurst, the top human resources executive, committed sexual harassment.Rather than ignore the problem, the directors updated corporate policy, implemented training and brought in consultants, Laster said.While the judge ruled in January that shareholders can pursue a case against Fairhurst for allegedly allowing a culture of misconduct to flourish at the company, that case was also dismissed on Wednesday.

I think the ingredients have changed a little, the sauce has become tastier.""Vkusno &amp; tochka CEO Oleg Paroev said, when announcing the new product in December, that the sauce and layout of ingredients would change.But his company's strategy has also been to focus on continuity, with advertising slogans such as ""The same double cheeseburger"" and the chain's new logo - a stylised burger with two fries - resembling the letter 'M'.Not everyone was sold on the new burger.""The sauce, which was the Big Mac's main quality, has become a little more sweet and sour,"" said Vladimir, a student.""And the bun has basically got worse.

A key part of this is acknowledging the differences between equity and equality; fostering allyship; and leaning into programs, resources, and policies that support female associates and their professional development.At T. Rowe Price, we are committed and intentional in our approach to attract, develop, and retain women and foster an inclusive culture for all. Our diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts include increasing female representation, instilling leadership accountability in building and growing diverse teams, and providing inclusive experiences for our associates and clients. A few of our associates shared what it means to #EmbraceEquity, this year's theme for International Women's Day:Gaby Infante, Director, Corporate ESG and WAVE @ T. Rowe Price ChairInternational Women's Day commemorates women's achievements and raises awareness of persisting societal challenges. It's also an important call to action. Gender inequality remains the norm around the world-despite some progress on closing gender gaps in work and education. This is the celebration of all the differences that make us be seen, appreciated, and included. Being included feels good. Belonging somewhere feels good and brings out the best in us. As a long-term solution for addressing imbalances in social systems, equity is the path we must walk together to reach equality. Embracing equity is the right thing to do.Watikqua Lange, Diversity Partner and Women in Investments Program LeadEmbracing equity is layered. To me, it means you understand that, in life, different groups have a different starting point. As a result, each group needs tailored and nuanced support that acknowledges that different starting point. And the tailored and nuanced support will and should look different because there isn't a ""one size fits all."" But more importantly, embracing equity means championing these nuanced solutions even if you are not the direct beneficiary.Story continuesVinnett Mason, Head of High-Net-Worth Investors and Amplify Voices ChairTo embrace equity means to acknowledge there isn't always a level playing field. We have different backgrounds and experiences that must be taken into consideration when determining the unique resources and support each of us needs to succeed. One size does not fit all. Equity addresses the systemic and societal systems that create obstacles that make it more difficult for some to succeed. As a leader and chair of Amplify Voices, an advisory committee that supports the firm's ongoing efforts to attract, develop, advance, and retain underrepresented female talent, it is my role to meet associates where they are, educate others to increase awareness of the disparities, and address the imbalance to level the playing field. Equality is the goal-how we get there is through equity.Sarah Teves, APAC Diversity PartnerAt work, embracing equity is the path to an equal world. Diversity and inclusion will not work without guaranteeing fair treatment, access, and opportunity for all. We need to do this collectively in the workplace and examine systems, processes, and norms that may prevent the full participation of everyone. As a parent, embracing equity means showing up as a conscious and present parent. It is a lot of observing and truly listening to my children to see their uniqueness and needs and providing them with the opportunities and support they need to thrive. It also means modeling how I confront bias, stereotypes, and discrimination.Sabrina Thornton, Creativity and Innovation Program Officer, T. Rowe Price FoundationEmbracing equity means embracing individuality. Each individual is unique in their ideas, abilities, and demeanor-and I think we can accomplish great things when we welcome diversity of thought. Throughout my career, I've had the joy of working with, and learning from, people from all backgrounds and walks of life. And while we honored each other's individuality, we always found some significant commonalities as well.Ritu Vohora, Vice President, Investment Specialist - Global Capital Markets and Cochair of MOSAIC @ T. Rowe Price's EMEA ChapterEmbracing equity is acknowledging that each person has their own unique story. It's consciously looking at ways to break down barriers, both structural and systemic, to create a fairer playing field and proactively support individual needs so they can flourish. It's creating a culture where people are comfortable being their true authentic selves, are included, have a sense of belonging, and do not feel they have to constantly go above and beyond to prove themselves to command attention and respect. Respect is the basis of inclusion. Individuals need to feel comfortable and confident enough to be visible, express their views and ideas, and to be heard. When we really embrace the multitude of perspectives and champion difference, then we achieve equity.Shevaun Walters, Regional Head of Human Resources, APACTo me, embracing equity is about ensuring that everyone, regardless of circumstance or experience, receives equal access to opportunities and what they need to be successful. In order to improve equity, we need to acknowledge there are broad historical barriers or circumstances that have prevented certain individuals from involvement and advancement. As a human resources professional, a leader, and a parent, I do my best to call out discrimination, stereotypes, and exclusion.As we commemorate Women's History Month, International Women's Day, and other celebrations of diversity, we invite you to learn more about our DEI initiatives and how our differences bring us together at www.troweprice.com/diversity.T.

Rowe Price Lead Client Consultant Alexis Willis' daughter was diagnosed at a young age with sickle cell anemia, a common inherited blood disorder affecting red blood cells and that can be fatal without proper treatment and access to blood transfusions. T. Rowe Price Director of Marketing Lee Jokl is a board member for the American Red Cross of Central Maryland. His involvement in the organization was spurred after his son needed several blood transfusions as a baby.Together, Willis and Jokl spearheaded a blood drive event for T. Rowe Price associates as an opportunity for their colleagues to give back to those fighting illness and trauma.The Baltimore-based global investment management firm hosted a two-day blood drive on February 7 and 8 at its Baltimore and Owings Mills locations for associates who were eligible to donate. The events were coordinated in partnership with the firm's MOSAIC African Heritage Community, one of three communities under the multicultural business resource group dedicated to promoting an inclusive culture, as part of its MLK Week of Service and Black History Month agendas.""For my family and many others, blood accessibility is a personal issue; families across the U.S. rely on blood transfusions to care for loved ones who suffer from illness or trauma,"" said Willis. ""I know firsthand how valuable blood donation events are to supporting communities. I am so thankful to the Red Cross and my T. Rowe Price colleagues for putting on these donation events to help families like mine.""Both locations exceeded their individual donation goals with 64 units of blood donated, which will save up to an estimated 192 lives. Nearly 20% of the donations were from diverse donors and will go to support sickle cell anemia patients specifically.""It's not every day you come home from work knowing you potentially saved a life. Today, the T. Rowe Price team can,"" said Jokl. ""Community is at the heart of everything we do at T. Rowe Price, and there is no better way to support our community than protecting the health and wellness of those around us. Blood drives like these make it easy to participate in such a necessary and selfless act.""Story continuesEducation and accessibility to the blood drives aided in the success of these events. The firm hosted a lunch and learn to educate associates on the importance of diverse blood donors. With repeat donors accounting for 69% of U.S. blood donations, according to America's Blood Centers, corporate blood drives like that hosted by T. Rowe Price can help create awareness and easy access to potential donors.The events came at an urgent time for blood donation in Maryland. In a 2022 Baltimore Sun article, Red Cross Spokeswoman Ashley Henyan shared that new donor turnout in Maryland was down more than 30% compared with previous years. Blood donations are often necessary to treat cancer patients, trauma victims, and people with chronic illness.""T. Rowe Price embodies the definition of community and compassionate service,"" Misty L. Bruce, executive director, American Red Cross of Central Maryland. ""I am not surprised that so many employees rolled up their sleeves in hopes of giving someone else another chance at life.""The American Red Cross must collect enough blood every day to meet the needs of accident and burn victims, heart surgery and organ transplant patients, and those receiving treatment for leukemia, cancer, or sickle cell disease. The organization encourages eligible donors of all races and ethnicities to give blood or platelets to increase the diversity of the blood supply.

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum Occidental Petroleum Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Independent Director, Avedick Poladian, for US$1.1m worth of shares, at about US$57.23 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$59.71. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was only 24% of Avedick Poladian's holding.All up, insiders sold more shares in Occidental Petroleum than they bought, over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insider OwnershipI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Occidental Petroleum insiders own about US$116m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Occidental Petroleum Insiders?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Occidental Petroleum shares in the last quarter. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Occidental Petroleum insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Occidental Petroleum (of which 1 is a bit unpleasant!) you should know about.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Please note, today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Neil Backhouse, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Neil Backhouse: Thank you, Rocco. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for participating in Occidental's Fourth Quarter 2022 Conference Call. On the call with us today are Vicki Hollub, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Peterson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Richard Jackson, President, Operations, U.S. Onshore Resources and Carbon Management. This afternoon, we will refer to slides available on the Investors section of our website. The presentation includes a cautionary statement on Slide 2 regarding forward-looking statements that will be made on the call this afternoon. We'll also reference a few non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found in the schedules to our earnings release and on our website. I'll now turn the call over to Vicki. Vicki, please go ahead.Vicki Hollub: Thank you, Neil, and good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, I'll begin with highlights of our 2022 achievements, including an oil and gas update followed by our fourth quarter performance. Next, I'll discuss our 2023 cash flow priorities, our enhanced shareholder return framework and our 2023 capital plan. Rob will then provide an update on the status and mechanics of Oxy's preferred equity redemption before reviewing our fourth quarter financial results and 2023 guidance. In 2022, our record net income of $12.5 billion, generated a return on capital employed of 28%, which is the highest return we have achieved since before 2005. We also delivered record free cash flow before working capital of $13.6 billion, which enabled us to retire more than $10.5 billion of debt and to repurchase $3 billion of common shares.Story continuesOur return on capital employed was enhanced by exceptional performance as our team set multiple operational and productivity records across our U.S. onshore, Gulf of Mexico and International businesses. OxyChem generated record earnings in our Midstream business approximated guidance. Also in 2022, our high-return Permian production grew by 90,000 BOE per day, propelled by outstanding well results. We delivered our best year ever in Delaware new well productivity, 2022, the seventh year in a row that we were able to increase our average well productivity, as shown in our presentation's appendix on Slide 29. Our teams accomplished this by applying our proprietary service modeling and completion designs to our high-quality reservoirs. Well performance, along with our Oxy drilling dynamics and logistics efficiencies, enabled us to achieve reserves replacement ratio driven by our capital programs of over 140% at a cost of $6.50 per BOE, which was less than half of our current DD&amp;A per barrel.With price revisions included, the total reserves replacement ratio was 172%, which increased our year-end 2022 reserves to approximately 3.8 billion BOE. Except for the years of the price collapse in 2015 in the pandemic in 2020, we have replaced more than 100% of our production for at least the last 20 years. With the depth and quality of our shale well inventory and 2 billion barrels of remaining potential in our Permian enhanced oil recovery business, we have the scale to continue our history of reserves replacement. A deep inventory, along with our unique portfolio of short-cycle, high-return unconventional assets paired with low decline conventional assets, OxyChem and our Midstream businesses, we have the capability for long-term sustainability and the flexibility to allocate capital to maximize returns for our shareholders.In 2022, we also made significant progress in developing the capabilities and assets needed to secure a low-carbon future, which is the other key to our sustainability. We started site preparation on our first direct air capture plant and executed several exciting agreements to sell carbon dioxide removal credits to prospective purchasers and industry -- diverse industry sectors. We also secured over quarter million acres of land or approximately 400 square miles to develop carbon sequestration hubs. The fourth quarter of 2022 was a fitting way to wrap up a year of continued operational and financial success. We generated over $2.6 billion of free cash flow, which supported nearly $1.6 billion of balance sheet improvements. We also repurchased $562 million of common shares in the quarter, completing our 2022 share repurchase program.In our business segments, Oil &amp; Gas approximated the midpoint of guidance, despite winter storm Elias impact. Outperformance from the Gulf of Mexico and Al Hosn partially offset storm impacts experienced in the Permian and Rockies. OxyChem exceeded guidance, driven by stronger-than-expected market dynamics, while Midstream and marketing earnings were within guidance. In December, Oxy participated in the recapitalization of NET Power. This is a technology that generates emission-free power generation and has the potential to accelerate emissions reduction efforts in our existing operations and to supply electricity to our direct air capture plants and sequestration hubs. Ultimately, NET Power could be an important emission-free power generator anywhere that has access to natural gas.Among the record set in 2022 were lateral lengths in the Delaware Basin, DJ Basin, Oman and most notably in the Midland Basin where our well Lulu 3641 DP exceeded 18,000 feet to become our longest lateral on record. Remarkably, this well was drilled in slightly over 12 days. Milestones like this showcase our team's focus on safely and efficiently expanding the boundaries of drilling technology. Our teams also achieved an Oxy Delaware Basin record for wedge productivity, averaging a 30-day initial production rate of over 3,000 BOE per day from all wells that came online in 2022. We believe that 2 of our wells in the First Bone Spring in New Mexico and 6 of our wells in the Barnett formation of the Midland Basin achieved initial 30-day production records amongst all operators in their respective formations.In addition, we are continuing to consolidate acreage via trade that enable more capital-efficient, longer laterals, which help to optimize the required infrastructure. The longer laterals, exceptional well productivity and optimized infrastructure, partially offset inflation impacts in 2022, and we expect similar benefits as we progress through 2023. After highlighting 2 of our Gulf of Mexico assets, Horn Mountain and Caesar-Tonga on previous earnings calls, I'm pleased to announce another Oxy production record in our offshore operations. Our Lucius platform surpassed 150 million BOE of gross production in less than 8 years from first oil, becoming the fastest Oxy developed Gulf of Mexico platform to reach this milestone. Internationally, we, along with our partner, ADNOC, achieved record quarterly production at Al Hosn with 85,500 BOE per day net to Oxy.The Al Hosn expansion project is progressing well and remains on track for mid-2023 completion. We expect Oxy's Al Hosn net production to ultimately reach approximately 94,000 BOE per day. We are pleased with the total value we've created for shareholders in 2022, including the debt reduction of $10.5 billion and the $3 billion of share repurchases, along with a successful capital program of $4.5 billion. With our debt from outstanding bonds down to less than $18 billion and consistent with our shareholder framework, we will shift our focus to share repurchases, dividend growth and a capital program that further strengthens our sustainability. Over the long term, we intend to repay maturities and opportunistically retire debt to further reduce our cost structure and strengthen our balance sheet.In future years, we will seek to grow our cash flow and earnings to support increases of our dividend and the continuation of our share repurchase program. While we do intend to grow the absolute value of the company, as part of our value proposition, we also want to increase value per share for our shareholders through dividend growth and the reduction of outstanding shares. Accordingly, our Board of Directors authorized an over 38% increase in our common dividend and a new $3 billion share repurchase authorization, which will trigger a redemption of a portion of the preferred equity. Future cash and earnings growth opportunities could come from our shale and conventional oil &amp; gas assets as well as our chemicals business and ultimately, our Low Carbon ventures business.Turning now to 2023. Our business plan is designed to maximize return on capital and return of capital to our shareholders while also strengthening our future sustainability by prioritizing asset-enhancing investments to support the resilience of Oxy's future cash flows. These investments include $500 million for low decline mid-cycle projects, including the previously announced modernization and expansion of OxyChem's Battleground chlor-alkali plant and a new OxyChem plant enhancement along with Permian EOR in the gulf of Mexico. Of the $500 million that I just mentioned, we plan to spend $350 million on OxyChem projects, which upon completion, we expect will generate a combined annual EBITDA of $300 million to $400 million. We expect the Battleground project to be online in early 2026.The other OxyChem plant enhancement will deliver higher production volumes, enhanced operational efficiency and improved logistics costs. We look forward to providing more detail about this project on a future call. The remainder of the $500 million will be spent in EOR in the Gulf of Mexico. EOR remains a core component of Oxy's asset portfolio and will be essential for our future strategy, so we are glad to return to sustaining capital investment level this year. In the Gulf of Mexico, infrastructure projects, including subsea pumping initiatives to increase the tieback radius and productivity of the existing platforms, will drive higher capital spending compared to recent years. We're also focused on our high-return short-cycle businesses.Oil and gas, Industry, EnergyPhoto by Jason Blackeye on UnsplashI returned to a 2-rig program in the DJ Basin late last year requires additional investment but should begin to moderate production decline by the middle of 2023. In our Permian unconventional business, we intend to run an activity program similar to the second half of last year. Our Permian unconventional assets are best placed to deliver production growth to offset marginal declines elsewhere in our portfolio. Overall, 2023 Permian unconventional capital is expected to decline slightly from 2022 due to the initial capital inflow from the Delaware Basin JV. We anticipate that inflation will continue to be a challenge for our industry this year. In 2023, we expect approximately 15% inflation impact on our domestic Oil &amp; Gas business compared to 2022.As always, we will continue our efforts to reduce and offset inflation by leveraging our supply chain competencies and focusing on continued capital efficiency. Another important aspect of sustainability is the carbon intensity of our operations and what we're doing to address it. We focus on reducing emissions every day as we progress our pathway to net zero. And we've made significant progress over the past few years. Since 2020, our emissions reductions projects have focused on capturing methane and reducing venting and flaring. These projects resulted in a 33% decrease in our estimated company-wide methane emissions from 2020 to 2021 and a 24% decrease in methane emissions intensity of our marketed gas production. We were the first U.S. oil &amp; gas company to endorse the World Bank's Zero routine Flaring by 2030 initiative, and I'm pleased to announce that our U.S. Oil &amp; Gas operations achieved Zero Routine Flaring 8 years ahead of that target.That was a major achievement. Our international operations have implemented projects to significantly reduce routine flaring, and we're on track to meet the World Bank's target well ahead of 2030. In 2023, we also intend to invest in several unique and compelling Low Carbon business opportunities to advance our net zero pathway. Ongoing construction of our direct air capture facility in the Permian and the development of our large Gulf Coast sequestration hubs, including Pore space certification, will be among our expected investments. We anticipate that our first direct air capture, or DAC, plant will complete commissioning and begin to capture carbon in late 2024 and be commercially operational in mid-2025. This timing is a few months later than our original target.As we navigate the current supply chain environment and focus on construction sequencing to support faster optimization and the application of new technologies and innovation. Our 2023 capital investment in these Low Carbon businesses is expected to total $200 million to $600 million, subject to third-party funding optionality for the DAC and the timing of projects. We mentioned on our prior call that our net zero ambitions will our funding outside of Oxy's historical capital allocation program. However, we are prepared to fund our first stack ourselves if utilizing our capital preserves the most value for our shareholders. Our capital plan includes investments in our carbon sequestration business, both through the development of the Gulf Coast hubs we previously announced and through drilling appraisal wells.Investments in other projects that reduce Oxy Scope 1 and 2 emissions will also continue. As part of our strategy to develop Gulf Coast sequestration hubs, we're pleased to announce that we will be working with energy transfer low-carbon development to build a pipeline network from point source emitters in the area through our Magnolia sequestration site in Allen Parish, Louisiana. This pipeline will support our point source carbon capture and sequestration business, which we intend to develop along with our DACs, to help medium- and long-term greenhouse gas emission reduction goals for Oxy and our customers. Before turning it over to Rob, I want to reiterate that our 2023 capital plan focuses on projects that best position Oxy for long-term success.As in past years, we retained a high degree of flexibility, which allows us to adapt to commodity price fluctuations and reduce spending if necessary. Now I'll turn the call over to Rob.Robert Peterson: Thank you, Vicki, and good afternoon, everyone. Last year, we repaid over $10.5 billion of debt and retired all remaining interest rate swaps, breaking on our balance sheet and improving our credit metrics as we seek to regain investment-grade ratings. The completion of our $3 billion share repurchase program moved us closer to returning over $4 per share to our common shareholders, which will begin to trigger a redemption of the preferred equity. Our fasting improved financial position, even compared to 1 year ago, enables us to begin allocating a greater proportion of excess free cash flow to our shareholders in 2023. Today, I'll begin by explaining where we are in terms of partially redeeming the preferred equity, I'll then detail our redemption mechanics in a scenario where the $4 trigger is met.The mandatory redemption of deferred equity is triggered with a rolling 12-month common shareholder distribution, which a cumulative $4 per share. This trigger is evaluated daily based on shares outstanding on the day capital has returned. As of today, we have distributed $3.70 per share additional $0.22 per share is required to reach the $4 trigger. In our presentation, we have included an illustrative example of a $100 million distribution to common shareholders after the $4 share trigger is reached. In conjunction with the common distribution, a $100 million mandatory matching distribution versus a half that will be made, of which $91 million will redeem preferred equity principal with a $9 million or 10% premium. In this example, Oxy would incur a $200 million total cash outlay.This process of mandatory redemption repeats as long as the trailing -- or, share trailing 12-month distribution to common shareholders is greater than $4. There is no limit to exceeding the $4 per share trigger through additional distribution to common shareholders. Consequently, even if the trailing 12-month distribution decline, additional distribution to common shareholders will still trigger partial preferred equity redemption. We expect our refreshed share repurchase program to combine with our $0.18 per share quarterly dividend to enable us to exceed the $4 per share trigger to begin redeeming the preferred equity. While the magnitude and pace of the partial preferred redemption and resulting enterprise value balancing will ultimately driven by commodity prices, we expect our shareholders to benefit in a similar way to the value created in 2022 through debt reduction.I'll now turn to our fourth quarter results. We posted an adjusted profit of $1.61 per diluted share and a reported profit of $1.74 per diluted share. Difference between adjusted and reported profit was already driven by a noncash tax benefit related to new organization of legal entities. As Vicki mentioned, our Board recently authorized a new $3 billion share repurchase program following the repurchase of approximately 47.7 million shares last year for a weighted average cost of below $63 per share. We exited the quarter to approximately $1 billion of unrestricted cash after paying $1.1 billion of debt and retiring $450 million in notional interest rate swaps. For the year, we completed over $10.5 billion of debt repayment, which eliminated 37% of outstanding principal and resulted in a sizable reduction in interest rate -- interest burden.We estimate that the balance sheet improvements executing in 2022 will reduce interest and financing costs by over $400 million per year. Our proactive debt reduction efforts leveled the company's profile of future maturities and so that we now -- so we have less than $2 billion of debt maturing in any single year for the remainder of this decade. Going forward, we intend to repay debt as it matures and may also reduce debt opportunistically. We repaid approximately $22 million in January and do not have additional maturities until the third quarter of 2024, providing us with a clear runway to focus on returning cash to shareholders and partially redeeming the preferred. In the fourth quarter, we generated approximately $2.6 billion of free cash flow, even with inflation continuing to pressure costs and capital spending.Domestic operating expenses were higher than expected, primarily due to the impact of winter storm Elliott, equipment upgrades and platform life extension work in the Gulf of Mexico and inflation. Overhead increased as a result of higher accruals related to compensation and annual environmental remediation. Capital spending in the quarter was higher than expected due to inflationary impacts, investments in attractive OBO projects, scheduled changes leading to activity in higher working areas and rig starts for our Delaware JV. We further improved our liquidity position when Oxy became the first company ever to securitize offshore oil &amp; gas receivables and an amendment to increase our accounts receivable facility by 50% to $600 million. In 2022, we paid U.S. federal cash taxes of approximately $940 million, in line with our previous estimate.As we move into 2023, we expect to have full U.S. federal cash taxpayer as we've utilized all our NOLs and U.S. general business carryforward credits. We expect our full year production to average 1.18 million BOE per day in 2023. As it was the case last year, production in the first quarter is expected to be lower than the preceding quarter due to scheduled maintenance turnarounds, primarily in our international operations. We'll have fewer wells come online in our U.S. onshore business in the fourth quarter, with only about 15% of our Permian wells and 6% of our Rocky wells for the year turning over to production. That said, our overall production trajectory is expected to be smoother in 2023 than the prior year. Throughout 2022, we worked with Colorado regulators and local communities to successfully navigate the permitting process.Our work positioned us to add back 2 rigs in the DJ by the end of 2022. Given the reduced activity levels over the last few years, our Rockies production is likely to be lower in 2023 last year. Production is expected to stabilize in the second half of 2023 once the benefits from the additional rig picked up in the fourth quarter of last year fully materialize. rules in Colorado typically lead to a pad development approach with a linear time to market cycle as compared to simultaneous operations in other shale plays. This operating environment creates negligible additional costs for our development, but this year is expected to have a noticeable impact on time to market as our activity ramps up. The DJ Basin remains an exceptionally high return asset for Oxy, and we welcome the return of sustaining capital levels to that business, which was predicated by the regulatory certainty and permitting efficiency we are now experiencing in Colorado.The production sharing contract we announced last year with Algeria is expected to take effect in March. Once the agreement is in place, net barrels to Oxy will decrease by approximately 15,000 BOE per day, which is reflected in our 2023 guidance. We do not expect a material change in operating cash flow because the tax rate were also reset under the new PSC Operating costs across our Oil &amp; Gas business are expected to approximate the second half of 2022 as inflationary pressures remain in our lower-cost DJ Basin production declines. In the Gulf of Mexico, maintenance work to further reduce plan time -- planned downtime and extend platform lives will impact operating costs. We are also increasing EOR downhole maintenance work and CO2 purchases.On a BOE basis, operating costs may increase internationally due to lower reported barrels of the new Algeria contract. 2022 was an exceptional year for OxyChem as the business exceeded $2.5 billion in income. We expect 2023 to be another strong year by historical standards, that is unlikely to match 2022. Caustic soda prices reached all-time highs in the fourth quarter of 2022, but we are now making downward pricing pressures as the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain. PVC pricing fell sharply in the second half of 2022, but has begun to stabilize. As I've mentioned before, OxyChem's integration across multiple chlorine derivatives enables us to optimize our production mix to what the market demands. We remain optimistic about the business, and our capital investments will further strengthen our margins and competitive position.Looking forward to the rest of 2023 and beyond, we remain dedicated to extending the success of 2022 and advancing our enhanced return framework.

So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. Importantly, Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX) does carry debt. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?What Risk Does Debt Bring?Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. See our latest analysis for Boston Scientific What Is Boston Scientific's Debt?As you can see below, Boston Scientific had US$8.93b of debt, at December 2022, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$928.0m, its net debt is less, at about US$8.00b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Strong Is Boston Scientific's Balance Sheet?We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Boston Scientific had liabilities of US$3.80b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$11.1b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$928.0m and US$1.97b worth of receivables due within a year. So it has liabilities totalling US$12.0b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.Story continuesOf course, Boston Scientific has a titanic market capitalization of US$67.2b, so these liabilities are probably manageable. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward.We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).Boston Scientific has a debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.5 and its EBIT covered its interest expense 4.4 times. Taken together this implies that, while we wouldn't want to see debt levels rise, we think it can handle its current leverage. One way Boston Scientific could vanquish its debt would be if it stops borrowing more but continues to grow EBIT at around 11%, as it did over the last year. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Boston Scientific's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. During the last three years, Boston Scientific produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 75% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.Our ViewHappily, Boston Scientific's impressive conversion of EBIT to free cash flow implies it has the upper hand on its debt. But, on a more sombre note, we are a little concerned by its interest cover. It's also worth noting that Boston Scientific is in the Medical Equipment industry, which is often considered to be quite defensive. Taking all this data into account, it seems to us that Boston Scientific takes a pretty sensible approach to debt. While that brings some risk, it can also enhance returns for shareholders. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.

Meanwhile, operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 91.5% in the fourth quarter of 2022 from 105.0% in the same quarter of 2021, due to increased economies of scale and the Company’s technology-driven operations.Cost of materials were RMB1,493.4 million (US$216.5 million) in the fourth quarter of 2022, representing an increase of 52.5% from RMB979.0 million in the same quarter of 2021, generally in line with the increase in the number of products sold and the increase in sales of materials to partnership stores.Store rental and other operating costs were RMB811.1 million (US$117.6 million) in the fourth quarter of 2022, representing an increase of 28.1% from RMB633.4 million in the same quarter of 2021, mainly due to the increase in labor costs and store rental, as well as utilities and other store operating costs, as a result of the increased number of stores and items sold in the fourth quarter of 2022. Store rental and other operating costs increased proportionately less than revenues as a result of economies of scale.Depreciation and amortization expenses were RMB94.8 million (US$13.7 million) in the fourth quarter of 2022, representing a decrease of 5.6% from RMB100.4 million in the same quarter of 2021, mainly due to the reversal of depreciation expenses for certain leasehold improvements, which was partially offset by the increase of depreciation expenses of additional equipment put into use in new stores in the fourth quarter of 2022.Delivery expenses were RMB379.1 million (US$55.0 million) in the fourth quarter of 2022, representing an increase of 62.4% from RMB233.5 million in the same quarter of 2021, mainly due to the increase in the number of delivery orders.Sales and marketing expenses were RMB173.4 million (US$25.1 million) in the fourth quarter of 2022, representing an increase of 75.7% from RMB98.7 million in the same quarter of 2021, mainly driven by (i) an increase in advertising expenses as the Company continued to make strategic investments in its branding through various channels, (ii) an increase in subcontract service fees to support the Company’s e-commerce business and (iii) an increase in commission fees to third-party delivery platforms which is in line with the increase in the number of delivery orders. Sales and marketing expenses amounted to 4.7% of total net revenues in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to 4.1% of total net revenues in the same quarter of 2021.General and administrative expenses were RMB411.4 million (US$59.7 million) in the fourth quarter of 2022, representing an increase of 5.8% from RMB389.0 million in the same quarter of 2021, mainly driven by (i) an increase in the allowance provided for current expected credit loss after the Company's assessment of its existing financial assets, (ii) an increase in research and development expenses as the Company further strengthens its IT initiatives. The increase was partially offset by the decrease of professional service fees. General and administrative expenses amounted to 11.1% of total net revenues in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to 16.0% of total net revenues in the same quarter of 2021.Store preopening and other expenses were RMB10.4 million (US$1.5 million) in the fourth quarter of 2022, representing an increase of 35.9% from RMB7.7 million in the same quarter of 2021, mainly due to more stores being opened in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter of 2021. Store preopening and other expenses amounted to 0.3% of total net revenues in the fourth quarter of 2022, which was consistent with the same quarter of 2021.Impairment loss of long-lived assets were nil in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to RMB2.4 million in the same quarter of 2021.Losses and expenses related to Fabricated Transactions and Restructuring were RMB8.1 million (US$1.2 million) in the fourth quarter of 2022, representing a decrease of 92.6% from RMB109.4 million in the same quarter of 2021, as the Company had successfully completed its provisional liquidation in March 2022 and substantially resolved all outstanding litigations. The losses and expenses related to Fabricated Transactions and Restructuring consisted primarily of professional and legal fees for U.S. securities litigations and other advisory service fees. Losses and expenses related to Fabricated Transactions and Restructuring amounted to 0.2% of total net revenues in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to 4.5% of total net revenues in the same quarter of 2021.Store level operating profit margin – self-operated stores was 23.6% in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to 20.9% in the same quarter of 2021, primarily due to the benefits of economies of scale from the increased number of products sold.GAAP operating income was RMB313.2 million (US$45.4 million) in the fourth quarter of 2022, representing a GAAP operating income margin of 8.5%, compared to a GAAP operating loss of RMB120.8 million, or a GAAP operating loss margin of 5.0%, in the same quarter of 2021. Non-GAAP operating income was RMB425.6 million (US$61.7 million) in the fourth quarter of 2022, representing a non-GAAP operating income margin of 11.5%, compared to a non-GAAP operating loss of RMB23.6 million, or a non-GAAP operating loss margin of 1.0%, in the same quarter of 2021.

The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company presents these non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by the Company’s management to evaluate operating performance and formulate business plans. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures help identify underlying trends in the Company’s business, provide further information about the Company’s results of operations and enhance the overall understanding of the Company’s past performance and future prospects.The non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. The Company’s non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect the Company’s operations and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Furthermore, these non-GAAP measures may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited. The Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company’s performance. The Company encourages investors and others to review the Company’s financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.The Company defines non-GAAP operating income/(loss) as operating (loss)/income excluding share-based compensation expenses, non-GAAP net income/(loss) as net income/(loss) excluding recurring item of share-based compensation expenses and fair value changes of derivative asset bifurcated from Series B Senior Secured Notes and non-recurring item of provision for SEC settlement and equity litigants, and gain from extinguishment of Series B Senior Secured Notes, and non-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable to the Company’s ordinary shareholders as net income/(loss) attributable to the Company’s ordinary shareholders excluding recurring item of share-based compensation expenses and fair value changes of derivative asset bifurcated from Series B Senior Secured Notes and non-recurring item of provision for SEC settlement and equity litigants, and gain from extinguishment of Series B Senior Secured Notes.For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures to the Most Directly Comparable GAAP Measures” set forth at the end of this earnings release.EXCHANGE RATE INFORMATIONThis earnings release contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. dollars (“US$”) at specified rates solely for the convenience of the reader.

345,1f988846-6003-3879-a62d-5c95e736d51f,COF,2023-03-02,Investing in Capital One Financial (NYSE:COF) three years ago would have delivered you a 34% gain,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-capital-one-financial-nyse-110026220.html,1677754826,STORY,"['COF', 'COF-PJ']","[Buying a low-cost index fund will get you the average market return. But if you invest in individual stocks, some are likely to underperform. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) share price is up 28% in the last three years, that falls short of the market return. Zooming in, the stock is actually down 22% in the last year.So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 3 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for Capital One Financial To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Capital One Financial was able to grow its EPS at 19% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. The average annual share price increase of 8% is actually lower than the EPS growth. So it seems investors have become more cautious about the company, over time. We'd venture the lowish P/E ratio of 5.87 also reflects the negative sentiment around the stock.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Capital One Financial's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Capital One Financial the TSR over the last 3 years was 34%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Capital One Financial shareholders are down 20% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 9.4%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 4%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

The award has been offered by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealValued at $19.6 million, the contract is expected to be completed by August 2024. Per the terms of the agreement, Lockheed will offer non-recurring engineering support to aid qualify the re-designed Data Concentrator Unit and Blade Fold Distributor hardware on the CH-53K aircraft for the Navy.A major portion of the work related to this contract will be executed in Torrance, CA.Benefits of the ContractCountries across the world have been reinforcing their military resources due to intense geopolitical tensions and amplified terrorist threats.Among other combat arsenals and weaponries, military helicopters have been gaining importance owing to advancements and integration of new tactical and logistical features. This has provided ample opportunities for Lockheed Martin to win production and modification contracts for helicopters in the recent times. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.Such contract wins are likely to drive revenues from the Rotary and Mission Systems business segment, which comprises the Sikorsky helicopters including CH-53K.ProspectsThe United States, which is the largest exporter of military weaponries worldwide, is also strengthening its military resources. This is quite evident from the fiscal 2023 budget proposal worth $773 billion put forward by the Biden administration for the Department of Defense, with $56.5 billion planned investments in combat aircraft. Impressively, the defense budget request reflects a 4.1% increase from the fiscal 2022 enacted amount.Such solid budgetary provisions should benefit Lockheed, along with other defense manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC , Boeing BA and Textron TXT , that are also experts in military aircraft manufacturing.Story continuesSince its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft for combat. Northrop Grumman also has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance and aircraft self-protection systems. It also enables warfighters to accomplish missions under any conditions.NOC stock boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.5%.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Textron has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while L3Harris has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that TXT is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.TXT currently has a forward P/E ratio of 14.60, while LHX has a forward P/E of 17.14. We also note that TXT has a PEG ratio of 1.31.

LHX currently has a PEG ratio of 6.64.Another notable valuation metric for TXT is its P/B ratio of 2.13. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities.

The award has been offered by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealValued at $50.8 million, the contract is expected to be completed by July 2026. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will procure eight P-8A Increment 3 retrofit A-kits to include associated special tooling. This modification is aimed at supporting the Navy’s anti-submarine warfare capabilities upgrades.Majority of the work related to the contract will be carried out in Jacksonville, FL.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Furthermore, the company's expertise lies in a wide variety of aircraft components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk. Boeing's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, have resulted in a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such order flows, in turn, should boost the defense business segment’s top line.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like South America, the Asia Pacific and the Middle East are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals. Meanwhile, other nations like Europe and the United States have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest worldwide weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing, the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, thus enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global combat aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 2.5% during 2021-2026, with North America constituting the largest share of this market. Such growth can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities and increased defense spending. These projections should benefit Boeing, along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT.Since its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned combat aircraft. Northrop Grumman also has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance and aircraft self-protection systems that enable warfighters to accomplish missions anytime and anywhere.Story continuesNorthrop Grumman has a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.5%.

It has prompted calls in Congress to pass new railroad safety legislation.Also testifying at the Senate hearing will be EPA regional administrator Debra Shore, Ohio Environmental Protection Agency Director Anne Vogel, and two local officials to address ""environmental and public health threats"" from the derailment.No fatalities were reported after the crash, but residents have demanded answers about potential health risks.Other committees in Congress are investigating the derailment.""The rail industry needs to learn as much as it can from East Palestine, as can the owners of the rail cars,"" the company said.Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has pressed railroads to take voluntary steps to improve rail safety as he pursues new regulations.Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) head Amit Bose, speaking Wednesday in East Palestine, announced a new, nationwide inspection program for tracks and trains on routes that carry hazardous materials.Bose said the FRA is working with the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration to prioritize routes to focus on first. He said visual and automated track inspections would ""assess rail infrastructure, detect potential safety concerns and prevent potential derailments.""On Wednesday, a bipartisan group of senators led by Ohio's Sherrod Brown and J.D. Vance introduced legislation to prevent future train disasters.Story continuesThe bill would require enhanced safety procedures for trains carrying hazardous materials, as well as require wayside defect detectors, a minimum of two-person crews and increased fines for wrongdoing.White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre called the bill a ""good first step."" Buttigieg praised ""the swift bipartisan action now underway in the Senate to advance common-sense regulations that can prevent future disasters.""Buttigieg wants Congress to make it easier to impose new train safety regulations and increase fines for violating safety regulations from the current maximum $225,455 at least ten-fold.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called the bill ""precisely the kind of proposal we need to see in Congress"" and was committed to working with the sponsors to pass it.

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Coca-Cola (KO).Coke currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.55, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 11 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.55 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 11 recommendations that derive the current ABR, eight are Strong Buy, representing 72.7% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for KOBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for KOCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Coke here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Coke, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is KO Worth Investing In?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Coke, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 2% over the past month to $2.59.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Coke. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Coke may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This move lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.47%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.02%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 15.51%.Heading into today, shares of the garbage and recycling hauler had lost 3.21% over the past month, outpacing the Business Services sector's loss of 3.34% and lagging the S&amp;P 500's loss of 2.53% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Waste Management as it approaches its next earnings report date. In that report, analysts expect Waste Management to post earnings of $1.29 per share. This would mark no growth from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $4.87 billion, up 4.4% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $6.09 per share and revenue of $20.63 billion, which would represent changes of +8.94% and +4.75%, respectively, from the prior year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Waste Management. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 1.46% lower within the past month. Waste Management is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.Digging into valuation, Waste Management currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 24.59. This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 22.76.Story continuesIt is also worth noting that WM currently has a PEG ratio of 2.26. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Waste Removal Services was holding an average PEG ratio of 2.73 at yesterday's closing price.The Waste Removal Services industry is part of the Business Services sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 96, which puts it in the top 39% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Whirlpool Q4 Earnings Beat, Sales Lag EstimatesWhirlpool posted fourth-quarter 2022 results, wherein earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while sales lagged the same. Both metrics declined year over year. Results were hurt by the ongoing challenging environment and sluggish demand from rising inflation. The headwinds are likely to recover in the second half of fiscal 2023. Consequently, management issued the 2023 view.Notably, management concluded the strategic review of EMEA. As part of this, the company’s Europe major domestic appliance business will form a new entity with Arçelik. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2023. The company announced the successful buyout of InSinkErator, which has had no material impact on Q4 results.Insight Into Q4The appliance maker delivered adjusted earnings of $3.89 per share, declining 37% from $6.14 in the year-ago quarter. However, the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.23 and our estimate of $3.23.Net sales of $4,923 million dropped 15.3% from the year-ago quarter. The top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,047 million and our estimate of $5,254.2 million. Excluding the unfavorable impacts of foreign exchange, net sales amounted to $5,059 million, down 13% year over year. The downside is mainly due to a one-off supply disruption in North America and drab demand, which somewhat offset favorable price/mix.The gross profit for fourth-quarter 2022 was $645 million, down 39.3% from $1,063 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Ongoing EBIT of $171 million declined 66% from $502 million in the year-ago quarter. The ongoing EBIT margin of 3.5% contracted 510 bps year over year.Story continuesRegional PerformancesNet sales for the North America segment decreased 13.6% year over year to $2,874 million. Excluding the currency impact, sales in the region dropped 13%. The segment’s EBIT plunged 67.1% year over year to $166 million, while the EBIT margin contracted 950 bps to 5.8% due to elevated cost inflation and one-off supply-chain disruption.Net sales for the EMEA segment were down 27.2% year over year to $1,028 million. Excluding currency impacts, sales in the region dipped 18.1%. The metric was hurt by drab demand in key countries. The segment’s EBIT was at a loss of $4 million compared with the year-ago quarter’s earnings of $20 million due to lower volume, cost inflation and unfavorable currency, which offset cost-based pricing actions.Net sales from Latin America remained flat year over year to $831 million, owing to a sequential demand rise in Mexico and Brazil, which offset cost-based pricing efforts. Excluding the currency impacts, sales in the region fell 3.1%. The segment’s EBIT of $49 million declined 12.5% from the year-ago period’s $56 million. The EBIT margin contracted 80 bps to 5.9%, mainly affected by inflation, somewhat offset by cost-saving efforts.Net sales in Asia fell 22.1% year over year to $219 million mainly due to muted consumer demand, which was partly offset by cost-based pricing. Excluding the currency impacts, sales for the region were down 15.9%. The segment’s EBIT of $6 million reflected a 65% plunge from the $17 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The segment’s EBIT margin of 2.7% contracted 320 bps from the prior-year quarter, driven by cost inflation and a top-line decline.Other Financial DetailsAs of Dec 31, 2022, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $1,958 million, long-term debt of $7,363 million and a stockholders’ equity of $2,336 million, excluding non-controlling interests of $170 million.As of Dec 31, 2022, Whirlpool provided cash of $1,390 million from operating activities. It reported a free cash flow of $820 million. WHR incurred a capital expenditure of $570 million in the same period. Notably, capital expenditure is likely to be $600 million for 2022.The company returned $1.3 billion in cash to shareholders with $900 million in share repurchases.OutlookFor 2023, Whirlpool envisions a net sales decline of 1-2% to $19.4 billion. On a GAAP and ongoing basis, Whirlpool expects earnings per share of $16-$18. Management anticipates a tax rate of 14-16% on a GAAP basis and adjusted basis. For 2023, Whirlpool expects cash used in operating activities of $1.4 billion and a free cash flow of $800 million.That said, management is on track with its cost takeout actions and expects $800 to $900 million related to gains from the aforementioned measures and eased raw material inflation.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended downward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted -37.52% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Whirlpool has a strong Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a C. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Whirlpool has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Core market growth and Diversify, Decarbonize and Digitize (3D) strategy are driving the company’s bookings. Also, its realignment activities are helping it capture more margin enhancement opportunities with efficient cost management and higher productivity. For 2023, the company expects bookings of $2.7 billion driven by supportive end markets. Revenues are anticipated to increase in the range of 9-11% from the prior-year reported figure.In February 2023, Flowserve inked a deal to acquire Velan Inc. in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $245 million. The buyout will strengthen FLS’ valves portfolio and build upon its existing assets through the addition of Velan’s premier brands, strong heritage and technical expertise in diverse end markets. Velan will become part of Flowserve’s Flow Control Division (FCD) segment. The deal is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2023.Flowserve utilizes its cash flow to reward its shareholders by distributing dividends. The company paid out dividends worth $104.5 million to its shareholders in 2022.However, FLS has been witnessing supply-chain challenges and logistics problems. Flowserve’s cost of sales increased 5.1% and selling, general and administrative expenses rose 2.3%, year over year in 2022. A potential recessionary environment is expected to weaken its GDP-driven markets, including chemicals and general industries.Foreign exchange is an added headwind for FLS, given its widespread presence in the international markets. A stronger U.S. dollar might dampen the company's overseas business results in the quarters ahead.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the past year, this current Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has increased 9.1% compared with the industry’s 5.1% rise.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked companies from the Industrial Products sector are discussed below:Deere &amp; Company DE presently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

We are pleased with our accomplishments in 2022 and in large measure it gives us added confidence in our future performance. In 2023, we will be celebrating our 25th anniversary and across our management team, we are pursuing future opportunities with a lot of optimism. For purposes of today's call, I will provide summary comments on our performance recap our business strategy and frame our success in terms of our accomplishments over the last half decade. Then Trevor and Justin will review our business and financial accomplishments in greater detail and we will reserve time for your questions. Let me start with Sempra Infrastructure. In 2022, the United States reached an important milestone as an energy exporter.It was the first year that our country became the top exporter of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, while also leading the LNG industry and new offtake contracts that support future development. This supports our view that U.S. LNG exports will more than double by the end of the decade. At Sempra Infrastructure, we built an exciting backlog of LNG development projects that are expected to support that forecasted growth. As one example, Sempra Infrastructure signed more long-term SPAs and HOAs for LNG offtake in the fourth quarter of 2022 than any other market participant. In part, this has allowed us to stay on track in meeting our goal of taking a final investment decision on Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 before the end of the quarter. Outside of our LNG business, we see the continued need to expand and modernize North America's energy networks, particularly in California and Texas.There is a common opportunity set in front of each of our business platforms focused on investments in modern energy infrastructure that accelerate electrification and the transition to cleaner fuels. We expect significant opportunities for investment across all three growth platforms and are affirming our full year 2023 and EPS guidance range of $8.60 to $9.20. Additionally, on the basis of this future opportunity set, we are reiterating our long-term forecast of a 6% to 8% compounded annual EPS growth rate. Consistent with our past practice, our long-term forecast uses the midpoint of current year guidance and is anchored by strong projected rate base growth at our California and Texas utilities. Given Encore's ongoing rate case, I also want to note that we plan to share an updated 5-year capital plan as well as our EPS guidance range for 2024 on our first quarter earnings call.Please turn to the next slide. At Sempra, our high-performance culture, one that is centered around safety and operational excellence, is the foundation for delivering on our mission to build a premier North American energy infrastructure company. Our corporate strategy guides our business activities and continues to be validated by the strength of our overall financial performance. In recent years, we have grown the business, strengthened the balance sheet, delivered an attractive dividend and meaningfully increased our rate base, which continues to be a principal driver in our future growth. Looking ahead, our team is excited about the future in part is because we expect our culture and commitment to excellence will continue creating value through the end of the decade as we extend our position as a leader in the markets we serve and continue to invest in our employees.Please turn to the next slide. Since 2017, we've executed on our strategy to simplify our business model, build our leadership position in some of the largest economic markets in North America and improve our financial performance. We've streamlined our portfolio, exited non-core businesses and extended our regulated utility footprint into Texas by acquiring an ownership stake in Oncor and InfraREIT. Through this strategic repositioning, we've been successful in creating greater scale across our franchise and new growth opportunities. To add context around our financial accomplishments since 2017, we have doubled our adjusted earnings, significantly exceeded a compound annual EPS growth rate of 6% to 8%, increased our combined utility rate base in California and Texas by 300%, all while supporting our balance sheet and maintaining a balanced 50-50 capital structure.It's also important to note that our commitment to this more simplified business strategy has resulted in a strengthened market position, improved business mix, enhanced quality of cash flows and perhaps, most importantly, improved visibility to future growth. Today, in many ways, it is pride in our past that gives us confidence in our future is from Sempra's rich tradition of serving others that we understand our role in society and how we can best meet the expectations of a growing list of stakeholders. While much has changed over the last quarter century, our vision delivering energy with purpose has remained constant as we embrace each new challenge as an opportunity to create innovative forward-looking solutions. To be clear, this is an important time for our company.At Sempra, we understand that modern energy infrastructure is a great enabler of prosperity, health and well-being for billions of people around the world. That is why Sempra is pursuing the dual opportunities of advancing decarbonization and helping to deliver energy security globally, all while improving the resiliency of how we deliver energy in our core markets. With that, I will turn the call over to Trevor to discuss business and financial updates.Trevor Mihalik: Thanks, Jeff. What we would like to do is update you on three things. First, I will provide business updates on Sempra California and Sempra Texas then Justin will discuss Sempra Infrastructure, including notable progress on our LNG export projects, and then I'll wrap up with a review of our financial results. Let me start with Sempra California. Community safety is a core tenet of our culture, and I'm proud to highlight that in 2022, SDG&amp;E completed the hardening of 100% of its Tier 3 high-fire threat district transmission infrastructure. This has been long journey that reflects the dedicated efforts of our employees, extending across more than a decade and have significantly improved community safety. In November, SDG&amp;E received a final decision from the CPUC maintaining its 2022 cost of capital rates of return.In December, SDG&amp;E and SoCalGas received a final decision authorizing the 2023 cost of capital, which preserved both companies' equity layers at 52% and updated SDG&amp;E's and SoCalGas' ROE to 9.95% and 9.8%, respectively, through 2025. Last year, we announced the Angeles Link hydrogen proposal. In December, SoCalGas received CPUC approval to establish a memorandum account that allows the company to track the costs of performing Phase 1 feasibility studies. This is an important milestone in evaluating new opportunities to advance California's decarbonization goals. Moreover, the CPUC directed SoCalGas to include this as part of California's application to the U.S. Department of Energy for Hydrogen Hub federal funding. SoCalGas believes Angeles Link has the potential to serve a significant strategic role in supporting the build-out of a full scale Hydrogen Hub and the transition to a green hydrogen economy in Southern California.As proposed, this would be one of the largest hydrogen infrastructure hubs in the U.S. and would support the decarbonization of hard to electrify sectors in the Greater Los Angeles region, which is one of the largest manufacturing areas in the country. Also, SDG&amp;E and SoCalGas are working closely with their customers and regulators to help mitigate the impacts of unusually high winter prices for natural gas, which has been a challenge all across the western region of the country. From the state of Washington to Wyoming and Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico and California, the Western region experienced a difficult price environment. Fortunately, natural gas prices across the country have dropped more than 65% since December. And here in Southern California, our utilities have also seen price declines in recent weeks and expect that trend to continue, some materials from a recent CPUC on bank as well as a summary of the programs that SDG&amp;E and SoCalGas have in place to support their customers, are included in the appendix of today's presentation.Solar panel, Sun, EnergyPhoto by Vivint Solar on UnsplashFinally, the ongoing general rate cases at SDG&amp;E and SoCalGas established the foundation for meeting the future needs of our customers. It is also important to note that our filings are well aligned with the state's clean energy, safety and reliability goals, and we expect a proposed decision in the second quarter of 2024 with retroactive treatment to the beginning of the year. Moving to Sempra Texas, I am happy to report that Oncor achieved strong employee safety results in 2022, which is a testament to the high-performing culture and operational excellence at our Texas platform. In fact, in a year marked by extreme weather, Oncor had a nearly 5% improvement in its SAIDI reliability score. On the transmission side, Oncor set another company record with 280 new annual interconnection requests in 2022, which is a 30% increase compared to 2021.To put this into context, 2021 was also a record year for the company, which as you think about it, further underscores the scale of growth that continues to come on Oncor system. In 2022, Oncor built or hardened nearly 2,000 miles of T&amp;D lines across its service territory and connected over 2,000 megawatts of wind and solar generation to the grid. By the end of 2022, cumulative connections to Oncor system totaled over 18,000 megawatts of wind and solar generation, representing nearly 40% of ERCOT's total wind and solar resources. The momentum of transmission and distribution growth this year was driven by continued high demand for renewables and strong demographic and premise growth across Encore service territory. Oncor's rate case is on the PUCT open meeting agenda for March 9, and we expect a final order to be voted out in the next 4 to 6 weeks.Oncor has a track record of working constructively with the regulators for the benefit of its customers and to advance the key public policy priorities of the state. In part, these considerations support our view that Oncor will receive a constructive rate case outcome. Since the public proceedings are ongoing, Oncor has not unveiled their new capital plan. In conjunction with its final rate case, Oncor expects to review an updated capital plan with its Board. Afterwards, as Jeff mentioned earlier, we expect to publish our updated 5-year capital plan, which will most likely occur on our first quarter earnings call. I will turn it over to Justin to provide updates for Sempra Infrastructure and progress on development at Port Arthur Phase 1 and Cameron LNG Phase 2.Justin Bird: Thanks, Trevor. I'm excited about Sempra Infrastructure's recent accomplishments and want to highlight some of our key achievements. Sempra Infrastructure has seen a solid year of commercial activity with robust LNG, cross-border renewables and pipeline infrastructure demand, creating a foundation for future growth. During the year, Sempra Infrastructure brought assets online within its Clean Power and Energy Networks businesses, while operations at its Cameron LNG Phase 1 terminal exceeded production targets. On the Pacific Coast, we continue to expect ECA LNG Phase 1 commercial operations to commence in the summer of 2025. Also, both ECA LNG Phase 2 and Vista Pacifico LNG received DOE approvals to re-export U.S.-sourced natural gas from Mexico in the form of LNG to non-free trade agreement countries.Please turn to the next slide. As you all know, we continue to advance our strategy of building out a dual market platform that allows us to efficiently deliver LNG to customers in the Atlantic and Pacific regions. To that end, I am excited to say we have completed the marketing phase for Port Arthur LNG Phase 1. We have carefully structured this development project to reduce risk by fully contracting the long-term offtake securing a fixed price EPC and identifying world-class development partners. In November 2022, we announced the execution of definitive agreements with ConocoPhillips, pursuant to which they would acquire a 30% ownership interest in Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 and take 5 MTPA of offtake from the project. In January, we announced that Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 was fully subscribed at 10.5 Mtpa of definitive long-term take-or-pay contracts with world-class counterparties.We also have a fixed price turnkey EPC contract with arguably the most experienced LNG EPC provider in the U.S., Bechtel. With the completion of marketing and execution of the EPC contract, we're now focused on finalizing the project level debt and equity financing. On the basis of the current financing efforts that are underway, we aim to efficiently raise lower-cost capital and protect Sempra Infrastructure's investment-grade balance sheet. We are targeting Sempra Infrastructure Partners' ownership in the project of between 20% and 30% with ConocoPhillips owning 30% and the balance being sold in the form of a non-controlling interest to one or more investors. This is an exciting project. In this initial phase, we're aiming to generate equity returns in the mid-teens while preserving Sempra Infrastructure's investment grade rating and reducing our equity contributions to the project.As we approach FID, we continue to focus on striking the right balance of efficient financing, risk mitigation and retention of upside from future project cash flows and earnings. Over the past decade, we've successfully built LNG export and other large infrastructure facilities, demonstrating our deep development expertise and capabilities to build world-class infrastructure. I believe this experience serves us well as we aim to bring Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 to FID through construction and ultimately to commercial operations as we execute on our goal of delivering cleaner, more secure U.S. natural gas to global markets. Please turn to the next slide. Turning to Cameron LNG Phase 2. As a reminder, this project is also competitively positioned on the Gulf Coast to export LNG to Europe and Asia.And given that as a brownfield facility, it has a distinct advantage to produce competitively priced LNG. The expansion project remains on track as we advance our key work streams. We outlined last year that our activities are focused primarily on completing the FERC amendment, advancing marketing efforts with the goal of securing long-term offtake agreements and completing the competitive feed process. On the regulatory front, the FERC commitment process that supports the transition from gas turbines to electric drives is progressing well. We received the environmental assessment from FERC citing no adverse impact, which is a positive step toward securing the final authorizations. Turning to marketing. 100% of the expected offtake is subscribed under HOAs our existing partners will take their 50% of production and SI's 50% of volumes is already subscribed under existing HOAs on a back-to-back basis.Next, on engineering, as we have talked about in the past, we're running a competitive feed process between Bechtel and a JGC Zahra joint venture. This process is on track to be completed in the summer of this year, and we would expect to make a final investment decision shortly thereafter. Please turn to the next slide, where I'll turn it back over to Trevor to discuss Sempra's financial results.Trevor Mihalik: Thanks, Justin. Turning to Sempra's financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported fourth quarter 2022 GAAP earnings of $438 million or $1.39 per share. This compares to fourth quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $604 million or $1.90 per share. On an adjusted basis, fourth quarter 2022 earnings were $743 million or $2.35 per share. This compares to our fourth quarter 2021 earnings of $688 million or $2.16 per share. Full year 2022 GAAP earnings were $2.94 billion or $6.62 per share. This compares to 2021 GAAP earnings of $1.254 billion or $4.01 per share. On an adjusted basis, full year 2022 earnings were $2.915 billion or $9.21 per share. This compares favorably to our previous full year 2021 adjusted earnings of $2.637 billion or $8.43 per share.As a reminder, 2022 includes the minority interest sale of Sempra Infrastructure to ADIA that closed in June of 2022. Even after considering this minority interest sale, our strong performance and growing adjusted earnings demonstrate our ability to generate value for our shareholders while providing safe and reliable service to our customers. Please turn to the next slide. The variance in full year 2022 adjusted earnings compared to the same period last year can be summarized by the following: at Sempra California, $161 million of higher earnings from higher CPUC base operating margin, net of higher operating expenses at SDG&amp;E and SoCalGas and $46 million of higher flow-through items related to repairs deduction allowances and self-developed software and other items recorded as a reduction to income tax at SDG&amp;E, partially offset by $52 million of higher net interest expense primarily due to higher debt balances at SDG&amp;E and SoCalGas.At Sempra Texas Utilities, $120 million of higher equity earnings primarily due to rate updates at Oncor to reflect increases in invested capital, higher consumption and customer growth. And at Sempra Infrastructure, $160 million of higher earnings driven by excess production at Cameron LNG Phase 1 and strong production from existing energy networks and clean power assets as well as new assets placed into service and $110 million of higher income tax benefits, partially offset by $250 million of lower earnings driven by the sale of our minority interest in Sempra Infrastructure. Please turn to the next slide. As we near the end of our prepared remarks today, I'd like to take this opportunity to bring this all together and highlight Sempra's investment proposition.We've built a high-performing energy infrastructure company that is well positioned in some of North America's most attractive markets. We're focused on strategically deploying capital in what we believe is within the higher-value, lower-risk portion of the energy value chain and provides significant visibility to growth and shareholder value. At our utilities, this year, we will continue to be focused on advancing our rate cases, which center around making the needed investments to further safety, reliability and decarbonization to serve customers. For Sempra Infrastructure, we're nearing FID for a large-scale LNG project in Texas, dedicated to helping provide energy security to our country's allies and directly supporting the energy transition.With that said, at Sempra, there are a number of open items to be completed this spring, including finalizing the Oncor base rate case and taking FID on Port Arthur Phase 1. That is why, as mentioned earlier, we plan to update our 5-year capital plan on our first quarter earnings call in May and also expect to issue our EPS guidance for 2024 at that time. Our work today gives us confidence in our ability to continue the build-out of one of the largest and most competitive energy networks in North America. By advancing our position as a leader in technology and innovation, we are better positioned to serve customers and create value for our shareholders. That's why today, we're announcing the approval by our Board of Directors of a quarterly dividend of $1.19 per common share, a projected annualized dividend of $4.76.We look forward to continuing our commitment to creating and returning value to our owners by building the energy networks of the future. And with that, this concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now stop and open the line to take your questions.See also 15 Biggest Airplane Manufacturing Companies in the World and 15 Biggest Payment Companies in the World.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

With that, please turn to Slide 4, and let me hand the call over to Jeff.Story continuesJeffrey Walker MartinThank you, Glen, and thank you all for joining us today. We're pleased with our accomplishments in 2022 and in large measure, it gives us added confidence in our future performance. In 2023, we'll be celebrating our 25th anniversary and across our management team, we're pursuing future opportunities with a lot of optimism. For purposes of today's call, I'll provide summary comments on our performance, recap our business strategy and frame our success in terms of our accomplishments over the last half decade. Then Trevor and Justin will review our business and financial accomplishments in greater detail, and we'll reserve time for your questions. Let me start with Sempra Infrastructure. In 2022, the United States reached an important milestone as an energy exporter. It was the first year that our country became the top exporter of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, while also leading the LNG industry and new offtake contracts that support future development. This supports our view that U.S. LNG exports will more than double by the end of the decade. At Sempra Infrastructure, we built an exciting backlog of LNG development projects that are expected to support that forecasted growth. As one example, Sempra Infrastructure signed more long-term SPAs and HOAs for LNG offtake in the fourth quarter of 2022 than any other market participant. In part, this has allowed us to stay on track in meeting our goal of taking a final investment decision on Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 before the end of the quarter. Outside of our LNG business, we see the continued need to expand and modernize North America's energy networks particularly in California and Texas. There is a common opportunity set in front of each of our business platforms focused on investments in modern energy infrastructure that accelerate electrification and the transition to cleaner fuels. We expect significant opportunities for investment across all 3 growth platforms and are affirming our full year 2023 and EPS guidance range of $8.60 to $9.20. Additionally, on the basis of this future opportunity set, we're reiterating our long-term forecast of a 6% to 8% compounded annual EPS growth rate. Consistent with our past practice, our long-term forecast uses the midpoint of current year guidance and is anchored by strong projected rate base growth at our California and Texas utilities. Given Oncor's ongoing rate case, I also want to note that we plan to share an updated 5-year capital plan as well as our EPS guidance range for 2024 on our first quarter earnings call. Please turn to the next slide. At Sempra, our high-performance culture, one that is centered around safety and operational excellence is the foundation for delivering on our mission to build a premier North American energy infrastructure company. Our corporate strategy guides our business activities and continues to be validated by the strength of our overall financial performance. In recent years, we've grown the business, strengthened the balance sheet, delivered an attractive dividend and meaningfully increased our rate base, which continues to be a principal driver in our future growth. Looking ahead, our team is excited about the future in part is because we expect our culture and commitment to excellence will continue creating value through the end of the decade as we extend our position as a leader in the markets we serve and continue to invest in our employees. Please turn to the next slide. Since 2017, we've executed on our strategy to simplify our business model, build our leadership position in some of the largest economic markets in North America and improve our financial performance. We've streamlined our portfolio, exited noncore businesses and extended our regulated utility footprint into Texas by acquiring an ownership stake in Oncor and InfraREIT. Through this strategic repositioning, we've been successful in creating greater scale across our franchise and new growth opportunities. To add context around our financial accomplishments since 2017, we have doubled our adjusted earnings, significantly exceeded a compound annual EPS growth rate of 6% to 8%, increased our combined utility rate base in California and Texas by 300%, all while supporting our balance sheet and maintaining a balanced 50-50 capital structure. It's also important to note that our commitment to this more simplified business strategy has resulted in a strengthened market position, improved business mix, enhanced quality of cash flows and perhaps, most importantly, improved visibility to future growth. Today, in many ways, it is pride in our past that gives us confidence in our future is from Sempra's rich tradition of serving others that we understand our role in society and how we can best meet the expectations of a growing list of stakeholders. While much has changed over the last quarter century, our vision, delivering energy with purpose has remained constant as we embrace each new challenge as an opportunity to create innovative forward-looking solutions. To be clear, this is an important time for our company. At Sempra, we understand that modern energy infrastructure is a great enabler of prosperity, health and well-being for billions of people around the world. That is why Sempra is pursuing the dual opportunities of advancing decarbonization and helping to deliver energy security globally, all while improving the resiliency of how we deliver energy in our core markets. With that, I'll turn the call over to Trevor to discuss business and financial updates.Trevor Ian MihalikThanks, Jeff. What we would like to do is update you on 3 things: First, I'll provide business updates on Sempra California and Sempra Texas then Justin will discuss Sempra Infrastructure, including notable progress on our LNG export projects, and then I'll wrap up with a review of our financial results. Let me start with Sempra California. Community safety is a core tenet of our culture, and I'm proud to highlight that in 2022, SDG&amp;E completed the hardening of 100% of its Tier 3 high-fire threat district transmission infrastructure. This has been a long journey that reflects the dedicated efforts of our employees, extending across more than a decade and have significantly improved community safety. In November, SDG&amp;E received a final decision from the CPUC maintaining its 2022 cost of capital rates of return. In December, SDG&amp;E and SoCalGas received a final decision authorizing the 2023 cost of capital, which preserved both companies' equity layers at 52% and updated SDG&amp;E's and SoCalGas' ROE to 9.95% and 9.8%, respectively, through 2025. Last year, we announced the Angeles Link hydrogen proposal. In December, SoCalGas received CPUC approval to establish a memorandum account that allows the company to track the costs of performing Phase 1 feasibility studies. This is an important milestone in evaluating new opportunities to advance California's decarbonization goals. Moreover, the CPUC directed SoCalGas to include this as part of California's application to the U.S. Department of Energy for Hydrogen Hub federal funding. SoCalGas believes Angeles Link has the potential to serve a significant strategic role in supporting the build-out of a full scale Hydrogen Hub and the transition to a green hydrogen economy in Southern California. As proposed, this would be one of the largest hydrogen infrastructure hubs in the U.S. and would support the decarbonization of hard-to-electrify sectors in the Greater Los Angeles region, which is one of the largest manufacturing areas in the country. Also, SDG&amp;E and SoCalGas are working closely with their customers and regulators to help mitigate the impacts of unusually high winter prices for natural gas, which has been a challenge all across the western region of the country. From the state of Washington to Wyoming and Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico and California, the Western region experienced a difficult price environment. Fortunately, natural gas prices across the country have dropped more than 65% since December. And here in Southern California, our utilities have also seen price declines in recent weeks and expect that trend to continue. Some materials from a recent CPUC En Banc as well as a summary of the programs that SDG&amp;E and SoCalGas have in place to support their customers, are included in the appendix of today's presentation. Finally, the ongoing general rate cases at SDG&amp;E and SoCalGas established the foundation for meeting the future needs of our customers. It is also important to note that our filings are well aligned with the state's clean energy, safety and reliability goals, and we expect a proposed decision in the second quarter of 2024 with retroactive treatment to the beginning of the year. Moving to Sempra Texas. I'm happy to report that Oncor achieved strong employee safety results in 2022, which is a testament to the high-performing culture and operational excellence at our Texas platform. In fact, in a year marked by extreme weather, Oncor had a nearly 5% improvement in its SAIDI reliability score. On the transmission side, Oncor set another company record with 280 new annual interconnection requests in 2022, which is a 30% increase compared to 2021. To put this into context, 2021 was also a record year for the company, which as you think about it, further underscores the scale of growth that continues to come on Oncor system. In 2022, Oncor built or hardened nearly 2,000 miles of T&amp;D lines across its service territory and connected over 2,000 megawatts of wind and solar generation to the grid. By the end of 2022, cumulative connections to Oncor system totaled over 18,000 megawatts of wind and solar generation, representing nearly 40% of ERCOT's total wind and solar resources. The momentum of transmission and distribution growth this year was driven by continued high demand for renewables and strong demographic and premise growth across Oncor service territory. Oncor's rate case is on the PUCT open meeting agenda for March 9, and we expect a final order to be voted out in the next 4 to 6 weeks. Oncor has a track record of working constructively with the regulators for the benefit of its customers and to advance the key public policy priorities of the state. In part, these considerations support our view that Oncor will receive a constructive rate case outcome. Since the public proceedings are ongoing, Oncor has not unveiled their new capital plan. In conjunction with its final rate case, Oncor expects to review an updated capital plan with its Board. Afterwards, as Jeff mentioned earlier, we expect to publish our updated 5-year capital plan, which will most likely occur on our first quarter earnings call. I'll turn it over to Justin to provide updates for Sempra Infrastructure and progress on development at Port Arthur Phase 1 and Cameron LNG Phase 2.Justin Christopher BirdThanks, Trevor. I'm excited about Sempra Infrastructure's recent accomplishments and want to highlight some of our key achievements. Sempra Infrastructure has seen a solid year of commercial activity with robust LNG, cross-border renewables and pipeline infrastructure demand, creating a foundation for future growth. During the year, Sempra Infrastructure brought assets online within its Clean Power and Energy Networks businesses, while operations at its Cameron LNG Phase 1 terminal exceeded production targets. On the Pacific Coast, we continue to expect ECA LNG Phase 1 commercial operations to commence in the summer of 2025. Also, both ECA LNG Phase 2 and Vista Pacifico LNG received DOE approvals to reexport U.S.-sourced natural gas from Mexico in the form of LNG to non-free trade agreement countries. Please turn to the next slide. As you all know, we continue to advance our strategy of building out a dual market platform that allows us to efficiently deliver LNG to customers in the Atlantic and Pacific regions. To that end, I'm excited to say we've completed the marketing phase for Port Arthur LNG Phase 1. We have carefully structured this development project to reduce risk by fully contracting the long-term offtake securing a fixed price EPC and identifying world-class development partners. In November 2022, we announced the execution of definitive agreements with ConocoPhillips, pursuant to which they would acquire a 30% ownership interest in Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 and take 5 Mtpa of offtake from the project. In January, we announced that Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 was fully subscribed at 10.5 Mtpa of definitive long-term take-or-pay contracts with world-class counterparties. We also have a fixed price turnkey EPC contract with arguably the most experienced LNG EPC provider in the U.S., Bechtel. With the completion of marketing and execution of the EPC contract, we're now focused on finalizing the project level debt and equity financing. On the basis of the current financing efforts that are underway, we aim to efficiently raise lower-cost capital and protect Sempra Infrastructure's investment-grade balance sheet. We are targeting Sempra Infrastructure Partners' ownership in the project of between 20% and 30% with ConocoPhillips owning 30% and the balance being sold in the form of a noncontrolling interest to one or more investors. This is an exciting project. In this initial phase, we're aiming to generate equity returns in the mid-teens while preserving Sempra Infrastructure's investment grade rating and reducing our equity contributions to the project. As we approach FID, we continue to focus on striking the right balance of efficient financing, risk mitigation and retention of upside from future project cash flows and earnings. Over the past decade, we've successfully built LNG export and other large infrastructure facilities, demonstrating our deep development expertise and capabilities to build world-class infrastructure. I believe this experience serves us well as we aim to bring Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 to FID through construction and ultimately to commercial operations as we execute on our goal of delivering cleaner, more secure U.S. natural gas to global markets. Please turn to the next slide. Turning to Cameron LNG Phase 2. As a reminder, this project is also competitively positioned on the Gulf Coast to export LNG to Europe and Asia. And given that as a brownfield facility, it has a distinct advantage to produce competitively priced LNG. The expansion project remains on track as we advance our key work streams. We outlined last year that our activities are focused primarily on completing the FERC amendment, advancing marketing efforts with the goal of securing long-term offtake agreements and completing the competitive feed process. On the regulatory front, the FERC commitment process that supports the transition from gas turbines to electric drives is progressing well. We received the environmental assessment from FERC citing no adverse impact, which is a positive step toward securing the final authorizations. Turning to marketing. 100% of the expected offtake is subscribed under HOAs. Our existing partners will take their 50% of production and SI's 50% of volumes is already subscribed under existing HOAs on a back-to-back basis. Next, on engineering, as we have talked about in the past, we're running a competitive feed process between Bechtel and a JGC, Zachry joint venture. This process is on track to be completed in the summer of this year, and we would expect to make a final investment decision shortly thereafter. Please turn to the next slide, where I'll turn it back over to Trevor to discuss Sempra's financial results.Trevor Ian MihalikThanks, Justin. Turning to Sempra's financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported fourth quarter 2022 GAAP earnings of $438 million or $1.39 per share. This compares to fourth quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $604 million or $1.90 per share. On an adjusted basis, fourth quarter 2022 earnings were $743 million or $2.35 per share. This compares to our fourth quarter 2021 earnings of $688 million or $2.16 per share.

We look forward to continuing our commitment to creating and returning value to our owners by building the energy networks of the future. And with that, this concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now stop and open the line to take your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And our first question will come from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim.Shahriar PourrezaJust -- maybe just more broadly on the 6% to 8% growth CAGR from the '23 midpoint base. I mean I guess the question is the cadence of growth that is embedded in that long-term CAGR. And the reason why I ask is the '22 to '23 original midpoints reflect 6% growth in '23. And obviously, we don't have '24 guidance today. So do you anticipate some step-up in growth with maybe regulatory outcomes, SIP projects reaching commercial operations and getting some clarity on the upwards cost of capital revision in California as we move further in plan?Jeffrey Walker MartinSure. Let me provide some context here. You did mention the step up from '22 to '23, which was about 9.25% growth. I'll give you a couple of things that I think will help you on this. One is when you look back over the last 1-, 5-, 10-, 20-year periods of financial performance, we've delivered EPS growth in the range of 6% to 8% or higher. In fact, over the last 5-year, Shar, we've delivered a compound annual growth rate of right at around 11%. So I would also note, over those same periods of time, we've outperformed our sector in total shareholder returns. Second, harking back to 2022, as you alluded to, our 5-year capital plan we launched last year was our largest ever at $36 billion. And you'll recall that over 90% of those dollars were allocated toward meeting our expected rate base growth. And we certainly -- we think that will continue to be a big driver across the balance of the decade. But one of the reasons we have so much confidence in our long-term growth rate is because now we really have improved visibility to a portfolio of growth opportunities at Sempra Infrastructure over the same period. So we feel very good about our 6% to 8% growth rate. I think that we've demonstrated over a long period of time we have the ability inside this organization to grow at a rate faster than that. And we've certainly done that in the last 12 months than we've done it over the last 5 years.Shahriar PourrezaGot it. And Jeff, just -- I was actually referring to the original midpoint on '22 from '23. Just on the '23 guide, I just want to make sure, is there -- is it inclusive of sort of the headwinds around O&amp;M, interest rates, cost of capital that we just saw in California. Just trying to get a sense -- a better idea of what's in and what's upside to '23 and whether there's any tail risks out there that we should be concerned about? Or is it just the fact that you want these events to close?Jeffrey Walker MartinYes. I think it's a combination of both. You'll recall that when we set our 2023 guidance last February. We've come back 12 months later, we've affirmed that guidance. When you look at the 2022 results, obviously, it was record adjusted EPS for our company, really had strong safety results, strong operational results, executed a $7.8 billion capital plan, which we're really very pleased with. But I would note to your point, as we look to 2023, we are going to manage some headwinds, right? Number 1, you referenced one of them which is the ROEs and our California utilities were adjusted down by 25 basis points. We are operating in a higher interest rate environment. Number 2, and Trevor mentioned this one, noncontrolling interest at Sempra Infrastructure today is 10% higher than it was at this time last year. And we're managing some different potential outcomes associated with the Oncor base review. That said, the reason we're confident about our 2023 numbers, and we're going to work hard to beat them is, we have a great plan of execution. It causes us to have a lot of confidence in our guidance. And I would also mention to your earlier question, we have a visibility to one of our largest portfolios of opportunities in the future, and that's why we feel very good about the 6% to 8% growth rate.Shahriar PourrezaPerfect. And then just lastly on the LNG side, Jeff, as you're getting closer to ECA, COD, can you just maybe talk about how the economics of that project kind of stack up in the context of SIP similar returns and earnings contribution, pro rata versus (inaudible) are there sort of some headwinds from the inflationary pressures, interest rates, et cetera, more broadly. So how would the economics? Is that in line with other projects, especially Port Arthur as the next step is -- that's the next big one so...Jeffrey Walker MartinWell, thank you. We're certainly excited about Port Arthur. I noted in Justin's prepared remarks, I think he used the word exciting 4 or 5 times. I think it reflects our excitement inside the company. As separate infrastructure, you've followed us for a long time, Shar. We tend to be very disciplined in how we allocate capital between shareholder distributions and new projects like Port Arthur. Sempra Infrastructure typically targets high single-digit to low double-digit unlevered returns. And we mentioned in our prepared remarks that we do this with the goal of maintaining portfolio equity returns in the mid-teens. We're very excited. I think one of the things Justin talked about is, we think we can do this project on time and on budget. But given the positive interest in the marketplace for the project, I would tell you the returns that I decided we think, are very reasonable. But 1 thing it's worth our audience tracking, which is we also expect to retain certain preferences and economics and the sell-down of our equity and asset optimization initiatives like you've seen us do around debottlenecking, expansion projects and gas supply that could give us returns at levels well higher than our normal target.OperatorAnd our next question will come from Nicholas Campanella from Credit Suisse.Nicholas Joseph CampanellaI just wanted to round out the conversation on just how to think about growth past '23. When we think about the EPS CAGR off the '23 midpoint, does that already incorporate the 5-year CapEx view you'll give us on the first quarter? Does it assume anything for LNG development on top of ECA such as funding for Port Arthur and Cameron 2. Can you just give us a sense of how the next update can affect growth considerations?Jeffrey Walker MartinYes. I appreciate the question. I would remind folks that we brought back our 5-year forecast back in 2021. The convention we've adopted over the last several years has been to work off the midpoint of our current year guidance, which we announced today we feel very solid about our 6% to 8% growth rate. And really, that's looking at the roll forward capital plan from last year of about $36 billion. I think what's exciting for us is we have the opportunity to improve that forecast. Certainly, Phase 1 of Port Arthur is important. And Allen and his team are doing a really good job of managing our rate case outcomes in Texas. So I would just say that, that 6% to 8% growth rate is something that looks conservative relative to our past performance. And I'll tell you that one of the things we talked a little bit in my prepared remarks about how we've repositioned the business over the last 5 years. What's unique today is our visibility into future growth is better than it has been in the past. So we want to get through a couple of big events here in the spring and come back with a more robust capital plan by our May call, and we look forward to having that conversation in greater detail.Nicholas Joseph CampanellaOkay. And then I just wanted to ask just capital allocation question. The dividend increase is 3.9%. We just noticed that maybe a little wise compared to what you kind of executed on historically. Can you just give us a sense of what's driving that? How you're thinking about capital allocation regarding the dividend? And then also the buyback that you outlined last year, just given you have all these new growth opportunities in front of you, that would be...Jeffrey Walker MartinYes. That's a great question. I'll tell you, one of the things that really differentiates good companies from average companies is how disciplined you are in capital allocation. And I'll tell you, we certainly understand the importance of dividend to our investors, and that's why we've consistently grown it over the last 12 years. Our Board has established a projected payout ratio for us between 50% and 60%. What we announced today falls in the 53% range. And I would make a comment that over the last 10 years, we've averaged roughly a 7% increase to our dividend, which we feel great about. But remember, too, that we're investing in our businesses to support organic growth, and that is our most important initiative. And over our history, I think most people would say our focus has been on investing in opportunities to grow our business while balancing that with returning capital to shareholders, just like you talked about. So you have seen us return capital in the form of share repurchases, and we've also been fairly aggressive about returning capital in the form of the dividend. So I guess my concluding point would be in combination, that dividend growth and the planned growth we have in front of the company, we think this strategy has resulted in the relative outperformance of Sempra stock over the last 1-, 5-, 10- and 20-year period relative to our index. We are committed to disciplined capital allocation in a strategic manner that results in increase in shareholder value, it is certainly a priority to our management team.Nicholas Joseph CampanellaOkay. And then if I could just sneak one last one 1 in. Just the NCI sale around Port Arthur, can you just kind of give us a sense of how we should think about that time line? Do you have to take FID first and then pursue it? Just how should investors think about that?Jeffrey Walker MartinYes. I would say we focused on really the last 2 remaining items that we're working on right now is focusing on lining up our nonrecourse debt and also the sell-down of equity, right? And I think if you think about historically, what we've communicated about how we finance projects. We do: step one, we look at project level debt is nonrecourse to our owners; two, we leverage the benefit of partners at the project level. We're very pleased to have ConocoPhillips play in that role in Port Arthur; third, we use capital calls from our partners at Sempra Infrastructure partners. We've got ADIA and KKR in the capital structure and they're going to have an important role in helping us move this project forward. And then finally, as we're doing now, we look to bring in new sources of private equity capital to sell down our interest. So for us, it's all about striking the right numbers to take FID, and you should expect us to execute in a way that economizes calls on our equity while striking the right balance of efficient financing, risk mitigation and retention of upside from future project cash flows.OperatorAnd our next question will come from Anthony Crowdell from Mizuho.Anthony Christopher CrowdellHopefully, 2 easy ones. And I guess -- I don't know if you mentioned it in Shar's question, but Slide 14, you guys talk about maybe basis differential in the Western gas market. Is that an investment opportunity for either the regulated utilities or SIP?Jeffrey Walker MartinI would go back to a couple of first principles here, which is we're very focused on building an infrastructure company. It's one of the reasons that we talked about the reposition of this business back in 2018, really around being an infrastructure business and really removing noncore assets and commodities from our business model. So in the Western region right now, we're focused on working through this Western region gas event. And certainly, we're trying to do that from a customer perspective. We've been relatively aggressive about trying to ensure we're making the appropriate announcements to our customers and put some good programs in place. But no, we're not pursuing a basis differential opportunity. But I would think it might be helpful, Justin, talk about how we think about your asset position, particularly in Texas, Louisiana and Mexico.Justin Christopher BirdYes, sure. Thanks, Jeff. I think -- and I'll harken to something that you said earlier, Jeff, that as a starting point, SI is really focused on long-term contracted cash flows from our infrastructure projects in Louisiana, Texas and Mexico. And I think there's 2 important points to remember there: One, we don't own infrastructure in the Western U.S.; and two, we work to avoid commodity exposure. As you think about ECA LNG in Baja, as you recall, when we took FID decision in 2020, we essentially leased transportation capacity that would allow natural gas to be delivered from the producing basins both in Texas and New Mexico to the project when it comes online in 2025. And in the interim, we look to offset those costs by utilizing that capacity to deliver gas to customers. But given our infrastructure focus, we do this by conservatively hedging our position well in advance, which reduces our market exposure. And you'll notice, as you look in the '22 earnings on a GAAP basis, as a result of those hedges, we have unrealized mark-to-market losses of over $300 million, which represents the difference between our conservative hedges and the market price. So again, as an infrastructure company, we prefer to optimize recurring infrastructure cash flows and minimize our exposure to changes in commodity prices, essentially exchanging price volatility to get recurring cash flows. And I think you'll see that trend continue. We're focused on long-term recurring cash flows from credit-worthy offtakers and that will be our focus at SI.Anthony Christopher CrowdellGreat. And then if I could just follow up, probably also to you, Justin, on the Port Author Phase 1, enter the EPC contract, $10.5 billion fixed price. If you could just give us some more color maybe on the contract. Is there cost-plus agreement or any commodity exposure that maybe SIP or Sempra has with Bechtel? And I'll leave it there.Justin Christopher BirdYes. Thanks, Anthony. So yes, as we've said, that contract is for $10.5 billion. It is a fixed price. There is some escalation components in that as we move towards issuing a final notice to proceed. I think, importantly, let me emphasize again, we're very proud of our selection of Bechtel. They have a history of building projects, LNG projects in the Gulf that have all been on time, on budget and have importantly provided production numbers in excess of what was guaranteed. As we look at our specific EPC contract, there are some very small pieces of that, that would float. But again, we have a contingency in place as does Bechtel to handle those adjustments. So I think, again, looking to Bechtel's history, they delivered on time, on budget, under fixed price EPC contract. So we're very comfortable with the contract. And again, I'll use my word again, I can't tell you how excited we are as we move toward FID prior to the end of this quarter.OperatorOur next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan.Richard Wallace SunderlandIt's actually Rich Sunderland on for Jeremy. Sticking with some of the LNG questions here. I know in the past on the growth rate you've had LNG in the plan. And obviously, the business has changed a lot since then. I believe Port Arthur was upside to the growth rate last year. Just curious if that's still the case this year? Or is Port Arthur now baked in as you approach FID.Jeffrey Walker MartinYes, it's a great question. We're going to update our roll forward 5-year capital plan later this spring. Currently, we're working off of the plan we rolled out last year. We don't typically put projects in our plan unless they've reached FID. So I would view Port Arthur as an upside to our long-term opportunities.Richard Wallace SunderlandGot it. Very clear. And then looking across a range of future LNG projects, are you seeing more interest from Asian buyers versus European buyers for incremental offtake? Curious where interest stands.Jeffrey Walker MartinYes. I would tell you the answer is both, right? So you've gone through a really unique situation in Europe. Most of the contracts for Phase 1 are being launched off the basis of Europe. But I would also note in The Washington Post a few days ago, they talked about the highest ever approval rate for coal plants in China, where they're launching 106 gigawatts of new coal plants. That's 82 new plants going into service. And between China and India, they burn about 70% of all the coal in the world. So there is a big opportunity for energy insecurity in Asia. The long-term market opportunity remains an Asian opportunity. And the great news is we've got a platform that allows us to dispatch efficiently into the Atlantic and the Pacific. And I think that's one of the things that offtakers are excited about doing business with Sempra because of that.OperatorAnd our last question will come from Craig Shere from Tuohy Brothers.Craig Kenneth ShereI'm often accused of getting over my skis, especially on LNG. But looking past PA 1 and Cameron 2, first, could you discuss the logical pecking order at this time between Port Arthur 2, Vista Pacifico and ECA 2.Jeffrey Walker MartinSure, Craig. I'll pass that to Justin, and maybe you can provide some view in terms of how you're thinking about the loading order for development.Justin Christopher BirdYes. Thanks, Jeff. And Craig, I'm never going to assume you don't have a lot of LNG experience. So thanks for your question. I think as you look at the pecking order, again, it can always change, as you will note. About this time last year, the war in Ukraine changed what we thought was our pecking order at that time. But as I think about our opportunities going forward, let me start with Port Arthur Phase 2. I think there's a lot of excitement around a second phase at Port Arthur, would be brownfield, would clearly benefit from sharing of common facilities. And as I think about that development, there's a few key work streams, which, again, is consistent with, Craig, how we've always discussed about how we move forward our LNG projects. First, permitting, Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 has an application in the FERC and the FERC order is pending. Second is commercial. We have MOUs for volumes out of Phase 2 and are discussions with many parties to fill any outstanding volumes. Engineering and construction, we're in discussions with Bechtel about continuous construction and optimizing that process. And as we always do, we are engaged with the credit rating agencies to make sure as we think about financing these opportunities, we find them the most efficient way to finance taking into account credit and returns. So that's kind of Port Arthur. If you ask me the pecking order, I think the second phase at Port Arthur would be next. As we think about Vista Pacifico, I think you're seeing some exciting developments there as we continue to work with the Mexican government and with CFE about really optimizing supply there. There's a lot of interest, as you might expect, given it's out of the Pacific Coast. And as we think about ECA LNG Phase 2, I think you've seen some also exciting developments. If you recall, we recently got our non-FDA permits for both Vista and ECA. The other thing that you may have noticed is we had an MOU that we announced with CFE and Carso, which would be an opportunity to bring additional gas volumes to the Baja area, which could expedite the development of ECA LNG Phase 2. So again, I hate to be the -- being accused of saying excited too much, but I think there are exciting opportunities in the rest of our LNG portfolio.Craig Kenneth ShereGreat. And that kind of tees up a little bit my second question here. I guess on a macro basis in the United States, I'm wondering, Justin, if you have some feel for after remarkable prior 12 months of contracting, what we might see in terms of a slowdown in the next year or 2? And what I'm kind of referring to is that if some partially contracted projects were to cross the finish line, some peers, we could see 80-plus Mtpa of FIDs within 18 months. And we're just wondering if that's just more than the market needs just past mid-decade.Jeffrey Walker MartinWell, this is Jeff speaking. I'll provide a couple of comments, and Justin, feel free to weigh in. We think our view across the decade is very similar with what's been put out by the EIA which is forecasting 130% growth for U.S. LNG across the decade. The 80 million tonnes per annum that you referenced sounds about right, actually. I think actually the DOE might be forecasting slightly more than that. But remember, it's not just American LNG. We're competing against other markets, whether it's Australia or Qatar. There's certainly opportunities potentially at Mozambique. And remember, there's still volumes coming out of Russia, particularly on the North Coast as well as from Sakhalin. So I think one of the things we've noticed is there is a tremendous demand for energy security and affordable sources of energy and natural gas has a very big runway internationally. We may see a decline here in the United States in different regions of the country, but it is a really big opportunity. I think the United States is viewed as a market that has security of supply, and we've got good counterparties and we've got good credit, and we've got deep capital markets. So we're going to see the lion's share of LNG across the globe will be coming from the United States across this decade.OperatorThank you. That concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to Jeff Martin for any additional closing remarks.Jeffrey Walker MartinSure. Just by way of a brief close, we know there are several investor conferences underway today. So we very much appreciate everyone making time to join us. If there are any follow-up questions, per custom, always reach out to our IR team with any additional questions. This concludes our call.OperatorThank you for your participation.

(NYSE:LYB) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for LyondellBasell Industries The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At LyondellBasell IndustriesThe Executive VP &amp; General Counsel, Jeffrey Kaplan, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$990k worth of shares at a price of US$98.99 each. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$97.48. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).Insiders in LyondellBasell Industries didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

In total, insiders sold US$1.1m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of LyondellBasell IndustriesAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Insiders own 0.2% of LyondellBasell Industries shares, worth about US$70m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.So What Do The LyondellBasell Industries Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. Insider ownership isn't particularly high, so this analysis makes us cautious about the company. We're in no rush to buy!

We expanded our vision to include business owners, so it now provides a more holistic view of all the customers we are privileged to serve. And how we will get there, which is the four pillars of our strategy. We've updated these two cornerstones to better reflect the evolution of our company and to ensure our culture adapt to the ever-changing environment we operate in. While our business will continue to progress, we will always seek to maintain the things that make Progressive, Progressive.In today's call, we'll once again focus on the strategy cornerstone and specifically, we'll discuss the pillar of competitive prices. Competitive prices means not just offering the best rate, but also the most accurate rate driven by pricing accuracy, expense discipline and industry-leading segmentation. As we have said for the last few quarters, we believe the major personal auto rate increases are likely behind us. In the fourth quarter, we continued to raise personal auto rates but at a pace slower than in late 2021 and early 2022. While some states are still waiting on filings to be approved by their respective regulators, we believe the majority of states are nearing rate adequacy, and our intent is to continue to increase rates commensurate with future loss trends.Based on public rate filings, we know that our competitors are raising rates to address their own profitability concerns. And as they have done so, we've seen our relative competitiveness improve, which has resulted in improving retention strong quote growth and high conversion. We've now actually seen some competitors surpass our post-COVID rate take, which should help us sustain those improvement trends. As a result, we finished 2022 with the best fourth quarter for personal auto new application volume in our history, which contributed to growing our personal auto PIFs 3% in 2022 while also running a lower acquisition expense ratio than 2021. We're continuously evaluating our media budget, and we'll continue to use media efficiently as we enter 2023, and we will look to capitalize on this hard market.The higher direct acquisition expense ratio in January is indicative of our opportunistic stance, and it reflects the confidence we have of current rate levels in most states at this time. Of course, if the last three years have taught us anything, it's that the future is unpredictable. So, we will continue to monitor the business carefully and navigate as needed to grow as fast as possible while delivering a calendar year 96 combined ratio. As I said in my annual shareholders letter, segmentation is a key facet of our competitive prices pillar, and nowhere is that more evident than in our investment in usage-based insurance products, which will be the topic of today's presentation. Progressive was a first mover in usage-based insurance.We have had a UBI offering since 1996 when we launched our first product called Autograph. This first effort was limited by the technology at the time and required a professional mechanic to install equipment in a customer's car at a considerable expense. That first attempt evolved to TripSense in 2004, which was our first self install option. And then in 2008, we launched MyRate, which is where we first employed cellular technology to upload data to our systems. And then in 2010, we launched Snapshot, which we consider the start of modern UBI program. We moved from our discount-only model to one that included the possibility of a surcharge in 2014. And in 2016, we launched the Snapshot app, which allowed the customer to use a mobile phone app instead of the plug-in device.Our most recent addition is continuous monitoring, which began its rollout in the summer of 2022. In parallel to our efforts in Personal Lines, we were developing UBI for commercial auto products. This culminated in our first broad commercial offering of Smart Haul, in 2018, which allows us to provide usage-based insurance to truckers in partnership with providers of electronic-logging devices. We also expanded the Snapshot program for commercial auto with Snapshot ProView in 2020, which includes fleet monitoring services to small businesses. Throughout our history of usage-based insurance, we have collected billions of miles of data and invested in a process of continuous improvement in our UBI products. Today, UBI is our most predictive rating variable, and it provides unparalleled rate accuracy to our customers.Through this, we've continuously educated our customers where today UBI adoption is at near historical highs. To highlight our UBI products on this call, we've invited two Progressive leaders who've played significant roles in our UBI development. First to speak will be Jim Haas, business leader for our personal auto usage-based insurance. Jim is a 20-year Progressive veteran. And for the last five years, he has led our personal auto UBI team. Jim will discuss the advances we have made in personal auto UBI. Following Jim will be Cory Fischer. Cory is a 19-year Progressive veteran. For nine years, Cory has been our business leader for Commercial Lines R&amp;D. And as of last month, Cory accepted a new role to lead our agency distribution group. During his tenure in Commercial Lines, Cory led R&amp;D during the successful rollout of both our commercial auto UBI products.Cory will be highlighting all of the advances we have made in Commercial Lines UBI, once again giving Progressive first-mover advantage in this important technology. Again, thank you for joining us this morning. I will now hand it over to Jim Haas. Jim?Jim Haas: Thank you, Tricia. As Tricia mentioned, my name is Jim Haas, and I lead Progressive's Personal Lines Telematics efforts. Today, I'd like to tell you about how we've built on that long history in telematics that Tricia discussed starting with how we've continued to improve our core Snapshot program, then moving on to discuss how we can now bring in data from outside sources to improve rating accuracy during the new business quote. And finally, wrapping up with the discussion of some value-added services we'll be bringing to market soon. First, let's recap how our program has worked for a number of years. Individual states may vary a bit, but I'll describe here how it works in most places. We or the agent present the customer with the offer to enroll a Snapshot during their initial quote.If the customer elects to sign up, we'll receive an immediate discount of up to 10% for participating in Snapshot that will be applied to that quote. So long as the customer stays in Snapshot, that discount stays on the policy during the whole first term. During the quote, the customer also elects whether they want to monitor using a plug-in OBD-II device that we send them or via an app on the smartphone. The customer then has 45 days to plug in a device or get the app set up. That point, all they need to do is drive. We'll let them know how they're doing along the way. Just before their policy comes up for renewal, we'll use the driving data collected during that first term to calculate the renewal discount or surcharge. That rate adjustment will be included in the renewal quote and will be applied to future policy terms.At that point, the customer can delete the app or send us back to device and they'll be done monitoring. I'd mention that the rate could go down or it could go up, that is we would apply a discount or a surcharge. But that's not how our program started. In the early days, the program is structured a little bit differently, but a customer's rate couldn't get worse by participating in Snapshot. Customers could receive a discount of up to 30%, but the rate couldn't go up, no matter how risky they're driving look. Many companies still employ a model like this today. Of course, no rating variable in insurance only suggests giving discounts. It's about segmentation and matching rate to risk. So, the data would suggest that some customers should see the rate increase while others should see a decrease.While only offering discounts might encourage more people to participate in the program makes the economics a lot more challenging and limits the accuracy of the overall pricing. And we all know that pricing accuracy is critical in auto insurance. So, starting in late 2014, we began introducing a surcharge. We set our factors so that about a fifth of customers received a surcharge, a share that we've kept about the same over time. The surcharge was small at first, but started us on the path to greater accuracy. It's also when we introduced the participation discount, which is down 10% in most states. Over time, we've moved the price closer and closer to what the data would tell us, first, by increasing the maximum surcharge from 10% to 15%, then increasing it to 20%, and finally, to where we are today.We offer larger discounts than we did in the past, now of up to 30%. But we also have larger potential surcharges than in the past too, now up to 40%. We've come a long way since the days of only offering a discount, but it's important to note that about 75% of customers still receive a discount and only about a fifth receive a surcharge. Not surprisingly, we see better retention on customers who earn a discount and worse retention on those were in a surcharge. Renewal rates for the safest drivers who are earning the biggest discounts are about 6% higher than average, while they're about 16% lower for the riskiest drivers who aren't receiving a discount. So, the program systematically helps us retain lower risk drivers and shed higher risk ones.And because of the changes we made to our Snapshot pricing over the years, were more accurately priced than ever before on those customers that do stay with us. While these changes have certainly improved the accuracy of our pricing, there is still a limitation to our approach. We only use data from a single term, typically 4 to 5 months to set the price for the life of the policy. This made it so we wouldn't know about material changes in an individual's driving behavior would lead to less accuracy over time. We had experimented with a continuous program a long time ago, back in the late 2000s. At the time, though, consumer acceptance of telematics generally was still growing and collecting data on an ongoing basis was quite expensive. So, we decided to move forward with a partial model.Things have changed a lot since then and in early 2022, we started migrating to a continuous version of Snapshot. The basic process isn't all that different. Customers still choose whether and how to participate in Snapshot during the quote and they still receive a participation discount. They still have 45 days to plug in the device or set up the app and then they can just drive. The difference comes after the renewal. As instead of sending the device back or deleting the app, we ask them to continue to monitor, and we'll adjust their rate at each renewal to reflect their more recent driving. Additionally, that participation discount is larger now at 15% instead of 10%, which encourages more people to participate in the program. Having more recent data also improves the predictive power of UBI, which means we can price even more aggressively.We've increased the size of the maximum potential discount to 45% and the maximum potential surcharge to 60%. We're one of the few companies to combine a continuous model with the possibility of surcharges. As of the end of 2022, we had deployed this new continuous model in 12 states, representing over a quarter of our net written premium and plan to roll out to most of the rest of the country during 2023. So, while we've been steepening these factors and requiring longer monitoring to make our pricing even more accurate, what's happened to take rate? The answer is that the share of our personal auto customers participating in Snapshot has moved steadily upward. In fact, it's up nearly 40% across both channels combined since January of 2019.So today, more people participate in Snapshot than ever before, providing data for longer periods of time that we can use to price more accurately than ever before. So, that's the update on what's been going on with our core Snapshot program, which provides great incremental segmentation over what is available via traditional rating variables on renewal policy terms. Now, I want to talk about how we're working to bring this pricing accuracy to where it's most useful at the time of the new business quote. Since in this scenario, the customer is only now just coming to us will have to use telematics data that was collected by others. Our long telematics experience has helped us learn how to use this data and how to make it predictive. We currently have two initiatives in market.The first is a lead generation program that works by inviting good drivers to come and quote with us. While the other begins when a customer comes to Progressive directly to get a quote, and we find and incorporate driving data from third parties into the right we present them. Let me start with the lead generation program. Here, a partner like Credit Karma invites their customer to opt into collecting driving data to see if they could save money on their car insurance. In a privacy-friendly way where we don't receive personally identifiable information, we can let Credit Karma know who's likely to receive a discount so they can invite them to quote with us. Only when the customer chooses to quote, are we able to personally identify that data and are then able to apply that discount to that individual's quote, improving pricing accuracy immediately.Our second program involves working with data collected by automakers. Over the last several years, more and more of them have been equipping their vehicles with technology to collect driving data. They've been working to show the value of these programs to their customers so that they'll sign up to share that data with them. And we've been able to tap into that. When a customer comes to us to quote and their driving data is available, we'd ask the customer if they like us to use it to determine their price. They say, yes, we bring that data in and apply the UBI discount or surcharge to their quote immediately. Again, pushing that rate accuracy to where it matters most, the new business quote. Because of our long experience with UBI and in working with both OBD and mobile data and the fact that we attract so many insurance shoppers every year, we're well positioned to execute and benefit from this.Finance, Business, CorporatePhoto by Scott Graham on UnsplashTo be clear, automakers are in various often early stages of getting the necessary equipment into their cars and making this data available to insurers. Additionally, just because new cars coming off the assembly line have the hardware, it takes a long time for the fleet to turn over. So, this isn't common yet, but we're excited about the opportunity it represents. We're already working with two of the largest double makers, General Motors and Toyota, and it's clear that this population will grow over the coming years. Lastly, I'd like to share some exciting news that doesn't involve using telematics data to more accurately rate policies but instead, builds upon our telematics heritage to provide a valuable service to our customers. Over the last couple of years, we've experimented with offering a service to detect and respond to major accidents to some of our Snapshot customers to learn if they value the service and to better understand how it could be useful in handling claims.We've been encouraged on both fronts as customers have consistently told us that this kind of service is something that they really do value and our claims representatives have seen a telematics data can help them settle claims more quickly and efficiently. Still, we know that despite how times have changed, there is a large segment of customers who don't want their insurance premium to be based on their driving data. That means that if we limit this just to our Snapshot customers, we'd be leaving out a lot of others. So, in March, we plan to start making accident response available to all of our auto customers, not just those who were in Snapshot. We'll use data from the sensors on the phone to detect when a serious crash is likely to have happened.We'll reach out to the customer to confirm the accident and to see if they need help. If we don't hear from a customer at all, and it seems particularly serious, we'll request that the police conduct a well check to make sure our customer is okay. Since we know the customer's location from the telematics data, we know just where to send them. We know there are other accident response services available. We think what we're offering has several key benefits, though, that distinguish it. First, many services come at an additional monthly expense. Ours will come included in the policy. There is no additional charge. This adds value to the customer's relationship with us and can become another reason to choose and to stay with Progressive. Additionally, while other insurers offer crash detection to their UBI customers, we'll be making it available to all of our Personal Lines auto customers, whether they're in Snapshot or not.Third, we're deliberate about dispatching EMS. We certainly wanted to get EMS dispatch as quickly as we can when a customer needs it. But we also don't want to waste EMS resources and bother the customer when they don't. This can be challenging since the sensor data for a near miss and an actual accident can look awfully similar. So, we try to contact the customer more than once using different methods so they can let us know if there was an accident and if they need help. We only send help if the customer has requested or if we haven't been able to reach them after several tries and the accident looks severe. While most customers in these accidents don't actually need ambulance, many do need a tow truck. We're able to build on our roadside assistance experience to meet this need.We understand that those are even more urgent than a typical roadside request. We can also help customers notify their family members. Lastly, after an accident, one of consumers' top concerns is how to get their medical bills paid and how to get their car back on the road. As their insurer, we're the ones positioned to help them get there. By detecting these accidents and having this telematics data able, we're able to get their claim started more quickly and able to handle it more efficiently. In fact, if an ambulance or two is dispatched, we'll actually get that claim started on their behalf. Let me show you an example. This is a real claim that was detected via accident response. In the loss pictured here, our customer was driving on an urban boulevard when they hit some ice, lost control of the vehicle for a striking barricade to their left before striking the barricade on the right.Fortunately, no other vehicles were involved. As you can see, the airbags deployed and there was pretty severe damage to the front of our insurance vehicle. In fact, this vehicle is a total loss. Additionally, our customer and two of their passengers were injured in the crash. Within 2 minutes of the impact, we reached out to our customer. While they didn't response to our initial push notification, they did respond to a subsequent call from a live agent, which occurred less than 5 minutes after the accident that agent dispatched an ambulance and a tow truck to the scene. Only a few minutes later, the claim was filed. Altogether, it took only 10 minutes from the time of the accident to when we had a claim in our system. We've surveyed some of our accident response customers where we've gotten has some great feedback.For instance, this customer showed that they were unable to call for help at the time but help called me. This service helps us help our customers when they need it most. It's not just the immediate response to the accident that can help customers though. Here is another example. This customer collided with another vehicle when changing lanes. We detected this accident as well, dispatched the tow for them and had the claim filed within 12 minutes of the accident. What I want to highlight in this case though, is that this customer had this accident just two days after buying their policy. Some of the first steps in handling any claim include establishing the facts of loss and determining if the loss is covered. Unfortunately, there are people who buy insurance after they had an accident and then try to make a claim for it.This means that honest customers are inconvenienced as we need to take the time to verify that the accident happened when they told us it did. That was pretty easy in this case, however, since we detected the accident in the first place and arranged for the tow truck to pick up the car, and we can see from the telematics data that the crash happened where and importantly when our customers said it did. Therefore, we were very confident that this loss did occur after and not before the customer purchased the policy, which let us move forward more quickly with getting the customer back on the road. So, it's not just the accident response service self, but its promise to improve the claims experience that can benefit our customers. They've told us they value accident response, and we're excited to make it available to them.We'll start that process in March and expect to make it available to all of our personal auto customers over the next year or so. To wrap up, we're not just jumping on the telematics bandwagon. We have decades of experience here. We're clear-eyed about the challenges, but also see the great opportunities telematics offerings present. But this is just the Personal Lines side of the story. My colleagues in Commercial Lines have been developing their own approach about how to use telematics data in their markets, and Cory Fischer, who's led Commercial Lines R&amp;D for the better part of the last 10 years is here to tell us about it. Cory?Cory Fischer: Thanks, Jim. As Tricia shared, I'm Cory Fischer, and up until recently, I was the business leader for Commercial Lines Product Research and Development, which includes responsibility for commercial telematics efforts. Today, I'd like to share the progress we've made since introducing our commercial telematics programs, some early observations and how we're thinking about future investments in this space. The chart on the lower left was shared in a prior Investor Relations call. It's why we're excited and have been investing in telematics. Pricing segmentation is an important part of how we compete. The group I've worked with is charged with advancing our commercial auto segmentation leadership position in the market.Telematics is the most predictive rating variable we have by a lot. To build on that segmentation leadership position we need to be a leader in telematics. For context, we have two branded telematics programs. Smart Haul is the first program we introduced in 2018 after several years of data collection studies and pilots. It targets truckers that are acquired to maintain hours-of-service logs. The launch intentionally coincided with the federal mandate, requiring these truckers to move from paper log books to electronic logging devices. We have recognized those devices provide continuous monitoring and capture very similar data to our Snapshot devices, including location information. With the customer's consent, we use the data from the trucker's electronic login device to generate a score and apply a rating factor.Ideally, we access the data during the quote process, just like the process Jim discussed, using data to price new business. If we are not able to get the data, either there are newer venture without driving history, or we don't have immediate access to their ELD vendor, we provide a participation discount on the quote. Snapshot ProView on the right is more similar to what Progressive Personal Auto has offered. Its target is essentially anyone that doesn't have an electronic logging device. We market Snapshot ProView as safety and savings. For customers that enroll, we provide a participation discount at new business and send a Snapshot device that they can easily plug in. Given how small businesses have employee turnover, this program has continuous monitoring.We will then use their driving data to generate a score and a factor that's applied at renewal. This factor could be a discount or a surcharge. In addition, we provide access to a free driver portal. Our customer can see where their vehicles are and how they are being driven. It's a fairly simple way to keep tabs on their fleet and driving behavior. Since we have deployed these programs, we have been monitoring a number of key metrics. The chart on the right shows a version of take rate, that is, percentage of new business apps and rolling into a telematics program. We've seen from prior program launches, it can take a while and require a sustained effort to get meaningful adoption. Though we have identified opportunities for increasing take rate, we are genuinely happy with how quickly adoption has occurred and the trajectory it's on.In addition to adoption, we have seen that when quotas enroll into a program, they convert at a higher rate than the cohort that's eligible, but chooses not to enroll. We also see that our telematics book of business performs better from a profitability standpoint even after the discount is applied. That's not the longer-term goal. Our intent is to accurately price all segments at target. Between our significant footprint in the commercial auto market, healthy adoption rate and conversion lift, we've built a substantial commercial auto telematics book of business. That book would be a Top 15 commercial auto insurance carrier on its own. In summary, we are really pleased with the growth and performance of our telematics efforts. But we have learned a lot since introducing these programs.One recognition, getting into telematics is not easy. It's not just as simple as adding a new rating variable. It takes broader and sustained effort, new capabilities and investments. For example, we are asking our partners in the independent agent channel to take additional steps to enroll customers, which can include a supplemental app and working through customer reservations with sharing their driving data. That requires an incremental level of support and training. With telematics, we are now dealing with hardware and data transmission. We are also in the logistics business, sending out devices, tracking inventory levels and recently dealing with global supply chain issues. That's a different set of vendors, technical challenges, systems and business processes that we've had to work through.I think the biggest difference is the amount of data that these devices generate. We have to ensure that data is being managed effectively. It's imperative as the data is being transmitted and stored that is handled securely. Also, as the largest commercial auto insurer in the United States, we have a lot of data and have developed effective tools, processes, and skills to manage and model those more traditional data sets. Telematics is an entirely different situation. One truck alone might generate over 1 million records per year. Our traditional approaches aren't nearly as effective, transforming big data sets into variables that we can test and model off of. A big advantage to us is that personal auto through its efforts and investments over the past 20 some years, has established a lot of these capabilities or learnings that we can leverage.For example, our Snapshot ProView program uses the personal auto Snapshot device. Given the volume that personal auto has generated, we have a very competitive cost per device, and that device is already set up to transmit the data back to our secure storage solutions. In terms of big data, personal auto helped us move to their cloud solution, essentially a highly scalable cloud-based data storage and analysis service. This significantly reduces our processing time to analyze data and at a much lower cost than traditional alternatives. They've also provided support as we upskill our team to use these new tools. To summarize this slide, getting into telematics requires a lot of effort. A competitive advantage that we have in Commercial Lines is that our colleagues and Jim's group have already laid a lot of that groundwork that we can either use or learn from.It takes a lot to stand up a leading telematics program and to maintain that leadership takes ongoing investment. I'll share some of those ideas with this slide. Near term, there's a lot that we can do to improve the experience. We have data that shows where customers drop out of the funnel or hit operational hurdles by granting data sharing consent or installing the plug-in device. We have worked with our vendors and have new business processes that will improve both. We have several manual processes in place that support these programs. By automating those, we will lower our program expenses and improve the customer or agent experience. There are a few segments that aren't currently eligible for one of these programs. We're looking to expand eligibility.One example is for our small fleet customers that have their own telematics service, but not electronic logging devices. This could be a service fleet like plumbing. Our intent is to enroll them into a program and access the data from their telematics service provider. Through these near term plans, we'll continue to grow our telematics book, and with that additional data continue to refine and improve our scoring models. We're also excited about new data sources and applications. We're seeing better reception from segments that we target to having dash cams. We've been doing a pilot with dash cams for over a year. There's data from video that we don't capture today, like following distance, which could be valuable, and as Jim shared, we're interested in how telematics can help with the claims process.Dash cams would be an additional input that could be meaningful for claims. We're also using the data to support our underwriting efforts. For now, that might mean verifying other information on the application like radius of operations or garaging Zip code, which are important for us to assess where the vehicle is operated. Sometimes we need to follow up to confirm that the information on the application is correct. We can use telematics data to better target which risks we should follow up on. Our telematics score is currently bolted on to our core model. Given not everyone is in a telematics program, we solve our core model first and then add a telematics score factor for those enrolled. Over time, we plan to move more of the telematics data into the core product, especially where we have those insights at time of quote.Here's an example. This shows one truck's driving pattern for 60 days. On the application, the insured's address and garaging Zip is Elizabeth, New Jersey and they've listed their operating radius as 25 miles. Our model would use information closest to that address to determine a territory factor. Some customers at garage there might never go into New York City. This truck goes lots of different places, but it turns out, there's a fairly regular pattern of going into the city. It's hard to tell from this map, but from the data, let's say 75% of the trips go from Elizabeth into New York City before turning around. A territory factor that puts more weight on the New York City experience would be more suitable. Part of our roadmap is to integrate telematics deeper into our model.I don't see a time we have a telematics only model. We know we get valuable segmentation from non-telematics variables, but there are variables like garaging address and radius, that proxy driving location and where the actual telematics data would be a superior solution. Wrapping up, we've got a great start to our telematics journey. We've got a significant benefit from the experience and investments our colleagues in personal auto have made. And I'm really excited about how we'll continue to use telematics to drive competitive advantage going forward.Doug Constantine: This concludes the previously recorded portion of today's event.

However, natural gas liquids average price realizations decreased 25.6% to $26.02 a barrel. Moreover, average realized natural gas prices fell 5.9% year over year to $4.93 per thousand cubic feet.Meanwhile, production costs were $6.29 per BOE, representing a 28.4% year-over-year rise.Net production of 278,000 BOE/d was down 8.6% from fourth-quarter 2021. Total U.S. output comprised approximately 56% oil, or 156,000 barrels per day (bpd).Lower year-over-year production from Bakken adversely affected the company’s quarterly performance, which was compounded by lower volumes from the Eagle Ford area. The Eagle Ford region recorded an average production of 91,000 BOE/d, down 2.2% from the level in fourth-quarter 2022, while output from Bakken was 94,000 BOE/d compared with 124,000 BOE/d in the year-ago quarter.

Marathon Oil reported an adjusted operating cash flow of $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter, essentially unchanged from a year ago.As of Dec 31, 2022, it had cash and cash equivalents worth $334 million and long-term debt of 5.5 billion. The debt-to-capitalization ratio of the company was 34.2.Marathon Oil spent $344 million in capital and exploratory expenditures during the quarter and raked in $763 million in adjusted free cash flow.2023 GuidanceMarathon has budgeted capital spending between $1.9 billion and 42 billion this year. Meanwhile, MRO continues to prioritize shareholder returns over production growth. The company is targeting production in the range of 385,000 BOE/d to 405,000 BOE/d – up more than 15% (at the midpoint) from last year.Further, Marathon expects oil volumes in the band of 185,000-195,000 barrels per day.

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about UnitedHealth Group (UNH).UnitedHealth currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.45, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 19 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.45 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 19 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 13 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 68.4% and 15.8% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for UNHBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for UNHCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for UnitedHealth here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying UnitedHealth, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is UNH a Good Investment?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for UnitedHealth, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0% over the past month to $24.91.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for UnitedHealth. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for UnitedHealth may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:EL) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Estée Lauder CompaniesOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the President, Fabrizio Freda, for US$5.3m worth of shares, at about US$268 per share. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$246. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).Estée Lauder Companies insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeI will like Estée Lauder Companies better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insiders At Estée Lauder Companies Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Estée Lauder Companies. In total, insider Jennifer Hyman sold US$267k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of Estée Lauder CompaniesMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Estée Lauder Companies insiders own about US$11b worth of shares (which is 12% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Do The Estée Lauder Companies Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider sold Estée Lauder Companies shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Estée Lauder Companies.

If you want to see more high growth non-tech stocks that are profitable, go directly to 5 High Growth Non-Tech Stocks That Are Profitable.High growth stocks can have various definitions. For this article, we define high growth as a company where analysts expect the company to grow its EPS by an average annual rate of at least 10% over the next 5 years.High growth stocks can oftentimes be riskier than blue chip stocks because much of their value is in the future and depends on future growth. If high growth stocks' growth rate slows more than expected, the market could value the perceived value in the future lower.Although many high growth stocks are tech stocks, there are also many high growth stocks in other sectors that aren't in technology.Companies try to grow their earnings in various ways. Some companies buy back a lot of their stock to try to generate more EPS growth if their earnings are relatively stable. Other companies try to acquire the right companies for growth. Yet other companies try to expand organically by developing new products or services or expanding into new markets.Sometimes those growth efforts work and sometimes they don't. When they do work, some companies that are successful in making new profitable products, buying back their stock at the right times, and buying the right companies can grow their earnings faster than 10% a year.The Economic CycleAn average company's growth rate can vary depending on where the economy is in the economic cycle. If the economy is strong and growing, the average EPS growth rate might be a little faster than if an economy is weak and potentially contracting.In terms of where the economy is currently in the economic cycle, it isn't clear where the economy is. Although unemployment is low and the economy is growing, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to continue to raise interest rates. If the central bank raises rates too much, there could be an economic slowdown.Story continuesIn 2022, the growth of many high growth stocks in the technology sector slowed fairly considerably in part due to the rise in interest rates. The valuation of many big tech companies decreased as a result of capital moving from the equity market into the U.S. Treasury market given the interest rate increases.Comparatively, many other non-tech sectors did a little better than the tech sector in 2022 because their valuations weren't as high or weren't as dependent on growth rates.If the future increases in interest rates cause a recession or a substantial economic slowdown, however, the valuations in non tech sectors could also come under pressure. An economic slowdown or recession could negatively affect earnings growth rates of companies in both technology and non technology sectors. It could also affect the future expected earnings growth rates for the next 5 years as well.As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.MethodologyFor our list of 16 High Growth Non-Tech Stocks That Are Profitable, we selected 16 stocks with competitive advantages in sectors other than technology that have an EPS next 5 year ratio of over 10% according to FINVIZ.com.EPS Next 5 Year Ratio is the estimated average annual EPS growth rate in the next 5 years.Given EPS Next 5 Year Ratio is an estimate, it can change from time to time depending on economic events, company specific events, and analyst view changes.We ranked the stocks based on their EPS next 5 year ratio according to FINVIZ.com.We also included trailing twelve month net income data from YCharts.Because we used net income data from YCharts, the net income data might not be adjusted and it could be over different time periods since different companies have different fiscal years.For those of you interested, check out 10 High Growth Low Dividend Stocks to Buy.16 High Growth Non-Tech Stocks That Are Profitable16.

Lowe's and Kohl's both reiterating that 2023 is shaping up to be a challenging year. But there still might be some opportunities within consumer stocks. UBS out today, upgrading Procter &amp; Gamel to buy, raising its price target to 1.63. We have the analyst behind that call. Pete Grom, UBS US Household and Personal Care Analyst, here with us. Pete, great to see you here. So you're bullish on Procter &amp; Gamble now, making the case that the recent underperformance is unwarranted. Why?PETER GROM: Yeah, first off, thank you so much for having me today. It's great to be here. So yes, we think the recent underperformance is a bit unwarranted. You know, first and foremost, some of the underperformance has been related to some of the unwind in some of the defensive sectors we've seen year to date, like consumer staples. But we think one of the bigger concerns has been around the lack of positive estimate revisions.Positive estimate revisions have been a prerequisite for consumer staple stocks to work this year. And we think some of the concerns around Procter &amp; Gamble and the lack of revisions are somewhat misplaced, as we think there's an inflection on the horizon looking out to fiscal '24. We see a path to strong mid-single digit organic revenue growth. This is predicated on, one, low single digit underlying consumption growth, as Procter has exposure to categories that are growing and geographies that are going to see higher per capita consumption.We also see that there's room for shared gains, as the company's been able to do that over the past few years. We also think there's going to still be some room for pricing, albeit somewhat limited, through premiumization. And we also think idiosyncratic benefits like China reopening are also going to benefit. So Procter &amp; Gamble kind of checks all these buckets. And we're kind of layering in a balanced approach in terms of gross margin expansion, but also reinvestment. We see a path to high single digit EPS growth looking out to next year.Story continuesDAVE BRIGGS: Peter, anything you see from Wal-Mart or Target, in terms of the consumer beginning to hold back a little bit and caution from their CEOs, give you a bit of caution on P&amp;G and their pricing power?PETER GROM: You know, it's a great question. You know, I think right now, Procter &amp; Gamble operates in daily use categories. And in daily use categories, brands matter, performance matters. And so while list pricing might be harder to take as we move into the back half of the year this year, there's other revenue growth management drivers that companies are able to [INAUDIBLE] they can kind of take on here.I mean, I think, first and foremost, it's just around innovation. If you provide a product that is going to provide a reason for the consumer to trade up, that is going to not only drive category growth and share gains, but it also provides stronger pricing or mix. So not necessarily any sort of signs right at this point that would point to the categories necessarily slowing or that the consumer is holding back, just given the daily use nature of these categories.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, and, Pete, you've got a great look on the consumer with their coverage list here. You have PepsiCo, Boston Beer, Newell Brands, Monster Beverage, just to name a few. Of the weakness, though, that you are seeing, where is it?PETER GROM: Discretionary items, appliances. So companies like Newell have seen much weaker performance. Even the Yetis of the world have seen weaker performance. These are products that-- or categories that saw outsized growth during the pandemic, both from a result of consumer behavior or people staying at home more, but as well as stimulus, right?And so a lot of these categories maybe typically grew 2% to 3% per year. And from 2020 to 2021, they were seeing mid to high single digit growth. And the consumer is pulling back on purchases of these items, not only because of broader macro weaknesses, but also simply because there's just less need to purchase some of these appliances on an annual basis.DAVE BRIGGS: But with Pepsi in their Q4, what we saw is largely the price hikes are what sustained the profits. But the volume and the demand seemed to fall. Is there a correlation there with P&amp;G?PETER GROM: I think more broadly, last-- pricings are moving up well above historical norms. You're talking, in certain cases, high single digit, low double digit price increases. And there are sticker shocks. The consumer is holding back in terms of the amount of product that they purchase. But what I would say is the elasticities are holding up better than we would have thought. So at the end of the day, I think the consumer-- and this was alluded to on your prior segment-- with unemployment still relatively low, the consumer is still in a pretty OK spot to absorb some of these price increases for some of these everyday use categories.DAVE BRIGGS: All right, Peter Grom, really appreciate that. Good stuff. Thank you.]"

They are not, however, a substitute for U.S. GAAP financial measures. Therefore, the company has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure at the end of the release. The company adjusts U.S. GAAP measures for items not directly related to ongoing operations. However, it is possible these adjusting items have occurred in the past and could recur in future reporting periods. Management also uses non-GAAP measures for goal setting, as a basis for determining employee and senior management awards and compensation and evaluating performance on a basis comparable to that used by investors and securities analysts.About Principal Financial Group®Principal Financial Group® (Nasdaq: PFG) is a global financial company with over 19,000 employees15 passionate about improving the wealth and well-being of people and businesses.

The company has determined this measure is more representative of underlying operating revenues growth for PGI as it removes commissions and other expenses that are collected through fee revenue and passed through expenses with no impact to pre-tax operating earnings.8 Operating margin = pre-tax operating earnings, adjusted for noncontrolling interest, divided by operating revenues less pass-through expenses.9 Combined net revenue (a non-GAAP financial measure): net revenue for all PI companies at 100% less pass-through commissions. The company has determined combined net revenue (at PFG share) is more representative of underlying net revenue growth for PI as it reflects our proportionate share of consolidated and equity method subsidiaries. In addition, using this net revenue metric provides a more meaningful representation of our profit margins.10 Operating margin = pre-tax operating earnings divided by combined net revenue (at PFG share).11 Premium and fees = premiums and other considerations plus fees and other revenues.12 Operating margin = pre-tax operating earnings divided by premium and fees.13 The operating earnings effective tax rate is a non-GAAP financial measure and differs from the U.S. GAAP net income effective tax rate primarily due to net realized capital gains and losses (NRCG) and income (loss) associated with exited businesses through reinsurance.

With a market capitalization of $21.8 billion, the average volume of shares traded in the last three months was 1.5 million.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe rally was largely driven by strong retention and employment growth, improved claim experience, growth in the business and effective capital deployment.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) insurer has a solid track record of beating earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average being 13.76%.Will the Bull Run Continue?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Principal Financial’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $6.90, indicating a 3.6% increase from the year-ago reported figure on 0.5% higher revenues of $13.54 billion. The consensus estimate for 2024 earnings is pegged at $7.58, indicating a 9.8% increase from the year-ago reported figure on 3.9% higher revenues of $14.07 billion.PFG’s revenue growth is expected to improve in the long run, riding on higher premiums and other considerations, fees and other revenues and higher net investment income across its segments.The Principal International segment is likely to benefit from higher single premium annuity sales in Chile. The segment’s operating earnings should gain from foreign currency tailwinds.The Specialty Benefits Insurance business should continue to gain from record sales, strong retention and employment growth. Growth in the business, favorable claims and disciplined expense management should benefit its pre-tax operating earnings.Strong institutional flows across equities, real estate and specialty fixed income highlighting the value of diversified distribution through its institutional, retail and retirement channels are likely to drive positive net cash flow.  Principal Financial’s extensive distribution footprint, strategic buyouts and operational discipline should enhance the assets under management growth.The company boasts a strong capital position with sufficient cash generation capabilities and liquidity. By the end of 2022, its excess and available capital are estimated to be $1.5 billion. Leverage ratio was within the 20% to 25% targeted range.

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 68% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Aflac, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Aflac ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Aflac?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Aflac. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Aflac's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Aflac. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.9%. With 8.5% and 6.9% of the shares outstanding respectively, Japan Post Holdings Co., Ltd., Asset Management Arm and BlackRock, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders. Additionally, the company's CEO Daniel Amos directly holds 0.5% of the total shares outstanding.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of AflacThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Aflac Incorporated insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$328m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 31% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Aflac better, we need to consider many other factors.

The average volume of shares traded in the last three months was about 1.4 million.Disciplined sales trends, strong persistency, an improving rate environment, favorable risk experience and a solid capital position continue to drive Unum’s shares.Unum Group has a favorable VGM Score of A. VGM Score helps to identify stocks with the most attractive value, best growth and the most promising momentum.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 has moved 2 cents north, while the same for 2024 has moved up by 1 cent in the past 30 days, reflecting analyst optimism.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCan It Retain the Momentum?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings indicates an improvement of 3.7% from the year-ago reported figure on 2.6% higher revenues.

It estimates 45-55% growth in adjusted operating EPS by 2024.Unum, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), is the leading disability income writer and the second-largest writer of voluntary business in the United States. Solid operational performance, favorable benefits experience as well as solid top-line growth in the core businesses should continue to fuel growth and help UNM achieve its targeted growth. Management remains focused on moving on to a mix of businesses with higher growth and stable margins. This should help Unum Group’s premium from core business to increase 4-6% over the long term.Unum U.S. continues to benefit from disciplined sales trends, strong persistency in group lines and growth of new product lines like dental and vision, which improve premium income. On the other hand, favorable risk results should aid Colonial Life. Notably, Unum U.S. and Colonial Life are two of the largest operating segments of Unum.Insurers are direct beneficiaries of an improving interest rate environment. The Fed raised interest rates seven times in 2022 and once in 2023, with more on the horizon this year. At its December meeting, the Fed indicated taking the interest rate to 5.1% in 2023 to combat its expected 3.1% inflation. Thus, an improving interest rate environment should aid net investment income.Its sustained solid operating results have been fueling a solid level of statutory earnings and capital, cushioning financial flexibility.Banking on operational excellence, the insurer increased dividends at a nine-year CAGR (2014-2022) of 8%. The dividend yield is currently 3.3%, better than the industry average of 2.3%. UNM also has $200 million worth of share buyback authorization under its kitty for 2023.Story continuesAttractive ValuationUNM shares are trading at a discount than the industry average. Its price-to-book value of 0.96X is lower than the industry average of 1.6X.

In 2001, he went skateboarding with his two sons. Their fun outing ended abruptly when Antawong fell and broke his leg. His injury was severe, so he spent three days in the hospital. Antawong and his wife, Shamon, were filled with worry about how they would pay their medical bills. Then they remembered Shamon had an accident policy with Aflac through her employer.""When Shamon first told me about the Aflac policy years prior to my accident, I told her we didn't need it and to cancel it. Thankfully, she never did. We filed a claim, Aflac paid and I was hooked,"" said Antawong.Antawong was so moved by his experience with Aflac, he walked into the local Aflac office a few days later - on crutches - to ask how he could work with the company. The local team invited Antawong and his family to an upcoming Aflac picnic. Twenty years later, Antawong fondly remembers the warm welcome they received that day.

It has committed to invest more than $3.2 million over the next five years in improving the system’s reliability and security of the acquired assets.Water Industry Needs ConsolidationPer the American Society of Civil Engineers (""ASCE""), more than 50,000 community water systems and 16,000 community wastewater systems in the United States are currently providing water solutions to customers. Per the ASCE finding, due to the delay in essential pipeline repairs and maintenance, 6 billion gallons of treated water is lost every day in the United States. Due to a large number of small operators in the industry and a lack of adequate funds, essential upgrades and repairs of infrastructure get delayed at times.The acquisition of small units by larger utilities ensures necessary investments in infrastructure upgrades and the continuation of high-quality services to customers.

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's 0.47% loss on the day. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.02%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 15.51%.Heading into today, shares of the food and beverage company had gained 1.47% over the past month, outpacing the Consumer Staples sector's loss of 2.47% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 2.53% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from PepsiCo as it approaches its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect PepsiCo to post earnings of $1.37 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 6.2%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $17.11 billion, up 5.59% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $7.22 per share and revenue of $89.12 billion, which would represent changes of +6.33% and +3.16%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for PepsiCo. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.38% lower within the past month. PepsiCo is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Valuation is also important, so investors should note that PepsiCo has a Forward P/E ratio of 24.03 right now. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 23.52.Story continuesInvestors should also note that PEP has a PEG ratio of 3.15 right now. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. Beverages - Soft drinks stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 2.94 based on yesterday's closing prices.The Beverages - Soft drinks industry is part of the Consumer Staples sector.

(NASDAQ:PEP) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for PepsiCo The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At PepsiCoOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Vice Chairman, Hugh Johnston, for US$4.1m worth of shares, at about US$176 per share. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$174. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).PepsiCo insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insider OwnershipFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that PepsiCo insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$365m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The PepsiCo Insider Transactions Indicate?The fact that there have been no PepsiCo insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the PepsiCo insiders selling. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for PepsiCo you should be aware of.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Other pipeline and regulatory updates were also in focus.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories:Moderna’s Q4 Earnings:  Shares of Moderna MRNA were down after the company reported fourth-quarter results. Earnings of $3.61 per share missed Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimates of $4.66 and $4.48, respectively. Earnings declined year over year due to lower revenues and higher operating expenses. Revenues in the quarter were $5.08 billion, which also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.09 billion. Total revenues were down 29.5% year over year due to declining COVID-19 vaccine sales during the quarter.Moderna reiterated its product revenue guidance for 2023. Management expects to record a minimum of around $5.0 billion from COVID vaccine sales in 2023, based on confirmed advance purchase agreements and contract deferrals.Updates From Regeneron:  Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. REGN and partner Sanofi obtained FDA approval for Kevzara (sarilumab) for the treatment of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), an inflammatory rheumatic disease in adult patients who have had an inadequate response to corticosteroids or who cannot tolerate corticosteroid taper. It was earlier approved for moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA).Regeneron also announced the European Medicines Agency’s (“EMA”) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) adopted a positive opinion for Libtayo (cemiplimab) in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy for first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with ≥1% PD-L1 expression.

The CHMP recommendation was based on two pivotal phase III trials (TRuE-V1 and TRuE-V2) evaluating the safety and efficacy of ruxolitinib cream versus vehicle (non-medicated cream). Data showed treatment with ruxolitinib cream improved facial and total body repigmentation.Setback for Cytokinetics: Cytokinetics, Incorporated CYTK received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) from the FDA regarding the new drug application (NDA) for omecamtiv mecarbil, an investigational, selective, small molecule cardiac myosin activator, for the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The regulatory body stated that GALACTIC-HF is not sufficiently persuasive to establish substantial evidence of effectiveness for reducing the risk of heart failure events and cardiovascular death in adults with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, in lieu of evidence from at least two adequate and well-controlled clinical investigations. In addition, the FDA stated that results from an additional clinical trial of omecamtiv mecarbil are required to establish substantial evidence of effectiveness for the treatment of HFrEF, with benefits that outweigh the risks.PerformanceThe Nasdaq Biotechnology Index has lost 1.76% in the past five trading sessions.

Fritz, who has been the company’s CEO since 2015 has decided to step down. The railroad operator intends to appoint Fritz’s successor during the course of the current year.Expressing his gratitude, Fritz stated “It is my honor and privilege to serve this great company. I am proud of our team and all we have built together. Union Pacific has been my home for 22 years and I am confident that now is the right time for Union Pacific’s next leader to take the helm. I look forward to working with the Board as we identify our next CEO to lead the Company into the future.”Even though UNP has tasted success in general during Fritz’s tenure at the helm, the past year has been a tough one due to headwinds like economic uncertainties and high costs. Shares of UNP have shed 17.8% of their value in a year’s time compared with its industry’s 10.6% decline in the same time frame.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLast month, Union Pacific reported lower-than-expected earnings per share and revenues in the fourth quarter of 2022 due to high costs.In fact, the hedge fund Soroban Capital Partners has reportedly been exerting constant pressure to replace Fritz as it holds the opinion that Fritz has lost confidence of shareholders, employees, customers and regulators.. Soroban has also alleged that UNP has lagged its peers in terms of every key railroad operating metric during Fritz’s tenure. Soroban owns roughly a $1.6 billion stake in UNP.With an important stake holder calling for a change at the helm, it will be interesting to see who eventually replaces Fritz. UNP will be hoping that the successor is able to stem the downward movement of UNP shares and bring about a turnaround in its fortunes.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksUnion Pacific currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Transportation sector are American Airlines AAL and Alaska Air Group ALK, both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), presently. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.American Airlines is being aided by the improved air-travel-demand scenario. Owing to upbeat air-travel demand, operating revenues at AAL in fourth-quarter 2022 increased 39.3% year over year. Buoyant air-travel demand is also reflected by the total operating revenue increase of 16.6% from the fourth-quarter 2019 (pre-COVID-19) levels despite 6.1% lower capacity.Driven by soaring demand on healthy bookings, management expects total unit revenues in the first quarter of 2023 to be roughly 24-27% higher than the level recorded in first-quarter 2022. The AAL stock has evidenced the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2023 earnings being revised upward by 100% in the past 60 days.Story continuesAlaska Air too is being aided by the buoyant air-travel-demand scenario. On the back of upbeat air-travel demand and favorable pricing, Alaska Air reported better-than-expected earnings per share in fourth-quarter 2022.Alaska Air expects to boost its fleet and also workforce in 2023 to meet the anticipated high demand. ALK expects first-quarter 2023 total revenues to increase 29-32% from the first-quarter 2022 actuals.

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.On top of the Zacks Rank, investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will want to focus on the ""Value"" category. Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and ""A"" grades for Value will be some of the highest-quality value stocks on the market today.One company to watch right now is Ameriprise Financial (AMP). AMP is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 10.93. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 13.65. Over the last 12 months, AMP's Forward P/E has been as high as 12.71 and as low as 7.92, with a median of 10.52.Investors should also note that AMP holds a PEG ratio of 0.61. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. AMP's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 0.74. Within the past year, AMP's PEG has been as high as 0.77 and as low as 0.58, with a median of 0.65.Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement, so they are often considered a better performance indicator. AMP has a P/S ratio of 2.55. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 2.65.Story continuesFinally, investors should note that AMP has a P/CF ratio of 15.03. This metric focuses on a firm's operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook. AMP's P/CF compares to its industry's average P/CF of 21.80. AMP's P/CF has been as high as 15.71 and as low as 7.92, with a median of 10.91, all within the past year.Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that Ameriprise Financial is likely undervalued currently. And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook, AMP sticks out at as one of the market's strongest value stocks.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With a market capitalization of $21.8 billion, the average volume of shares traded in the last three months was 1.5 million.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe rally was largely driven by strong retention and employment growth, improved claim experience, growth in the business and effective capital deployment.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) insurer has a solid track record of beating earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average being 13.76%.Will the Bull Run Continue?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Principal Financial’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $6.90, indicating a 3.6% increase from the year-ago reported figure on 0.5% higher revenues of $13.54 billion. The consensus estimate for 2024 earnings is pegged at $7.58, indicating a 9.8% increase from the year-ago reported figure on 3.9% higher revenues of $14.07 billion.PFG’s revenue growth is expected to improve in the long run, riding on higher premiums and other considerations, fees and other revenues and higher net investment income across its segments.The Principal International segment is likely to benefit from higher single premium annuity sales in Chile. The segment’s operating earnings should gain from foreign currency tailwinds.The Specialty Benefits Insurance business should continue to gain from record sales, strong retention and employment growth. Growth in the business, favorable claims and disciplined expense management should benefit its pre-tax operating earnings.Strong institutional flows across equities, real estate and specialty fixed income highlighting the value of diversified distribution through its institutional, retail and retirement channels are likely to drive positive net cash flow.  Principal Financial’s extensive distribution footprint, strategic buyouts and operational discipline should enhance the assets under management growth.The company boasts a strong capital position with sufficient cash generation capabilities and liquidity. By the end of 2022, its excess and available capital are estimated to be $1.5 billion. Leverage ratio was within the 20% to 25% targeted range. The statutory RBC ratio for Principal Life Insurance Company is estimated to be 406%, above the midpoint of the targeted RBC ratio range of 400%.Principal Financial’s capital deployment through share buybacks and dividend payment looks impressive.

INFN and Digi International DGII.Industry: Computer NetworkingLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2060285/3-stocks-to-keep-an-eye-on-in-a-troubled-networking-industryIncreasing focus on cloud computing, network security, big data and cloud storage is expected to boost the performance of the Zacks Computer - Networking industry participants. Accelerated deployment of 5G is driving the proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT), Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality (AR/VR) devices and 5G smartphones, calling for solid networking infrastructure. This boosted the demand for networking products, favoring the prospects of prominent industry players like Cisco, Infinera Corp. and Digi International.However, negative impacts stemming from the lingering supply chain disruptions and component shortages are likely to remain a concern in the near term. Geopolitical instability in Europe due to the Ukraine war, weak global economic conditions and rising inflation and crude prices are likely to act as additional headwinds.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Computer - Networking industry comprises companies that offer networking and Internet-connected products, including wireless (WiFi and Long-Term Evolution or LTE), Ethernet and powerline, with a focus on dependability and ease of use. The products are available in numerous configurations to cater to changing requirements of consumers in each geographic territory where it operates for smooth network connectivity and broadband access.Some industry players also provide mission-critical IoT solutions and network security services to help clients build next-generation connected products and implement and manage critical communications infrastructures in demanding environments with enhanced levels of safety. Focus on developing IoT sensors, drones and wearables amid increasing demand for cloud computing-based contact tracing applications is driving the industry.Story continues4 Trends Influencing the Industry's FutureRapid Deployment of 5G to Boost Growth Prospects: Adoption of a hybrid/flexible work model have triggered demand for network-intensive applications like video conferencing and cloud services. This is anticipated to accelerate 5G deployment through 2023 and beyond. The impending 5G boom will likely propel the industry to newer heights.The success of 5G technology hinges on substantial investments to upgrade infrastructure in the core fiber backhaul network to support growth in data services. More efforts to develop smart connected homes, hospitals, factories, buildings and cities and self-driving vehicles bode well for the industry players. The industry players are investing heavily in LTE, broadband and fiber to provide additional capacity and improve Internet and wireless networks. These initiatives hold promise.The Uptick in Wi-Fi 6 Networking to Drive Momentum: Brisk technological advancement, dynamic products, high-speed connectivity, low latency and evolving industry standards define the Computer Networking industry. The growing clout of the latest Wi-Fi 6-compliant residential gateways, Wi-Fi routers, set-top boxes and wireless range extenders is a testament to the same. Wi-Fi 6 — the latest 802.11ax wireless standard — is estimated to offer 30% faster network speed over 802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5). This is anticipated to bolster the industry participants’ top line.Innovation in Networking Technologies is Opening New Business Avenues: Growing clout of Smart Home and Internet-connected products such as Smart TVs, game consoles, High Definition (HD) streaming players, security cameras, thermostats and smoke detectors continue to drive innovations in networking. The rapid proliferation of IoT, the increasing popularity of smart connected devices and the growing adoption of cloud computing in network security are fueling the demand for an efficient network support infrastructure.The advancements in AI and ML and the high adoption of cloud applications hold immense potential for companies in the industry. Enterprises are striving to manage fixed and wireless devices in a secured infrastructure. To address the demand, industry firms are driving innovation in networking technologies, including network virtualization and Software-Defined Networking (SDN), which favors growth prospects.Relative Slowdown in IT Spending A Concern in the Near Term: Per a Gartner report, worldwide IT spending is expected to increase 2.4% in 2023 compared with 2022 levels and reach around $4.5 billion. The research firm’s earlier forecast stood at growth of 5.1%. The geopolitical disruptions, inflationary pressures and protracted pandemic-induced supply chain troubles are a major concern. Consumers are deferring spending on the purchase of devices, which is likely to affect the IT spending growth in 2023. However, the report added that despite headwinds, enterprises are increasing spending on digital business initiatives, which bodes well for industry participants.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak Near-Term ProspectsThe Zacks Computer - Networking Industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 165, positioning it in the bottom 34% of more than 251 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects.

More efforts to develop smart connected homes, hospitals, factories, buildings and cities and self-driving vehicles bode well for the industry players. The industry players are investing heavily in LTE, broadband and fiber to provide additional capacity and improve Internet and wireless networks. These initiatives hold promise.The Uptick in Wi-Fi 6 Networking to Drive Momentum: Brisk technological advancement, dynamic products, high-speed connectivity, low latency and evolving industry standards define the Computer Networking industry. The growing clout of the latest Wi-Fi 6-compliant residential gateways, Wi-Fi routers, set-top boxes and wireless range extenders is a testament to the same. Wi-Fi 6 — the latest 802.11ax wireless standard — is estimated to offer 30% faster network speed over 802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5). This is anticipated to bolster the industry participants’ top line.Innovation in Networking Technologies is Opening New Business Avenues: Growing clout of Smart Home and Internet-connected products such as Smart TVs, game consoles, High Definition (HD) streaming players, security cameras, thermostats and smoke detectors continue to drive innovations in networking. The rapid proliferation of IoT, the increasing popularity of smart connected devices and the growing adoption of cloud computing in network security are fueling the demand for an efficient network support infrastructure. The advancements in AI and ML and the high adoption of cloud applications hold immense potential for companies in the industry. Enterprises are striving to manage fixed and wireless devices in a secured infrastructure. To address the demand, industry firms are driving innovation in networking technologies, including network virtualization and Software-Defined Networking (SDN), which favors growth prospects.
